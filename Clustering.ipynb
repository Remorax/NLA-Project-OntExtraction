The guaranteed estimate of the loss of users of this network is chosen as the criterion of the network performance. A number of formal statements of the problem are proposed for vulnerability analysis. These statements of the problem are studied by flow, graph theoretical, probabilistic, and other methods. The cases when these statements of the problem are polynomially solvable are specified, and the corresponding algorithms are given. In the other cases, it is proposed to use approximation, combinatorial, and other methods.

The guaranteed estimate of the loss of users of this network is chosen as the criterion of the network performance. A number of formal statements of the problem are proposed for vulnerability analysis. These statements of the problem are studied by flow, graph theoretical, probabilistic, and other methods. The cases when these statements of the problem are polynomially solvable are specified, and the corresponding algorithms are given. In the other cases, it is proposed to use approximation, combinatorial, and other methods.

Disclosure Policy  Reporting Guidelines   HID Global's Responsible Disclosure Policy  HID Global believes that the disclosure of vulnerabilities is essential for improving the quality of our products and services, safety of our customers that rely on them, and awareness as to their choices relative to preserving their specific interests. HID Global values insight from the security research community and welcomes disclosure and collaboration with this community.  HID Global values the insight and commitment of security researchers and other vulnerability investigators to make the world a safer place by discovering vulnerabilities of security solutions and providing mechanisms to privately report them with legitimacy and integrity. Responsible disclosure ensures that security access infrastructure is tested and proven reliable. Moreover, the commitment to mitigate vulnerabilities is reassuring for our customers and the security industry as a whole.  The following is HID Global’s responsible disclosure policy :  HID Global will disclose known vulnerabilities and their fixes to its customers in a manner that protects HID product end-users. Disclosures made by HID Global will include credit to the person who first identified the vulnerability, unless otherwise requested by the one who reported it.  HID Global is open to communication and working with security researchers who come to HID Global with a shared interest to improve security and coordinate the distribution of information that includes both the vulnerability and the solution that addresses it.  HID Global will publicly acknowledge in a written advisory the work of a security researcher who brings the company valid information about a vulnerability privately and then works with HID Global to coordinate the public announcement after a fix or patch has been developed and fully tested within a reasonable amount of time to be effective.  Security researchers are allowed to post a link to the HID Global advisory on their own web sites as recognition for minimizing risks for the greater good and helping end-users protect themselves.  We ask the security researcher community to work with HID Global to coordinate the public disclosure of a vulnerability. Pre-maturely revealing a vulnerability publicly without first notifying HID Global could hurt organizations, exposing sensitive information and putting people and organizations in danger of malicious attacks.  This is why HID Global strongly advocates a two-step process: first, private disclosure of a potential vulnerability to HID Global. Once the vulnerability is validated and resolved, HID Global coordinates the public disclosure , which includes the recognition of the security researcher’s discovery, confirming that credit is given to the right person(s).  We also ask that researchers to recognize that our action to investigate, valid and remediate reported vulnerabilities varies based on complexity and severity.

Often times, attackers go straight into exploitation as they have already obtained the IP address range used by the organization. This is a critical mistake as they have not discovered all of the live hosts or open services. Continuing a penetration test without having a solid understanding all of the live hosts, open services and operating systems being used in the environment will often result in the crash of many production systems. Clearly, we’d like to avoid having to explain to the CIO or CISO how we crashed multiple production systems.  Scanning with Metasploit Community Edition  Let us take a look at how Metasploit Community Edition helps us with this critical phase:   First, let us create a new project by clicking on ‘Project’ and then on ‘Create New Project’ as follows:     Please note that we are only required to provide a ‘Project Name’, but we will also provide the ‘Description’ and ‘Network Range’ as follows:     Now that the project has been successfully created, we can begin our scan by clicking on ‘Scan’ as follows:     Confirm IP address range being scanned, configure advanced options such as hosts to exclude or special NMAP switches, and then click on ‘Launch Scan’ when ready:     Sit back, relax and look at how different services are discovered as the scan progresses:     Once the scan is complete, you can examine the results by clicking on ‘Analysis’ and then on ‘Hosts’ as follows:     Click on the IP address or host to obtain more information:     Clicking on the host or IP address displays additional information about the host such as the list of open ports, service information, and so forth. Notice that you have additional tabs such as ‘Vulnerabilities’, ‘File Shares’, ‘Notes’, and ‘Credentials’. Clicking on each tab provides additional information that may be useful during a penetration test.     Exploring a different tab shows us this target is vulnerable to the following vulnerability:    Armed with this information, an attacker can now proceed to the next step: Exploitation!

There were so many vulnerabilities that the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system was changed to accommodate up to 10 million disclosures a year. Of course, not every one of those vulnerabilities was used by attackers and still fewer became exploits that could cause significant damage to an organization. However, the resulting problem for security teams and IT organizations of all sizes is one of information overload—thousands of vulnerability announcements exist and they must be tracked, validated, and, in some circumstances, acted upon.   Summary  The security team in your organization knows that it needs to stay current on the latest security vulnerabilities that threaten your network infrastructure. But with the large quantity of new vulnerabilities from numerous vendors, how can the team analyze and determine the relevance of any single vulnerability to your specific technology architecture?  Based on customer input, Cisco developed the Security Impact Rating (SIR) and vulnerability risk triage methods that customers can use to rapidly determine what action to take in response to a vulnerability report. Working in conjunction with vulnerability scoring methods such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and your organization’s security policies and vulnerability management procedures, the Risk Vulnerability Response Model can help clarify a course of action in a minimal amount of time.   Challenge: Determining the Appropriate Response to a Vulnerability Announcement  Security vulnerabilities will continue to be discovered in technology products and services. These vulnerabilities can be used by attackers to compromise the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of your infrastructure, regardless of whether the vulnerabilities are caused by an unintentional bug or by design, such as a default administrative password.  Hardware and software vendors typically provide fixes when they announce vulnerabilities in their products. If a fix isn't available, vendors attempt to provide a workaround or mitigation. This means there is typically a period of time between the announcement of a security vulnerability in a particular technology and the availability of an attack method (an exploit) for the vulnerability. During this time period, system administrators should take action to protect their systems against an attack because the public knows a vulnerability exists, but attackers are still trying to find a way to take advantage of the vulnerability.  Unfortunately, the vulnerability-to-exploit time period has been decreasing steadily. In the past, the time between a vulnerability announcement and the availability of a corresponding exploit could be measured in months or years. For example, when Microsoft announced a vulnerability on October 17, 2000 (Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-078), the exploit came in the form of the Nimda worm on September 18, 2001, which effectively gave security teams 336 days to patch their systems. In 2004, this timeframe decreased to 17 days when the Sasser.A worm exploited a vulnerability that Microsoft announced in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-011. Similarly, an exploit for the vulnerability disclosed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-051 was available only 16 hours after Microsoft announced the vulnerability. More recently, in the December 2015 Microsoft security update, exploits were available for two of the eight disclosed vulnerabilities when Microsoft made the public announcement. Of course, this trend is not limited to vulnerabilities in Microsoft products. The trend applies to operating systems, applications, and hardware from other vendors.  The vulnerabilities previously discussed went through the established industry practice of responsible vendor disclosure when a software fix or workaround is available. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes information about a previously undisclosed vulnerability emerges on the Internet before the vendor is notified and has time to take action. In these situations, the vulnerability-to-exploit time period is reversed—the attackers have a working exploit for a vulnerability and only the attackers knew the vulnerability existed. This situation is becoming far more common as vendors integrate open source and common third-party software packages. Consequently, public information about vulnerabilities and exploits is often available before the vendor has time to patch images or provide clear guidance to customers.  In October 2015, the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy expanded to disclose vulnerabilities with medium, high, and critical impacts in a unified format. This change makes it easier for organizations to obtain vulnerability information about lower-severity vulnerabilities. However, it also increases the amount of information that security team members must triage. To help organizations deal with this increase, Cisco also made advisories available to registered customers through the openVuln API , a web-based application programming interface.   Preparing for “Day Zero” Threats—Without Panicking  Security teams must prepare for new threats that emerge with little or no warning. Part of the solution to this problem lies in technology. It is increasingly common to include the ability to detect and mitigate attacks on various devices, including routers, switches, security appliances, and end hosts. Proper device hardening and use of security features on these devices can go a long way toward stopping a major outbreak before it occurs.  But even as organizations evolve their technology infrastructure to deal with threats, a security team’s operational procedures must evolve too. If the security team’s procedures for handling vulnerabilities assume a comfortable margin of time between vulnerability disclosure and exploitation, the team might not have enough time to take action before the system is compromised.  It can be overwhelming to track all vulnerabilities. The solution is to have a good process to determine which vulnerabilities are relevant to your organization. This prevents overreaction and the mistakes that can be inherent to rapid, poorly planned upgrades or configuration changes.  Cisco has seen this behavior occasionally when new security vulnerabilities are announced. For many customers, panic ensues. They often learn later that they were not affected by the vulnerability in the first place—either they did not run the affected platform, had other mitigation strategies in place to defeat the attack, or the effect on their organization from a successful attack was much less severe than their initial response indicated. A drawback to this type of panic response is that when a severe vulnerability is announced, the security apparatus of the organization may have become desensitized to the level of urgency that mitigation requires.   The Risk Triage Solution: Right Urgency, Right Understanding  Cisco recommends that customers evaluate the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to understand vulnerability severity. Maintained by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), CVSS is an open framework for communicating the characteristics and severity of vulnerabilities. CVSS scoring helps customers prioritize vulnerabilities by vendor-defined severity, environmental impact, and exploitability.  If customers are not using CVSS, the following vulnerability response model can help customers make quick, informed decisions about a particular security vulnerability based on the severity, relevance, and effect that the vulnerability may have on their organization. The model helps prioritize vulnerabilities so that limited resources can focus on the most impactful issues.  This Risk Vulnerability Response Model is one method of performing triage on a security vulnerability, regardless of vendor. Cisco encourages customers to examine the model, modify it if necessary, and use it to determine the appropriate action for the security team or other affected teams in their organization.  The model should be considered an adjunct to other common best practices for vulnerability management. One element of this model is the impact of the vulnerability. Cisco provides a Security Impact Rating (SIR) to classify vulnerabilities into four categories: Low, Medium, High, and Critical.  Figure 1 illustrates the Risk Vulnerability Response Model. The next section of this paper describes each decision point.  Figure 1. Risk Vulnerability Response Model      Understanding the Model  The Risk Vulnerability Response Model is straightforward to use. It allows members of the frontline security team to determine the relevance of a vulnerability and then initiate the appropriate response process. For each of the four outcomes, Cisco recommends that customers define policies and processes that permit systematic, repeatable responses to security advisories \n"

FIELD OF THE INVENTION  This invention relates generally to security vulnerabilities, and in particular, to aggregating vulnerability information from multiple sources.  BACKGROUND  Security advisories are commonly used to describe information system vulnerabilities. These advisories provide information regarding specific characteristics associated with a vulnerability, such as an affected software platform product, remediation patches, a public disclosure date, a type of impact on the affected platform product, and so on.  Currently, there are many vulnerability advisory producers or sources. These sources span different levels of information detail, product vendors, and public or governmental institutions. Each vulnerability advisory source typically has its own proprietary format, which may overlap the formats used by other sources. Some sources may incorporate into their advisories vulnerability information that other sources do not. Various product vendors or security institutions such as the Computer Emergency Response Team—Coordination Centre (CERT/CC) operated by the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute or the SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security (SANS) Institute, for instance, produce vulnerability notes on a regular basis. The heterogeneous nature of vulnerability information sources can result in a lack of consistency among vulnerability advisories.  Although there are de-facto standards for various aspects of vulnerability information reporting, not all sources use those standards. Even where multiple sources provide advisories formatted in accordance with the same standard, the particular types and content of the vulnerability information provided by those sources may vary.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) scheme gives a unique name to a vulnerability that may have been found by multiple entities. This assures that disparate vulnerability databases will still use a common name for the same vulnerability. CVE provides a way to identify information for the same vulnerability in different data feeds, by associating a specific name with a vulnerability. This name, along with a short description of the vulnerability, is made publicly available via a centralized repository. Vulnerability information sources using the CVE naming scheme can then provide vulnerability information for the same vulnerability using a common name. This approach, however, only links vulnerabilities from different sources, providing all of the sources support the CVE naming scheme, without consolidating the actual content associated with different vulnerabilities identified under the same CVE name. The CVE scheme relates only to vulnerability naming, and does not specify a format or content for vulnerability information that may be associated with a named vulnerability.  The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) was developed through the National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC) and is currently administered by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST). The CVSS provides a common scheme and process for evaluating vulnerabilities according to particular criteria. Although the CVSS scheme is intended to be objective, different entities generally have different experience and knowledge of exploited platforms, for example, such that the same vulnerability may be assigned different CVSS scores by different sources. Further, while the CVSS includes a rating scheme against particular criteria, information details about a vulnerability are still left to the format of each source.  Manually compiling and making consistent vulnerability information from multiple sources, and for an increasing number of new vulnerabilities, is not only labor intensive but also error prone.  In addition to the “formatting” aspects of the problem, there is an additional “historical” aspect. Over time, some of the sources may vanish or relocate to different web site for instance, some advisories may vanish, some may change subscription requirements, and indeed some sources may be “push-only” sources. Given all of these different problems, it is difficult to gather a complete set of the advisories.  Thus, there remains a need for improved vulnerability information handling techniques.  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  Having a consistent way to exhaustively inventory and describe vulnerabilities is of critical interest in the area of vulnerability management. Maintaining an up-to-date and accurate view of a vulnerability landscape is a key requirement for cost-effective management of information system security features. With an increasing number of new discovered vulnerabilities, it is becoming desirable to automate this process.  It may also be desirable to allow an aggregation policy, which specifies vulnerability information distribution parameters for vulnerability information consumers, to be changed “retro-actively”. For example, although a particular service running on some system may be currently rated as unimportant, subsequent business changes may well make that service critical. This means that a vulnerability that was previously considered not to be important may become critical. In some embodiments of the invention, existing vulnerability information associated with such a vulnerability can be retro-actively aggregated and included in a vulnerability information feed for a customer responsive to a change in the customer's aggregation policy.  Embodiments of the invention relate to aggregating vulnerability information, such as vulnerability advisories, to provide a unified and consolidated view of the vulnerability management landscape.  According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus that includes an interface for receiving from a plurality of sources vulnerability information associated with a particular security vulnerability, and an aggregator, operatively coupled to the interface, for receiving the vulnerability information through the interface, and for aggregating the vulnerability information received from the plurality of sources into a unified vulnerability definition associated with the security vulnerability.  The interface may include a plurality of interfaces. Each interface of the plurality of interfaces is configured to receive vulnerability information from a respective group of one or more sources.  The aggregator may include a plurality of format adapters operatively coupled to the interface, with each format adapter being configured to convert a format of vulnerability information received from a respective source into a format of the unified vulnerability definition.  In one embodiment, the aggregator includes a content aggregator operatively coupled to the interface and configured to determine a portion of the unified vulnerability definition based on corresponding portions of the vulnerability information received from the plurality of sources.  The content aggregator may be further configured to detect a conflict between vulnerability information received from different sources of the plurality of sources. In this-case, the aggregator may include a conflict resolution module operatively coupled to the content aggregator and configured to resolve a conflict detected by the content aggregator. The content aggregator may also or instead include a conflict alert module operatively coupled to the content aggregator and configured to allow a user to resolve a conflict detected by the content aggregator.  The vulnerability information received from each source may include respective source content arranged according to a respective source format. A plurality of format adapters may be operatively coupled to the interface, and configured to convert vulnerability information from respective source formats into a format of the unified vulnerability definition. A content aggregator operatively coupled to the plurality of format adapters is configured to determine a portion of content in the unified vulnerability definition format based on corresponding portions of source content in the converted vulnerability information received from the plurality of sources.  The apparatus may also include a user interface, operatively coupled to the aggregator, for providing a representation of the unified vulnerability definition.  In some embodiments, the apparatus includes one or more output interfaces operatively coupled to the aggregator. Each output interface is configured to transmit the unified vulnerability definition to a respective group of one or more vulnerability information consumers.  A policies store operatively coupled to the aggregator may store one or more aggregation policies. The one or more aggregation policies specify respective sets of distribution parameters for one or more vulnerability information consumers. Where the interface is configured for receiving from the plurality of sources vulnerability information associated with a plurality of security vulnerabilities, the aggregator may be configured to aggregate received vulnerability information associated with one or more respective security vulnerabilities into one or more respective unified vulnerability descriptions in accordance with the aggregation policy of a vulnerability information consumer in the policies store, and to distribute the one or more respective unified vulnerability descriptions through an output interface of the one or more output interfaces to the vulnerability information consumer.  A vulnerability information store may also be provided, and operatively coupled to the interface and to the aggregator, for storing the vulnerability information associated with the plurality of security vulnerabilities. The aggregator may in this case be further configured to, where an aggregation policy is added to or modified in the policies store, retrieve from the vulnerability information store vulnerability information associated with one or more respective security vulnerabilities in accordance with the new or modified aggregation policy, aggregate the retrieved vulnerability information into one or more respective unified vulnerability descriptions, and distribute the one or more respective unified vulnerability descriptions through an output interface of the one or more output interfaces to a vulnerability information consumer for which the new or modified aggregation policy specifies distribution parameters.  A method according to another aspect of the invention involves obtaining from a plurality of sources vulnerability information associated with a particular security vulnerability, and aggregating the vulnerability information obtained from the plurality of sources into a unified vulnerability definition associated with the security vulnerability.  The operation of aggregating may involve converting a format of vulnerability information received from each source into a format of the unified vulnerability definition.  In some embodiments, aggregating involves determining a portion of the unified vulnerability definition based on portions of the vulnerability information received from the plurality of sources.  The operation of determining may involve detecting a conflict between vulnerability information received from different sources of the plurality of sources, and resolving a detected conflict in accordance with at least one of: a set of one or more conflict rules, and a user input.  The vulnerability information received from each source may include respective source content arranged according to a respective source format, in which case the method may also involve converting the vulnerability information from each source format into a format of the unified vulnerability definition, and determining a portion of content in the unified vulnerability definition format based on corresponding portions of source content in the converted vulnerability information received from the plurality of sources.  The method may also include providing a representation of the unified vulnerability definition.  In some embodiments, obtaining involves at least one of: requesting vulnerability information, and receiving vulnerability information.  The method may also include an operation of distributing the unified vulnerability definition to one or more vulnerability information consumers.  The operation of obtaining may involve obtaining from the plurality of sources vulnerability information associated with a plurality of security vulnerabilities. In this case, aggregating may involve aggregating vulnerability information associated with one or more respective security vulnerabilities into one or more respective unified vulnerability descriptions in accordance with an aggregation policy that specifies distribution parameters for a vulnerability information consumer, and distributing may involve distributing the one or more respective unified vulnerability descriptions to the vulnerability information consumer.  The method may be embodied, for example, in a machine-readable medium.  A Graphical User Interface (GUI) according to a further aspect of the invention includes a representation of a unified vulnerability definition associated with a particular security vulnerability. The unified vulnerability definition includes aggregated vulnerability information determined on the basis of vulnerability information obtained from a plurality of sources.  The representation may include an indication of the plurality of sources from which vulnerability information was aggregated into the unified vulnerability definition.  Another aspect of the invention provides a machine-readable medium storing a data structure. The data structure includes a unified vulnerability definition associated with a particular security vulnerability, the unified vulnerability definition comprising aggregated vulnerability information determined on the basis of vulnerability information obtained from a plurality of sources.  Other aspects and features of the present invention will become apparent to those ordinarily skilled in the art upon review of the following description of specific illustrative embodiments thereof.   BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  Examples of embodiments of the invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS   FIG. 1 is a block diagram representation of general security concepts. The representation 10 shown in FIG. 1 illustrates an underlying security paradigm and derived concept based on the Common Criteria International Standard ISO/IEC 15408:1999 for Information Technology Security Evaluation.   FIG. 1 shows users or owners 12 , countermeasures 14 , vulnerabilities 16 , threat agents 18 , threats 22 , risks 20 , and assets 24 . Those skilled in the art will be familiar with the general security paradigm represented in FIG. 1 , which is therefore described only briefly herein.  Users/owners 12 may include, for example, owners or operators of a communication network, or other stakeholders having an interest in assets 24 .  Countermeasures 14 represent actions, such as upgrading an operating system or application software on a computer system asset for instance, which may be taken to reduce vulnerabilities 16 . A vulnerability 16 is a condition in an asset's operation which makes it susceptible to an attack, or possibly a failure. A security hole in operating system software is one illustrative example of a vulnerability.  Threat agents 18 are parties wishing to abuse or use assets 24 in a manner not intended by their users/owners 12 . A threat 22 is an indication, illustratively a probability, that an asset 24 may be harmed.  Assets 24 , in the example of a communication network, are components of the network and may be either physical or logical. Vulnerabilities 16 may exist for each type of asset 24 .  As shown in FIG. 1 , users/owners 12 value assets, wish to minimize risks 20 to the assets 24 , and may be aware of vulnerabilities 16 which lead to risks 20 to assets 24 . Vulnerabilities 16 may be reduced by the users/owners 12 by imposing countermeasures 14 . Inter-relations between other concepts shown in FIG. 1 will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a review thereof.  An adaptation of the concepts shown in FIG. 1 and how they relate to embodiments of the present invention are represented in FIG. 2 , which is a block diagram of a security decision model.  The users/owners 32 , threat agents 38 , threats 42 , risks 40 , assets 44 , and vulnerabilities 36 in FIG. 2 may be substantially the same as similarly labelled components of FIG. 1 , but are handled differently than in conventional techniques according to embodiments of the invention.  The vulnerability and network inventory database system 46 includes databases which store either information associated with vulnerabilities and assets or information from which vulnerability and asset information may be derived. In the example shown in FIG. 2 , the database system 46 includes a security knowledge database 47 which stores information associated with known vulnerabilities or security information which is converted or otherwise processed to generate vulnerability information. The network profile database 48 stores network inventory information. Information associated with assets in a network may be obtained from the network profile database 48 or derived from information which is obtained from the network profile database 48 .  Various implementations of the database system 46 will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, any of many different types of data storage device, such as disk drives and solid state memory devices, may be used to store the databases 47 , 48 . According to one particular embodiment of the invention, the databases 47 , 48 are stored at a computer system which also executes software implementing the security decision model 30 . It should be appreciated, however, that the database system 46 is intended to more generally represent a system through which vulnerability and asset information, or information from which these can be derived, is accessible. The databases 47 , 48 may thus be remote databases which are made accessible to the model 30 through appropriate interfaces and connections. The databases 47 , 48 may reside at a server in a Local Area Network (LAN), for example, in which case information is accessible through a network interface and LAN connections.  In operation, the security decision model 30 takes into account assets and vulnerabilities to determine a risk assessment. The risk assessment provides an indication of current network security state to the users/owners 32 .  The security decision model 30 may be implemented as shown in FIG. 3 , which is a block diagram of a security risk exposure management system according to an embodiment of the invention.  The architecture of the system 50 includes three main elements, namely the user interface 52 , the security module 54 , and the data system 56 . Any or all of these elements may be implemented partially or entirely in one or more computer systems. The user interface 52 might be provided through a display and input devices such as a keyboard, mouse, and/or a touchscreen, the security module 54 could be implemented primarily in software for storage in a memory of the computer system and execution by a processor, and the data system 56 could include local stores, interfaces to remote stores, or some combination thereof.  It should be appreciated that a system that uses vulnerability information may include further, fewer, or different elements, with different interconnections, than those explicitly shown in FIG. 3 . For example, a security risk management system might not include every element shown in FIG. 3 . A computer system or other equipment in which the system 50 is implemented may also include further elements used for other functions. A processor in a computer system would typically execute operating system software in addition to application software implementing security risk management functions for instance. Thus, FIG. 3 , as well as the contents of the other drawings, are intended solely for illustrative purposes, and not to limit the scope of the invention.  In the particular example system 50 shown in FIG. 3 , the user interface 52 includes a simulation interface 62 , a configuration interface 64 , a network map 66 and a report interface 68 . These user interface elements 62 , 64 , 66 , 68 interact with the security module 54 to accept user inputs and/or to provide outputs to users. A display, keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen represent examples of the types of input and output device through which information may be transferred between users and the security module 54 . These elements may also have associated software components for execution by a processor to process and transfer input and output information.  The simulation interface 62 , the configuration interface 64 , the network map 66 , and the report interface 68 are operatively coupled to the security module 54 . The form of connections through which these elements interact is dependent upon the particular type of equipment in which the system 50 is implemented. Internal bus structures, for example, are often used in computer systems, and thus interactions between the user interface 52 and its components with the security module 54 , as well as the data system 56 , may be enabled through internal connections, drivers, and interfaces between a processor and various input/output devices. However, other types of connection may also or instead be used.  The security module 54 includes an event manager 72 which is operatively coupled to the simulation interface 62 , to the configuration interface 64 , to one or more external systems, and to the data system 56 , a network model manager 74 which is operatively coupled to the network map 66 , to the event manager 72 , and to the data system 56 , a risk analyzer 76 which is operatively coupled to the configuration interface 64 , to the network model manager 74 , and to the data system 56 , and a report manager 78 which is operatively coupled to the risk analyzer 76 , to the report interface 68 , and to the data system 56 . These components of the security module 54 , like those of the user interface 52 , may be implemented in hardware, software for execution by a processor, or some combination thereof.  The data system 56 includes a vulnerability database 82 which is operatively coupled to a vulnerability information source interface 71 , to the event manager 72 , and to the risk analyzer 76 , an asset database 84 which is operatively coupled to the event manager 72 , to the network model manager 74 , and to the risk analyzer 76 , a security state database 86 which is operatively coupled to the risk analyzer 76 and to the report manager 78 , and a user interface database 88 which is operatively coupled to the user interface 52 . These databases may be stored in any of various types of storage device, such as solid state memory devices, disk drives, and other types of storage device which use fixed, movable, or possibly removable storage media. The data system 56 may include either data stores or interfaces through which remote data stores are accessible, as noted above in conjunction with FIG. 2 . Although shown separately in FIG. 3 , multiple databases 82 , 84 , 86 , 88 may be stored in one data store or memory device.  The vulnerability database 82 stores information associated with vulnerabilities. According to an embodiment of the invention, the vulnerability information source interface 71 provides vulnerability information to the vulnerability database 82 . In one implementation, the interface 71 receives aggregated vulnerability information from a remote aggregation system. An operator of the system 50 might subscribe to an “Aggregation Service”, to receive an aggregated feed from the aggregation system, for example. In this case, the interface 71 is effectively an output interface of an aggregator that obtains vulnerability information for particular vulnerabilities from multiple sources, applies a policy that may be user- or subscriber-specific to aggregate the vulnerability information into a unified vulnerability definition for each vulnerability, and stores the resultant unified vulnerability definition to the vulnerability database 82 . According to another embodiment, the interface 71 may itself obtain and aggregate vulnerability information from multiple sources.  The interface 71 is also operatively coupled to the user interface 52 to allow a user to review and/or possibly enter or modify vulnerability information. A user might also enter or modify aggregation policies through the user interface 52 . In order to avoid overly complicating the drawing, this is shown in FIG. 3 as a single connection between the interface 71 and the user interface 52 . It should be appreciated, however, that the interface 71 may be operatively coupled to multiple elements of the user interface 52 . In addition, an operative coupling between the interface 71 and the user interface 52 may be made through other components, such as the event manager 72 , which receives user inputs through the configuration interface 64 , where vulnerability information functions are provided by the security module 54 . An illustrative example of an apparatus that may be operatively coupled to or provided as the interface 71 is described in detail below with reference to FIG. 4 .  The asset database 84 stores information associated with assets. The vulnerability database 82 and the asset database 84 represent examples of the databases 47 , 48 ( FIG. 2 ).  The security state database 86 stores information associated with historical and/or current security risk status of a system. Information associated with the user interface 52 , such as different network views and placement of icons which have been configured by a user, is stored in the user interface database 88 .  Initial configuration of the system 50 for operation may involve storing vulnerability information and asset information in the databases 82 , 84 . Vulnerability and asset information may be manually entered by network operator personnel for example, and/or imported from an existing data store or other source. According to embodiments of the invention, vulnerability information that is stored in the database 82 includes aggregated vulnerability definitions generated by an aggregation system based on vulnerability information obtained from multiple sources. As noted above, the interface 71 may be operatively coupled to or incorporate an aggregation system. In one embodiment, the databases 82 , 84 are respectively populated through the interface 71 and the event manager 72 , although in some implementations each of the databases 82 , 84 may be accessible through other interfaces.  The event manager 72 processes incoming events, such as initial network configuration information or changes in the network topology or configuration. Information may be received by the event manager 72 from the simulation interface 62 , the configuration interface 64 , or one or more external systems such as a Network Management System (NMS) of a communication network.  Through the simulation interface 62 , a user may make trial or temporary changes in a network. This allows users to investigate the effects of changes, countermeasures for instance, before these changes are actually made in the network. A simulation event from the simulation interface 62 is preferably handled in a different manner than changes or updates received from other sources, so that temporary simulation changes do not affect vulnerabilities and assets which reflect actual network conditions. This may be accomplished, for example, by providing separate simulation databases to which temporary changes are applied. Simulation databases could be stored until explicitly deleted or cleared by a user, depending upon the amount of storage space available in the data system 56 , or automatically deleted when a user closes or exits the simulation interface 62 .  Information received by the event manager 72 , from the configuration interface 64 or external system(s), which affects actual network assets may be processed and written to the asset database 84 . The nature of the processing performed by the event manager 72 may be dependent on the type, format, and/or source of the information for instance.  Information entered by a user may already be formatted according to data structures used to store information in the databases 82 , 84 and can be written to the databases without significant processing. In the case of information received from vulnerability sources or other external systems, however, processing such as format and/or content conversions may be performed. E-mail updates including advisories of new vulnerabilities discovered by vendors of software used in a network, for example, may be received and processed by the interface 71 or a separate aggregation system in some embodiments and used to update the vulnerability database 82 . Network equipment or configuration updates received from an NMS or other systems might similarly involve processing by the event manager 72 .  The network model manager 74 captures a representation of the network being analyzed from the event manager 72 , the asset database 84 , or both, to present the network map 66 to a user. Assets and their relationships, as specified in the asset database 84 , are used by the network model manager 74 to build a model of the network. Events affecting a current network model may be passed from the event manager 72 to the network model manager 74 , or stored in the asset database 84 for access by the network model manager 74 . It should thus be appreciated that the network model manager 74 need not necessarily be physically connected to the event manager 72 . In some embodiments, the simulation interface 62 and the configuration interface 64 may be operatively coupled to the network model manager 74 to apply changes to a model.  The risk analyzer 76 performs risk analysis and calculations. Vulnerabilities affecting assets of a communication network are determined by the risk analyzer 76 , and risks in the communication network are then determined by analyzing the vulnerabilities and assets. Information associated with the vulnerabilities and assets is stored in the databases 82 , 84 as noted above, and accessed by the risk analyzer 76 .  Assets may include either or both of physical assets, illustratively equipment in the communication network, and logical assets such as software running on equipment in the communication network and information stored by equipment in the communication network.  Indications of risks determined by the risk analyzer 76 are provided to the network model manager 74 , so that a representation of the communication network and the determined risks can be provided to a user through the user interface 52 in the form of the network map 66 . The network map 66 thus includes both a representation of the network and detailed security risk information. Any of many different types and layouts of the network map 66 may be used to present results of a risk analysis. A graphical representation of a network in which assets and risks are shown using icons or images, text, or some combination thereof, may provide a most effective indication of a current security state of the network. In some embodiments, the format and layout of the network map 66 is in accordance with previously established user interface settings stored in the user interface database 88 .  The system 50 is in no way limited to any particular type of representation or output. For example, indications such as alarms or warnings, which may be provided locally through the user interface 52 or transmitted to a remote system such as a pager or an e-mail client for instance, are also contemplated.  The risk analyzer 76 may also provide security risk information to either or both of the report manager 78 and the security state database 86 . In FIG. 3 , the risk analyzer 76 is operatively coupled to both the report manager 78 and the security state database 86 . Outputs from the risk analyzer 76 may instead be provided to the security state database 86 through the report manager 78 . Another possible option would be to operatively couple the risk analyzer 76 and the report manager 78 to the security state database 86 . In this case, outputs from the risk analyzer 76 are provided to the security state database 86 , and information in the security state database 86 is then accessed by the report manager 78 to provide reports to a user through the report interface 68 .  The report interface 68 may also receive risk report selection inputs from a user for configuring reports of the risks determined by the risk analyzer 76 . Risk report selection inputs may control the content, format, or both, of reports generated by the report manager 78 . Responsive to risk report selection inputs received through the report interface 68 , the report manager 78 accesses security risk information, in the security state database 86 for instance, and generates a customized report for a user.  It should be noted that reports or other representations of vulnerability information may also or instead be provided to a user. The report interface 68 and the report manager 78 may interact with the interface 71 , the vulnerability database 82 , or both, to provide to a user a representation of the unified vulnerability definition for a particular vulnerability, for instance. The GUI shown in FIG. 6 and described in further detail below is an illustrative example of one such representation.  Risk analysis functions of the system 50 may be controlled by entering risk analysis configuration information through the configuration interface 64 . This may involve selecting specific types of risk calculations or parameters therefor, and/or selection of particular communication network features for analysis, for example. A user might be interested in assessing risk for a specific network asset, for a specific service provided by the network, or for a specific mission which is carried out using the communication network.  Once a service, mission, or other network feature is selected, the risk analyzer 76 determines vulnerabilities which affect the selected feature or assets in the network associated with the selected feature, illustratively by accessing the databases 82 , 84 . The risk analyzer 76 then determines risks to the selected feature by analyzing the vulnerabilities and assets. An indication of feature-specific risks may then be provided through the network model manager 74 , the report manager 78 , or both.  Details of risk analysis processes that may be performed on the basis of vulnerabilities for which information is stored in the vulnerability database 82 are provided in the three above-referenced patent applications. As embodiments of the present invention relate primarily to handling vulnerability information that may be used in these or other processes, the present application hereinafter concentrates primarily on the collection and processing of vulnerability information as opposed to its use in security risk analysis.   FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an apparatus implementing an embodiment of the invention. The apparatus 100 includes one or more communication interfaces 106 for communicating with vulnerability information sources 102 , 104 . A format migration module 108 includes format adapters 116 , 118 operatively coupled to the communication interface(s) 106 and to a vulnerability information store 119 . In a content aggregation module 110 , a content aggregator 126 is operatively coupled to the format adapters 116 , 118 through the vulnerability information store 119 , a conflict resolution module 122 is operatively coupled to the content aggregator 126 and to a conflict rules store 124 , and a policies store 125 , a conflict alert module 128 , and one or more output interface(s) 123 are also operatively coupled to the content aggregator 126 . A vulnerability database 112 is operatively coupled to the output interface(s) 123 , and represents one example of a system or subscriber to which unified vulnerability descriptions may be forwarded, also generally referred to herein as a vulnerability information consumer. A user interface 114 is operatively coupled to the vulnerability database 112 , to the content aggregator 126 , to the conflict alert module 128 , to the conflict resolution module 122 , to the conflict rules store 124 , and to the policies store 125 .  The present invention is in no way limited to the specific components and interconnections shown in FIG. 4 . Other embodiments may include further, fewer, and/or different components interconnected in a similar or different manner than shown. For example, the apparatus 100 may obtain vulnerability information from more than two sources 102 , 104 . In some embodiments, the user interface 114 allows other components to receive inputs from or provide outputs to a user.  The components of the apparatus 100 may be operatively coupled to each other through physical connections or through logical interconnections where any of the components are implemented using software for execution by one or more processing elements. For software-based implementations, different components may access data stored in common storage locations in a memory, for example, and may thus be considered to be coupled to each other through logical connections. The format adapters 116 , 118 and the content aggregator 126 are operatively coupled together via such a logical connection, through the vulnerability information store 119 .  From the foregoing, it will be apparent that many of the components of the apparatus 100 may be implemented using hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. Those skilled in the art will be familiar with devices that may be used in implementing the apparatus 100 , including microprocessors, microcontrollers, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs), and/or Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), for example.  In view of the many possible implementations of the components shown in FIG. 4 , these components are described herein primarily in terms of their function. Based on these functional descriptions, a skilled person would be enabled to implement embodiments of the invention in any of various ways.  The vulnerability information store 119 , the conflict rules store 124 , the policies store 125 , and the vulnerability database 112 , however, would generally be provided as data stores in a hardware component, specifically one or more memory devices. Solid state memory devices are common in some types of system, although the apparatus 100 may also or instead include memory devices for use with movable or even removable memory media.  The vulnerability information store 119 may be important, for example, where the apparatus 100 is used to implement an “Aggregation Provider”. In this variant, as shown in FIG. 4 , the outputs of the format adapters 116 , 118 store received and re-formatted vulnerability information to the vulnerability information store 119 . This allows the content aggregation module 110 to aggregate stored vulnerability information, to provide such features as supporting multiple aggregation policies stored in the policies store 125 for different vulnerability information consumers, and retro-actively aggregating existing vulnerability information when new policies are defined and/or existing policies are modified. These and other features are described in further detail below.  The conflict rules store 124 is used to store rules for resolving conflicts during content aggregation. Rule-based conflict resolution is also described below.  Where the apparatus 100 is implemented in the vulnerability information source interface 71 ( FIG. 3 ), the vulnerability database 112 might be the vulnerability database 82 . In other embodiments, the vulnerability database 112 is a remote component that is provided at a vulnerability data feed subscriber system, and not operatively coupled to the user interface 114 . Another possible implementation of a vulnerability database would be a local store from which unified vulnerability descriptions generated by the content aggregator 126 are retrieved and included in one or more vulnerability data feeds that are provided to subscribers through the output interface(s) 123 .  The user interface 114 will also generally be provided using physical devices such as a keyboard, a mouse, and a display. A touchscreen is one example of a device which can both receive inputs from a user and provide outputs to a user.  The communication interface(s) 106 receive vulnerability information from the sources 102 , 104 . The structure and function of the communication interface(s) 106 may be dependent at least to some extent upon the communication protocols used between the apparatus 100 and the sources 102 , 104 . For example, the communication interface(s) 106 may include a network interface for communicating with one or more remote vulnerability information sources through a communication network, a local interface for accessing previously received vulnerability information in a data store, or multiple types of interface. In one embodiment, respective communication interfaces 106 are provided to support different communication protocols or communications with groups of one or more sources 102 , 104 .  Vulnerability information transfer through the communication interface(s) 106 may involve either or both of “pull” and “push” operations. In a pull scheme, vulnerability sources are polled by sending requests or other messages through the communication interface(s) 106 . These messages cause the vulnerability sources 102 , 104 to return vulnerability information to the apparatus 100 . Vulnerability information may also or instead be pushed to the apparatus 100 by one or more of the sources 102 , 104 automatically, at periodic intervals for instance. The apparatus 100 may thus receive vulnerability information with or without having first transmitted some form of request.  References herein to an interface for receiving vulnerability information should be interpreted accordingly, to include one or more interfaces for communicating directly or indirectly, through a memory as noted above for instance, with vulnerability information sources to allow vulnerability information to be obtained by an aggregator.  The format migration module 108 and the content aggregation module 110 of the apparatus 100 represent one illustrative example of an aggregator according to an embodiment of the invention.  The format migration module 108 converts received vulnerability information from one or more source formats into a format of a unified vulnerability definition. In the example shown, format adapters 116 , 118 , which are specific to respective vulnerability information sources 102 , 104 , are provided. Each format adapter 116 , 118 converts between the source format of one or more vulnerability information sources and the unified vulnerability definition format.  In terms of implementation, a format adapter 116 , 118 may be designed as a plugin or other software code, to facilitate the addition of new vulnerability information sources as they appear over time. This would also facilitate format adapter changes or updates whenever a source changes the format in which it provides vulnerability information.  For ease of description, format conversion functions will be described below in detail primarily with reference to source-specific format adapters. It should be appreciated, however, that source-specific format adapters 116 , 118 are illustrative of one embodiment of the invention. A format migration module may implement multiple-format conversion functions in other ways, without necessarily providing distinct source- or format-specific functional components.  As noted above, the format in which vulnerability information is provided may vary between different sources. One source may provide vulnerability information in a first format including a vulnerability “name”, a free-form textual vulnerability “description”, a listing of “affected platforms”, and an “impact”, whereas another source may provide vulnerability information in a second format including a vulnerability “name”, a listing of “affected systems”, an “effect”, and a free-form textual vulnerability “description”. Such source formats might be indicated using labels, tags, or other delineators in data feeds generated by each source, for example.  Each format adapter 116 , 118 is operable to convert a respective source format into a unified vulnerability definition format. Format adapters may be developed by vulnerability sources based on their own source formats and a unified format specification that might be distributed by an aggregator manufacturer or vendor, for example. Vulnerability sources may also or instead distribute source format specifications to allow aggregator vendors or third parties to develop format adapters. Regardless of the format adapter development mechanism(s), portions or fields of the unified format can be mapped to portions or fields of source formats provided both the unified format and the source formats are known.  Consider a simple example of a unified format including a vulnerability “name”, “platforms affected”, an “impact”, and a “description”. These fields might be delineated in a data stream or data store by labels or tags, as noted above. A format adapter for the first format described above might map the first format “name” to the unified format “name”, the first format free-form textual vulnerability “description” to the unified format “description”, the first format “affected platforms” to the unified format “platforms affected”, and the first format “impact” to the second format “impact”.  Conversion of vulnerability information from the first format to the unified format may involve updating or overwriting labels or tags in a data stream or data store, for example. Thus, a format adapter 116 , 118 might update labels or tags as it passes a received data stream to the vulnerability information store 119 , store portions of vulnerability information from a received data stream into particular fields of a data structure in the vulnerability information store 119 , or modify labels or tags in the vulnerability information store 119 after a received data stream has been stored.  Conversion of vulnerability information from the second format to the unified format may be accomplished in a similar manner, by mapping the second format “name” to the unified format “name”, the second format “affected systems” to the unified format “platforms affected”, the second format “effect” to the unified format “impact”, and the second format “description” to the unified format “description”.  The above examples of a first format, a second format, and a unified format have been provided solely for the purposes of illustration. Other source/unified formats are also contemplated. The particular format mapping and conversion functions will vary from those described above for different source/unified formats. For instance, source and unified formats might not necessarily completely overlap. Sources may provide different vulnerability information fields in their respective source formats. A source format may include fields that are not part of the unified format, not include all of the fields that are part of the unified format, or have some fields that have not been populated. Further variation between source formats and between source formats and a unified format are also possible without departing from the scope of the present invention.  In the apparatus 100 , once vulnerability information has been translated into the appropriate format, which might not be necessary in all embodiments, and stored in the vulnerability information store 119 , it is accessed by the content aggregation module 110 . A primary purpose of the content aggregation module 110 , and in particular the content aggregator 126 , is to merge the actual source content of vulnerability information originating from different sources 102 , 104 into a single, consistent, unified vulnerability definition. The unified vulnerability definition includes at least one portion of content determined on the basis of corresponding portions of source content received from multiple sources.  For numeric fields such as CVSS scores, for example, the content aggregator 126 may aggregate CVSS scores from multiple sources into a single score by determining the mean, maximum, and/or some other value based on the multiple source scores. Textual fields such as a description may be combined by concatenating text from multiple sources into a single text field, possibly with an identifier of each source from which particular text originated, or by selecting text from one particular preferred source. Preferred sources may be predetermined or configured by a user through the user interface 114 , for example.  Textual fields represent one type of field for which different sources may provide conflicting vulnerability information, or more generally vulnerability information that may be more difficult to automatically aggregate. In these situations, the content aggregator 126 may trigger the conflict resolution module 122 to resolve the inconsistencies originating from different data sources. One embodiment of the conflict resolution module 122 includes a set of static conflict rules, represented in FIG. 4 as the conflict rules store 124 . For example, a conflict rule may be configured by an operator through the user interface 114 to apply highest confidence to particular sources, accepting information from those sources over others. Preferred source rules may also be field-specific, where particular sources are preferred for certain types of vulnerability information.  In some cases, automated rules might not completely resolve all conflicts, and an option to allow human intervention may be provided. Where the intervention of a human operator is needed to solve a conflict or to populate a specific information field for instance, the content aggregator 126 may cause the conflict alert module 128 to issue an alert. An alert could be stored into a dedicated database for subsequent reporting through the user interface 114 and manual analysis, or provided as a user prompt through the user interface 114 for instance.  The content aggregator 126 outputs to the output interface(s) 123 a unified vulnerability definition in a unified format, including content that is based on vulnerability information received from multiple different sources. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4 , the unified vulnerability description is provided to the vulnerability database 112 through the output interface(s) 123 , such that a unified vulnerability definition for a particular vulnerability may be accessed by a user through the user interface 114 and a browsing application, for example. The vulnerability database 112 may also or instead be accessed by other components such as a security risk analysis system.  The output interface(s) 123 receive unified vulnerability definitions from the content aggregator 126 and may distribute those unified vulnerability descriptions to one or more vulnerability information consumers. Like the communication interface(s) 106 , the structure and function of the output interface(s) 123 may be dependent at least to some extent upon the communication protocols used between the apparatus 100 and the consumers to which unified vulnerability descriptions are provided. For example, the output interface(s) 123 might include a local interface where the apparatus 100 is implemented to feed a local vulnerability database, a network interface for communicating with one or more remote consumers, or multiple types of interface. In one embodiment, respective output interfaces 123 are provided to support different communication protocols or communications with respective groups of one or more vulnerability information consumers.  In some cases, where a source subscription mechanism is available, vulnerability information may be obtained via a push or notification mechanism. This allows the aggregator, the vulnerability database 112 , and/or any other consumers served by the apparatus 100 to be updated when a new vulnerability appears, information associated with an existing vulnerability is modified, or a new source becomes available for instance. An on-demand pull sub-component may also or instead be provided to allow receiving of an instantaneous view of the current state associated with one or more vulnerability information sources. This function may be directly available through the user interface 114 or a remote consumer system, such as while a user is browsing vulnerability definitions, or pre-configured to be triggered on a scheduled basis, for example.  With respect to updating a unified vulnerability definition, it should be appreciated that vulnerability information may be received from sources at different times. The apparatus 100 might initially receive information associated with a particular vulnerability from only the source 102 . The source 104 might not at that time have information associated with the vulnerability. In this case, the vulnerability information store 119 and a resultant unified vulnerability definition for that vulnerability may include information from only the source 102 . When information associated with the same vulnerability is subsequently received from the source 104 , after the vulnerability has been discovered and analyzed by an entity providing the source for instance, the vulnerability information store 119 and the unified definition are updated. The updated unified definition then includes information that was determined on the basis of vulnerability information that was received from different sources, albeit at different times.  The foregoing description of FIG. 4 relates primarily to aggregating vulnerability information from multiple sources into a unified vulnerability definition for one vulnerability. However, it should be appreciated that the apparatus 100 may, and likely would, perform aggregation functions for multiple security vulnerabilities. In some embodiments, the apparatus 100 is used to provide a vulnerability advisory or data feed service in which unified vulnerability descriptions associated with multiple vulnerabilities are distributed to vulnerability information consumers. The common format in which each unified vulnerability definition is provided allows a consumer to directly load a vulnerability database in a risk analysis system, for example, or to at least define a standard set of processing functions to be applied to its vulnerability information feed.  A vulnerability information consumer then benefits from having vulnerability information from multiple sources, in the form of unified vulnerability definitions that aggregate information from multiple sources, without having to support various formats in which different types of vulnerability information might be provided by those sources.  Each vulnerability information consumer may have different vulnerability information requirements. The policies store 125 provides a mechanism for managing consumer-specific policies. These policies may specify such vulnerability information distribution parameters as the frequency at which vulnerability definitions are to be transmitted to each consumer, the particular vulnerabilities for which unified vulnerability definitions are to be included in each consumer's data feed, etc. Each policy in the policies store 125 thus specifies a set of one or more distribution parameters for a particular vulnerability information consumer.  The unified vulnerability definitions to be sent to the consumers may be stored in separate per-consumer data stores in the database 112 or another database, or pushed in an aggregated data feed from the apparatus 100 to the consumers via the output interface(s) 123 .  The vulnerability information store 119 may also provide advantages in terms of managing different consumer vulnerability information requirements. Consider, for example, the addition of a new client to a vulnerability data feed service provided by the apparatus 100 . If the new client wishes to receive an aggregated feed of all new vulnerabilities, it is likely that the client would also wish to receive vulnerability information for all current vulnerabilities. In this case, the content aggregator 126 may detect the policy for the new client in the policy store 125 or otherwise be instructed or triggered to prepare and send a data feed to the new customer. The content aggregator 126 then retrieves existing vulnerability information from the store 119 and aggregates the vulnerability information “retro-actively”.  Similar operations may be performed when a customer's profile is changed in the profiles store 125 . Suppose an information system runs many different software applications, with only some being identified as “mission critical”. An Instant Message (IM) server, for example, might be a low priority and therefore is not given significant consideration in a security risk analysis process. The IM server might be reachable only through a single router that is not used for anything else, for instance. In this case, vulnerabilities to the router or the IM server would basically be ignored, and as such an owner or manager of the information system would not likely require vulnerability information associated with those vulnerabilities in its data feed from the apparatus 100 .  However, a new initiative or other development may affect the importance of some previously non-critical software applications of the information system. For example, if Instant Messaging were critical to a new automation initiative, then the formerly unimportant router becomes critical. Both new and past vulnerabilities to the router also become important. Responsive to an update of the profile for the customer in the profile store 125 or some other command or trigger, the content aggregator 126 retrieves existing vulnerability information from the store 119 and generates unified vulnerability descriptions for the newly important vulnerabilities. In this case, the content aggregator 126 might just repeat the whole aggregation process for all vulnerabilities required by the customer. The content aggregator 126 thereafter also includes unified vulnerability descriptions for the now important vulnerabilities in the customer's data feed.   FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating a vulnerability information management method. The method 130 involves obtaining vulnerability information associated with a security vulnerability from multiple sources at 132 and aggregating the vulnerability information into a unified vulnerability definition associated with the security vulnerability at 134 .  The operation at 132 involves receiving vulnerability information from the sources, and may also involve requesting the vulnerability information from one or more of the sources.  Vulnerability information aggregation at 134 may involve format conversion, content conversion, or both. In some embodiments, aggregation also involves detecting conflicts between vulnerability information received from different sources, and resolving those conflicts in accordance with one or more conflict rules and/or a user input.  It should be appreciated that the method 130 is intended as one example of a method according to an embodiment of the invention. Other embodiments may involve further, fewer, or different operations, which may be performed in a similar or different order and manner than explicitly shown and described. Some variations of the method 130 and examples of additional or different operations that may be performed have been described herein, and others may be or become apparent to those skilled in the art.  For example, the unified definition associated with a vulnerability may be updated based on new or updated vulnerability information, as represented by the dashed line in FIG. 5 . In one embodiment, updates may be triggered through a GUI in which a representation of the unified vulnerability definition is provided. A vulnerability information aggregator component may be integrated or otherwise operable in conjunction with a security management application, which also provides a UI component enabling a user to browse among a set of unified vulnerability definitions. A component in charge of polling vulnerability information sources may retrieve current information from those sources so that unified definitions, and thus a user's view of vulnerabilities, are kept in synchronization with vulnerability information maintained by the sources.  Although described above primarily in the context of an example apparatus and method, the present invention may be implemented or supported in other forms, including a displayed representation in a GUI or a data structure or instructions stored on a machine-readable medium, for example. A GUI and a data structure are described in further detail below with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7 , respectively.   FIG. 6 is a block of a GUI that provides a representation of a unified vulnerability definition. In FIG. 6 , the representation is in the form of a window 140 , with common graphical elements such as a title bar, a directory tree, and minimize, maximize, and close window functional elements 142 , 144 , 146 .  The window 140 provides a graphical representation 154 of a unified vulnerability definition associated with the security vulnerability. The representation 154 includes a graphical element 152 that identifies a particular security vulnerability and other graphical elements that similarly provide a representation of further vulnerability information in the unified vulnerability definition. As noted above, the unified vulnerability definition includes aggregated vulnerability information that was obtained from a plurality of sources. An indication of the sources from which vulnerability information was aggregated into the unified vulnerability definition are provided in the field labelled “Reference Ids”.  Several possible GUI-related features are embodied in the window 140 . Browsing between unified definitions for different vulnerabilities may be facilitated by the directory tree at the left hand side of the window 140 . It will also be apparent that at least some fields of a unified vulnerability definition may be selected or otherwise entered by a user. Information in the “Type”, “Severity”, “Vendor confidence”, and “Attacker expertise” fields is selectable from pull-down menus, and information for at least some other fields such as the “Description” and “Solution” fields may be editable by clicking in those fields using a mouse pointer, for example. Manual information entry may be useful to allow a user to resolve a conflict or to populate fields for which vulnerability information was not available from any sources.  Both textual and numeric fields are illustrated in FIG. 6 . Each of the Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Magnitude impacts is expressed numerically, whereas the “Description”, “Solution”, and other fields include text. These types of information may be aggregated in different ways, as described above.  Functional graphical elements may also be provided. The buttons 162 provide a function to add or remove information for the corresponding fields by launching a user interface, such as a new window dialog-box, allowing access to a selection of options for the corresponding fields. The button 164 may be selected to view any assets associated with a managed system that are affected and/or exploited by the displayed vulnerability. As will be apparent, the save button 166 allows a user save any changes made in the window 140 to a vulnerability database or store, and the cancel button 168 allows a user to cancel any changes made in the window 140 without saving those changes.  It should be appreciated that the invention is in no way limited to the particular representation, layout, fields, or types of information shown in FIG. 6 . For example, a vulnerability “Name” might be in some other form than a number, such as a word or phrase that would have a meaning to a user, some fields may include “active” content such as hyperlinks, and the information to be presented in a GUI and/or characteristics of the GUI itself may be predefined or possibly configurable. In the case of a hyperlink or other active content, an aggregator might display the hyperlink and a capture of information provided at that hyperlink at a certain time, and possibly also an indication of the time at which the information was captured. The user is then able to view the information and also obtain current information from the hyperlink, if desired.   FIG. 7 is a block diagram of an example unified vulnerability definition data structure. The data structure 170 includes an identifier 172 of a security vulnerability, and \n"

It includes numerous security-hacker tools for information gathering, vulnerability analysis, wireless attacks, web applications, exploitation tools, stress testing, forensic tools, sniffing and spoofing, password cracking, reverse engineering, hardware hacking and much more.  We’ve previously explored the Top 20 OSINT Tools available, and today we’ll go through the list of top-used Kali Linux software. Let’s begin!   The 25 most popular Kali Linux tools  For ease of reference, we’ll divide the most-used software of Kali Linux into five distinct categories: information gathering, vulnerability scanning, wireless analysis tools, password crackers, exploitation tools and stress testing.  1. Nmap  Nmap is the world’s most famous network mapper tool. It allows you to discover active hosts within any network, and acquire other information (such as open ports) relevant to penetration testing.  Main features:   Host discovery: useful for identifying hosts in any network  Port scanning: lets you enumerate open ports on the local or remote host  OS detection: useful for fetching operating system and hardware information about any connected device  App version detection: allows you to determine application name and version number  Scriptable interaction: extends Nmap default capabilities by using Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)   [securitytrails@kali root]$ nmap --help\n",
      "Usage: nmap [Scan Type(s)] [Options] {target specification}\n",
      "TARGET SPECIFICATION:\n",
      "Can pass hostnames, IP addresses, networks, etc.\n",
      "Ex: scanme.nmap.org, microsoft.com/24, 192.168.0.1; 10.0.0-255.1-254\n",
      "-iL <inputfilename>: Input from list of hosts/networks\n",
      "-iR <num hosts>: Choose random targets\n",
      "--exclude <host1[,host2][,host3],...>: Exclude hosts/networks\n",
      "--excludefile <exclude_file>: Exclude list from file\n",
      "HOST DISCOVERY:\n",
      "-sL: List Scan - simply list targets to scan\n",
      "-sn: Ping Scan - disable port scan\n",
      "-Pn: Treat all hosts as online -- skip host discovery\n",
      "-PS/PA/PU/PY[portlist]: TCP SYN/ACK, UDP or SCTP discovery to given ports\n",
      "-PE/PP/PM: ICMP echo, timestamp, and netmask request discovery probes\n",
      "-PO[protocol list]: IP Protocol Ping\n",
      "-n/-R: Never do DNS resolution/Always resolve [default: sometimes]\n",
      "--dns-servers <serv1[,serv2],...>: Specify custom DNS servers\n",
      "--system-dns: Use OS's DNS resolver\n",
      "--traceroute: Trace hop path to each host  Ready to unleash the power of Nmap? Check out our list of Top 15 Nmap Commands .  2. Netcat  Netcat is a network exploration application that is not only popular among those in the security industry, but also in the network and system administration fields.  While it’s primarily used for outbound/inbound network checking and port exploration, it’s also valuable when used in conjunction with programming languages like Perl or C, or with bash scripts.  Netcat’s main features include:   TCP and UDP port analysis  Inbound and outbound network sniffing  Reverse and forward DNS analysis  Scan local and remote ports  Fully integrated with terminal standard input  UDP and TCP tunnelling mode   3. Unicornscan  Licensed under the GPL license, Unicornscan is one of the best infosec tools used for information gathering and data correlation. It offers advanced asynchronous TCP and UDP scanning features along with very useful network discovery patterns that will help you to find remote hosts. It can also reveal details about the software running by each one of them.  Main features include:   TCP asynchronous scan  Asynchronous UDP scan  Asynchronous TCP banner detection  OS, application and system service detection  Ability to use custom data sets  Support for SQL relational output   4. Fierce  Fierce is a great tool for network mapping and port scanning . It can be used to discover non-contiguous IP space and hostnames across networks.  It’s similar to Nmap and Unicornscan, but unlike those, Fierce is mostly used for specific corporate networks.  Once the penetration tester has defined the target network, Fierce will run several tests against the selected domains to retrieve valuable information that can be used for later analysis and exploitation.  Its features include:   Ability to change DNS server for reverse lookups  Internal and external IP ranges scanning  IP range and entire Class C scanning  Logs capabilities into a system file  Name Servers discovery and Zone Transfer attack  Brute force capabilities using built-in or custom text list   5. OpenVAS  OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) was developed by part of the team responsible for the famous Nessus vulnerability scanner. Licensed under the GLP license, it’s free software that anyone can use to explore local or remote network vulnerabilities.  This security tool allows you to write and integrate your own security plugins to the OpenVAS platform — even though the current engine comes with more than 50k NVTs (Network Vulnerability Tests) that can literally scan anything you imagine in terms of security vulnerabilities.  Main features:   Simultaneous host discovery  Network mapper and port scanner  Support for OpenVAS Transfer Protocol  Fully integrated with SQL Databases like SQLite  Scheduled daily or weekly scans  Exports results into XML, HTML, LateX file formats  Ability to stop, pause and resume scans  Full support for Linux and Windows    6. Nikto  Written in Perl and included in Kali Linux, Nikto iworks as a complement to OpenVAS \n",

Methods for assessing the disaster vulnerability of communities through quantitative indices are established in research and practice. They are typically used to identify which cities or other spatial units are most susceptible to losses from storms, floods, and other hazards; however, their utility for taking action to reduce vulnerability has been found to be limited. In contrast, the method developed here quantifies vulnerability profiles for purposes of identifying places that are similarly vulnerable. Such an approach can facilitate sharing of knowledge, resources, and successful practices that are relevant to a particular community’s circumstances. The approach is demonstrated in a preliminary application to coastal communities in British Columbia, Canada. Keywords Hazards Disasters Vulnerability Resilience Quantitative methods Indicators 1 Introduction The concept of differential vulnerability to natural hazards—that groups within society are not equally at risk from the adverse effects of hazard events but are, rather, differently predisposed to harm—is well established in both research and practice. Predisaster conditions such as poverty, chronic illness, and poor quality housing are known to make some social groups more likely to suffer losses when disasters strike and to have more difficulty in recovering. The concept of vulnerability can also be extended to places. In addition to social, demographic, and economic aspects, some communities face high natural hazard risk due to their location, for example, in seismic zones or floodplains. Coastal cities are especially vulnerable to storm surge and flooding, and these hazards are expected to be exacerbated by subsidence and sea-level rise. While case studies are essential for providing insights into the causes, processes, and contexts of vulnerability, comparative studies are needed to identify patterns and support prioritization (National Research Council 2006 ). For example, an assessment of 136 coastal cities around the world conducted by Hallegatte et al. ( 2013 ) has found that not only are total potential flood losses increasing rapidly, but expected economic losses are concentrated in only a few, particularly vulnerable cities. Many other studies, as reviewed below, have utilized indicator-based approaches to identify “hotspots” of vulnerability. Efforts are also emerging to quantify the related concept of disaster resilience (e.g., Bruneau et al. 2003 ; Cutter et al. 2008 ), which has been defined as “the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events” (National Research Council 2012 , p. 1). Such systematic assessments are needed to inform public policy (e.g., Mustafa et al. 2011 ; National Research Council 2012 ). This paper proposes a new approach to using vulnerability indicators to bridge knowledge and practice in reducing disaster risk and fostering disaster resilience. Rather than identifying places that may be most vulnerable, the approach is intended to identify places that are similarly vulnerable, in order to facilitate building networks for disaster resilience. This objective is motivated by the recognition that learning is important for resilience, for example, learning lessons from other communities’ experiences of disasters and their actions to reduce disaster vulnerability. Finding cases and lessons that are the most relevant, however, is difficult. The approach proposed here can provide systematic guidance to help communities learn from places that face similar challenges, rather than simply drawing on sources that are most recent, familiar, or available. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 , the literature on quantitative indicators of disaster vulnerability of communities is first reviewed, focusing on methodological approaches, applications, and critiques. Emphasis is placed on vulnerability of coastal communities. A similarity-based approach is then proposed in Sect. 3 , which is adapted from well-established methods in other fields of application. Section 4 demonstrates the concept in a prototype application to coastal communities in British Columbia, Canada. Section 5 elaborates on the idea of implementing vulnerability indicators to develop resilience networks and concludes with a discussion of opportunities, limitations, and future research needs. 2 Vulnerability and risk indicators Numerous approaches have been developed for quantifying indicators of vulnerability to environmental change, and vulnerability indicators have been applied around the world. More recently, as discussed below, indicator approaches have extended beyond vulnerability to the concept of resilience. Of particular relevance here are those that focus on the community scale (e.g., cities rather than households or nations), on vulnerability to natural hazards (e.g., storms rather than climate change generally), and on socioeconomic vulnerability and its intersection with biophysical dimensions (e.g., human communities rather than ecosystems). The following review emphasizes indicator approaches that have been developed for coastal communities and coastal hazards, based on the premise that some key aspects of vulnerability are specific to coastal conditions and should be explicitly acknowledged. It further emphasizes recent developments, including emerging critiques and gaps, and pays particular attention to the potential uses of vulnerability indicators. The Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) developed by Cutter et al. ( 2003 ) represents one of the major approaches for quantifying community vulnerability to hazards. Based on a hazards-of-place model, it conceptualizes overall vulnerability as deriving from the interaction between biophysical and social vulnerabilities. Focusing on the latter, the SoVI framework provides an approach for quantitatively comparing the relative social vulnerability of places. The original SoVI framework was applied to all counties comprising the USA and included 42 variables that characterized social, demographic, economic, and built environment attributes of communities. Importantly, variable selection was informed by an extensive theoretical and empirical literature on hazards and disaster vulnerability. The 42 variables, which were implemented largely with census data, were reduced to 11 factors by using a statistical approach that accounts for correlation between variables. These factors were then combined in an unweighted index that quantified the relative degree of social vulnerability for each county. Results identify the most vulnerable communities in the USA. Indicator-type approaches have more recently been developed and applied around the world, including several that specifically address the vulnerability of coastal communities. A number of vulnerability indices integrate elements of social vulnerability with physical vulnerability in the context of specific coastal hazards, for example, hurricanes and storm surge (Rygel et al. 2006 ; Bjarnadottir et al. 2011 ), tsunamis (Wood et al. 2010 ), marine oil spills (Santos et al. 2013 ), coastal erosion (McLaughlin and Cooper 2010 ), loss of coastal wetlands due to urbanization (Huang et al. 2012 ), and coastal flooding and sea-level rise (Wu et al. 2002 ; Balica et al. 2012 ; Felsenstein and Lichter 2014 ). Methodologically, vulnerability indicators have been refined through greater attention to issues of spatial scale, with limited attention to multi-scalar interactions. Some studies have developed vulnerability indicators at neighborhood or smaller spatial scales, such as census blocks (e.g., Wood et al. 2010 ; Oulahen et al. 2015 ). Felsenstein and Lichter ( 2014 ) aggregated household-level data to the community level, which enabled an analysis of intracommunity differentials across subpopulations in the hazard zones. McLaughlin and Cooper ( 2010 ) explored coastal vulnerability indices at national, local, and site levels; they noted that index development should consider spatial scales appropriate to the hazard, to data availability, and to management decisions. Innovations have also been made in considering dynamics, or changes over time, in vulnerability indicator analysis. Using SoVI, Cutter and Finch ( 2008 ) provided a retrospective assessment of how social vulnerability patterns across the USA have changed between 1960 and 2000. Other coastal vulnerability studies have prospectively analyzed how vulnerability patterns may change in future, particularly in the context of hazard shifts related to climate change (Bjarnadottir et al. 2011 ; Balica et al. 2012 ). An important advance has been the incorporation of variables that describe institutional dimensions of places that relate, for example, to governance arrangements and risk management. The attention to institutional dimensions reflects growing attention to indicators of resilience (for a recent review, see National Research Council 2012 ). (As noted in Sect. 1 above, resilience overlaps conceptually with but is not the same as vulnerability.) Cutter et al. ( 2008 ) propose a disaster resilience of place (DROP) model that would include ecological, social, economic, institutional, infrastructure, and community competence indicators. Institutional variables could include availability of hazard mitigation plans, emergency services, and zoning and building standards that reduce risk. Peacock ( 2010 ) developed a Community Disaster Resilience Index that is similarly framed around five forms of capital (natural, physical, human, social, and financial) but explicitly referenced to the phases of the disaster cycle (mitigation, preparedness, response, recovery). This framework allows capturing of institutional variables such as building inspectors or percent of population covered by zoning regulations. Although applied to US Gulf Coast counties, it is not specific to coastal hazards. Among coastal vulnerability or resilience indicator studies, Balica et al. ( 2012 ) considered flood hazard maps, flood protection, and uncontrolled planning zones. In adapting vulnerability indicator approaches to different contexts, different types of data sources have been explored. Holand and Lujala ( 2013 ) discuss conceptual applicability, data availability, and data appropriateness in the process of adapting SoVI to other countries and contexts. In many cases, particularly where statistical data are unavailable, unreliable, or incomplete, processes of data collection have been more participatory. Experts and local stakeholders have been engaged to identify indicators, to design indices, to incorporate local knowledge of hazard and vulnerability conditions, to provide weights for indicators, and to ensure appropriateness to local contexts (e.g., Huang et al. 2012 ; Kienberger 2012 ; Orencio and Fujii 2012 ; Torresan et al. 2012 ). After developing a SoVI-type index using statistical data, Oulahen et al. ( 2015 ) engaged municipal government staff in several Canadian municipalities to validate, weight, and revise it. Despite the numerous applications and methodological innovations, however, the basic motivation for developing vulnerability indicators has remained remarkably consistent. Whether explicitly or implicitly, nearly all such studies have sought to assess the relative vulnerability of places (an exception is Burton ( 2010 ), which sought to improve hurricane loss models). Places might be mapped according to a vulnerability score or ranked. A common objective is to identify areas of especially high vulnerability in order to support allocating resources and making decisions, plans, and policies to reduce this vulnerability. For example, Wood et al. ( 2010 ) sought to identify hotspots of social vulnerability to help emergency managers in disaster risk reduction planning. Chakraborty et al. ( 2005 ) identified patterns of social vulnerability to indicate where special assistance would be needed in evacuation. Balica et al. ( 2012 ) suggest that indicators can be used to help explore changing vulnerability and adaptation options for climate change. Vulnerability indicators, if appropriately formulated and tracked over time, can in principle be used to monitor progress toward risk reduction and resilience goals (National Research Council 2012 ). While vulnerability indicators have been widely applied, the limitations of the approach have also been recognized (e.g., Fekete 2012 ). Conceptually, vulnerability is a complex phenomenon involving numerous factors, many of which can only be imperfectly suggested by quantifiable variables. Moreover, vulnerability arises from the interaction of factors, and the interaction occurs in a particular context. No single composite index can be expected to capture such complexity thoroughly, and some analysts have argued for the use of disaggregated indicators rather than composite indices (e.g., Adger et al. 2004 ). Data issues are numerous, as alluded to above. Methodological issues include how to select and weight indicators (e.g., Jones and Andrey 2007 , Tate 2012 ). Furthermore, vulnerability indicators are very difficult to validate (Cutter and Finch 2008 ). Other critiques pertain to the usability of vulnerability indicators. Some analysts suggest that despite their intent, vulnerability analysis has made few tangible contributions to public policy (Mustafa et al. 2011 ). Communicating large quantities of data to stakeholders is challenging, and potential users may not readily accept indices that do not correspond to their local knowledge; further, they may prefer to develop combinations of individual indicators that are more locally pertinent than a composite index (Oulahen et al. 2015 ). Involving potential users can be important for increasing the likelihood that vulnerability indicators will be used in practice. Indeed, the design of vulnerability indicators should be driven by their intended use, thus implying the need for a multiplicity of approaches (Birkmann et al. 2013 ). Here, we propose that vulnerability indicators can be valuable for a new purpose: Rather than identifying the most vulnerable places, they can be used to match places that are similarly vulnerable. We argue that if applied for this purpose, vulnerability indicators can be effective in facilitating knowledge transfer, learning, and resource sharing for reducing vulnerability and risk. Such an approach should enable comparison of communities in terms of different dimensions of vulnerability; hence, disaggregated similarity indicators are needed, along with overall (composite) measures. While not necessarily requiring new conceptual frameworks, this utilization demands a different methodological approach, as described and demonstrated below. 3 A similarity-based approach 3.1 Similarity index methods Methods for quantifying similarity, such as the Jaccard index or the Pearson correlation coefficient, are well established in many fields. Similarity indices are applied in ecology, for example, to assess similarity between ecological communities in terms of their species composition (e.g., Hastings et al. 2012 ), in genetics to characterize similarity between gene profiles (e.g., Deshpande et al. 2013 ), and in psychology to measure similarity between personality profiles (e.g., Furr and Wood 2013 ). In some cases, the presence or absence of common features is of interest, while in others, the degree of commonality is important and can be assessed by various measures of distance. In adapting such measures for purposes of comparing communities’ vulnerability profiles, it is important to consider several practical requirements. The similarity measure should be able to handle different types of data. Some types of indicators may be binary, such as whether or not a community has adopted a bylaw that regulates development on floodplains. Other indicators could be nominal or ordinal categorical variables (e.g., measured as high/medium/low), or continuous (e.g., measured as percent of population). It is also important for the similarity measure to be able to handle different amounts and types of data that might be available for different communities. It should be possible to implement the similarity measure even in cases where some data are missing. Furthermore, the measure should allow for comparisons along individual or subgroups of vulnerability indicators, such as size of built environment or social vulnerability, in addition to overall vulnerability profile. 3.2 Hazard Vulnerability Similarity Index Based on these considerations, we propose a similarity measure that is adapted from Gower’s general similarity coefficient S  Gower , which was originally proposed by Gower ( 1971 ) and is widely used for mixed data types (Gan et al. 2007 ). Here, the Hazard Vulnerability Similarity Index (HVSI) is defined as: $${\\text{HVSI}}(\\varvec{x},\\varvec{y}) = {{\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{n} {w(x_{k} ,y_{k} )\\;s(x_{k} ,y_{k} )} } \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{n} {w(x_{k} ,y_{k} )\\;s(x_{k} ,y_{k} )} } {\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{n} {w(x_{k} ,y_{k} )} }}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} {\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{n} {w(x_{k} ,y_{k} )} }}$$  (1) where x and y describe two communities, respectively, and are comprised of n vulnerability indicators. The quantity s ( x   k  , y   k  ) measures the similarity between the k th indicator of x and y , and w ( x   k  , y   k  ) is the weighting of the k th attribute. Weights w are equal to 1 when the comparison is valid and 0 when it is invalid. Both s ( x   k  , y   k  ) and w ( x   k  , y   k  ) are defined for different types of data, as shown in Table 1 . Table 1  Implementation of different types of data in HVSI   Type of data x  k  , y  k     s ( x   k  , y   k  )    w ( x   k  , y   k  )   Continuous or ordinal    \\(s\\left( {x_{k} ,y_{k} } \\right) = 1 - \\frac{{|x_{k} - y_{k} |}}{{R_{k} }};\\) where R   k  is the range of the k th indicator    \\(\\begin{aligned} w\\left( {x_{k} ,y_{k} } \\right) & = 0\\quad {\\text{if}}\\;x_{k} \\;{\\text{or}}\\;y_{k} \\;{\\text{is}}\\;{\\text{missing}}; \\\\ w\\left( {x_{k} ,y_{k} } \\right) & = 1\\quad {\\text{otherwise}} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\)    Binary or nominal    \\(\\begin{aligned} s\\left( {x_{k} ,y_{k} } \\right) & = 1\\quad {\\text{if}}\\;x_{k} = y_{k} ; \\\\ s\\left( {x_{k} ,y_{k} } \\right) & = 0\\quad {\\text{otherwise}} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\)    The range R   k  for the k th attribute is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values over all communities being analyzed. HVSI can range from 0, indicating complete dissimilarity, to 1, indicating the two communities are identical in the profiles of their vulnerability indicators. The coefficient would be undefined when there is no valid comparison in any of the attributes (i.e., when w  1 = w  2 = ··· = w   n  = 0). A strength of this formulation is that HVSI, like S  Gower , can handle the challenge of fragmented data availability, since it only includes attributes that have data available for the comparison. HVSI differs from the original S  Gower formulation in its treatment of binary data types: When x   k  = y   k  = 0, s ( x   k  , y   k  ) = 1 (rather than 0, as in S  Gower ). In the current application, the absence of an attribute (e.g., the absence of a floodplain bylaw) is relevant for determining the similarity of communities. The absence of information about whether or not an attribute is present, in contrast, would be treated as missing data, so that w ( x   k  , y   k  ) = 0. Since it is possible for two communities to have an HVSI of 1 even if the comparison were made on the basis of only 1 out of n indicators (the remaining n − 1 being invalid comparisons with missing data), it is useful to have information on the completeness of data on which the comparison is made. In addition to the Gower-type similarity coefficient defined in Eq. 1 and Table 1 , the HVSI is further specified with a completeness index G ( x , y ) that gives the user an indication of the similarity score’s quality: $$G(\\varvec{x},\\varvec{y}) = \\frac{{\\sum\\nolimits_{k = 1}^{n} {w(x_{k} ,y_{k} )} }}{n}$$  (2)  The completeness index ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a situation in which the two communities could not be compared on any of the n indicators, and 1 indicates that all n indicators were used in the comparison. When assessing the similarity of places, it is useful to consider both HVSI and the corresponding value of G . Note that both the similarity index HVSI and the completeness index G can be evaluated for the entire set of indicators or for any subgroup of them. For example, an economic subgroup might be defined that includes several economic vulnerability indicators. Two communities could then be compared for their overall similarity in vulnerability profile, as well their similarity in economic vulnerability only. In the HVSI framework, a distinction is made between indicators and variables. HVSI is specified in terms of a finite number of indicators, each of which corresponds conceptually to a dimension of hazard vulnerability and each of which could be measured by different variables. For example, the concept of economic size is important to vulnerability, as it reflects financial resources available to a community. In the HVSI framework, economic size is treated as an indicator that could be measured by different variables such as number of full-time jobs, number of full-time plus part-time jobs, number of businesses, total income, and gross regional product. Not all communities would have data on all of these variables, but most communities should have at least one. In comparing two communities, any of these variables could be used to measure economic size, provided that data are available for both communities, in other words, provided that a valid comparison is possible. In practice, when an indicator can be measured by more than one variable, it would be measured in the HVSI framework by the first variable in an ordered list for which a valid comparison can be obtained. Note that because the HVSI measures similarity in vulnerability profile, rather than relative degree of vulnerability, it is not necessary for all of the constituent indicators to be specified in ways that imply greater or lesser vulnerability. Nominal variables are permitted that do not have any assumed ordering of hazard vulnerability. For example, an indicator k that represents coastal landform can be specified, where k = 1 might indicate sandy beaches, k = 2 rocky cliffs, etc. Rather than being associated with greater or lesser vulnerability, such an indicator would be useful for indicating different types of vulnerability. 4 Strait of Georgia application Implementation of the HVSI approach is demonstrated here through a limited application to the Strait of Georgia in southern British Columbia, Canada. The study area is very diverse: Communities range from highly urbanized municipalities in the Metro Vancouver region (on the mainland) to cities on Vancouver Island and small, remote towns and villages isolated by water and/or mountains. This demonstration focuses on the 50 largest communities in the region, whose populations range from 4,400 to 603,500. The region faces a number of coastal hazards, including winter storms and storm surge, earthquake, tsunami, and longer-term hazards associated with sea-level rise. Many communities in the region are reliant on ferries for transport of goods and people. The HVSI concept is demonstrated with the indicator framework specified in Table 2 . In the interest of providing a simplified demonstration, this example has fewer indicators and variables than would be used in a full application. For example, no attempt is made here to represent all the social vulnerability indicators that are well-established in the literature, much less the entire range of indicators that have been proposed in other studies. Only one variable is selected per indicator, based largely on data availability in the study area. While many variables in this example are continuous (e.g., percentages and dollars), some are categorical. In this demonstration, data for all variables were available for all communities; thus, the index G is 1.0 in all cases, indicating a complete dataset.

It is further structured around key dimensions of community capitals, specified here as: size, spatial structure, composition, participation, and change. These dimensions provide one way of synthesizing concepts reflected in the broad range of indicators in the disaster vulnerability literature. The “size” dimension captures such concepts as resources available, as well as overall exposure to hazard risk. “Spatial structure” relates more specifically to geospatial aspects of the community that affect risk, while “composition” refers to important nonspatial aspects of community structure and type (e.g., sectoral structure of the economy, diversity, differential vulnerability of population subgroups). “Participation” relates to concepts of networks, access, and integration (or, conversely, isolation). “Change” incorporates aspects of temporal dynamics, in terms of hazard and/or exposure, vulnerability, and community capacity. Such a framework is advantageous in ensuring some consistency across capitals so that results are not skewed toward those aspects for which data are plentiful and many indicators could readily be created. Similarly, it encourages attention to be paid to aspects of vulnerability that are important but may not be immediately apparent (e.g., temporal change). With four types of capital and five key dimensions, 20 indicators in total are used in this demonstration. Data were obtained primarily from the 2011 Census of Canada and the 2011 National Household Survey. Supplementary sources included the 2006 Census, a business database from BC Stats (the provincial statistical agency), DataBC (a provincial spatial database), and CanCoast (a database developed by Natural Resources Canada, a federal government science entity). Visual inspection of map data was used to develop a few of the variables (i.e., “commercial center on coast,” “type of flood hazard” and “protected areas Y/N”). GIS analysis was used to develop one variable (“number of transport connections”). To demonstrate the approach, one community, the district of Squamish, was selected as the focus community. The HVSI was computed for each of the other 49 communities with reference to Squamish, that is, to quantify their similarity levels to Squamish in terms of vulnerability profile. Such an analysis could support decision-makers and planners in Squamish in identifying other communities in the region who share the district’s vulnerability attributes. Results are shown in the sequence of maps in Figs. 1 , 2 and the histogram in Fig. 3 .

The numerical HVSI results indicate that the greatest similarity is with the City of Nanaimo on Vancouver Island. This similarity is moderately high (HVSI = 0.85) and, as shown in Fig. 3 , comparable to the HVSI with a few other communities in the region; there are no communities to which Squamish is highly similar (HVSI > 0.9). These results are consistent with the observation that Squamish is a somewhat unusual community in the region, being a rapidly growing small town situated at the head of Howe Sound. Figure 2 provides further insight by identifying HVSI patterns in terms of the constituent capitals. In terms of economic vulnerability profile (Fig. 2 a), Squamish is quite similar to many of the more urbanized communities in the Metro Vancouver region. Its social vulnerability profile (Fig. 2 b), by contrast, is much more similar to small towns along the coast of Vancouver Island than that to the Metro Vancouver municipalities. In terms of built environment characteristics (Fig. 2 c), Squamish is quite dissimilar to most places in the region, but very similar to a few. Its natural environment characteristics (Fig. 2 d) are highly similar to Campbell River (HVSI  N  = 0.99) on the northernmost reaches of the study area and very dissimilar to many of the Metro Vancouver municipalities located on the Fraser River delta. Nanaimo is moderately similar to Squamish along all of these dimensions. Such findings can help identify communities that have vulnerability attributes in common and that could share information on appropriate risk reduction approaches. For example, if Squamish planners are interested in developing green infrastructure approaches for reducing future flood risks, they could investigate how and if Campbell River (highly similar to Squamish in terms of natural environment) has used green infrastructure. Refinement of the indicator set remains an important area for further research. One key research need is the incorporation of institutional capital and associated indicators, including aspects of governance, planning, and local capacity (e.g., for emergency response and climate change adaptation). For example, a key variable would be whether or not a community has bylaws or other land-use plans for restricting coastal development in hazard-prone areas. The HVSI approach could then be used to identify not just instances of similarity, but also of difference. Planners in a community without such land-use controls could use the HVSI approach to identify other communities that are different in that they already have land-use control but yet similar in terms of other vulnerability attributes (e.g., subject to both coastal and riverine flooding, with existing coastal defenses such as dikes). Information could then be shared regarding land-use planning that is relevant to the particular economic, social, built, and natural environmental context. As discussed in Sect. 2 above, the ability to customize combinations of indicators is important for users to query vulnerability indicator data in ways that would be most informative for local concerns. For example, an economic stakeholder (e.g., Chamber of Commerce) may be most interested in economic indicators, while emergency managers and mitigation planners may focus on hazard exposure variables for coastal flooding (e.g., commercial center on coast, type of flood hazard, landform, structural flood protection) to identify other similar communities. Such transparency may also be helpful in prioritizing data collection and identifying foci for more detailed vulnerability assessments. Further research is needed to identify specific variables that may be most informative for purposes of sharing information on planning for coastal risk reduction. Other future refinements of the methodology are warranted. The implications of indicator specification should be explored; for example, the population size indicator could be specified as either a categorical or a continuous variable. The former is advantageous in having a clearly defined range and facilitating the categorization of places; on the other hand, a disadvantage is that it introduces discontinuities between size categories. Future research should calibrate HVSI and provide guidelines for its interpretation; this will require expanding the dataset of communities and variables. In addition, the HVSI method was designed to be able to handle missing data, and this aspect should be empirically explored. This would also allow development of guidelines for interpreting and visualizing the completeness index ( G ) so as to help the user interpret the results. The approach can also be extended in a number of ways for risk reduction. The database and analytical results could be integrated with other spatial information systems such as flood forecasting and warning systems. An intriguing area for further study would be to apply statistical clustering techniques to the vulnerability data to identify groups of communities that are similar. In sum, the illustration suggests that HVSI can be most effective as a tool for communities if it is implemented in an online platform that allows the user to: access both summary assessments and detailed data; customize queries; and access appropriate analytical summaries (e.g., tables and figures) as well as interpretation guidelines to support identifying similar and dissimilar places in an efficient manner. Importantly, once the user has identified other communities of interest (e.g., those that are similar in profile and face similar vulnerability issues), the platform should provide information on these communities and some means for investigating them further, such as links to key planning documents or contact persons in those other communities. 5 Discussion This paper has proposed a Hazard Vulnerability Similarity Index (HVSI) and provided a pilot demonstration to illustrate its practical use. Building on research that has developed quantitative indicators of community vulnerability to hazards, particularly for coastal areas, the HVSI approach involves characterizing communities according to a standardized multidimensional profile of vulnerability, then assessing the similarity of different communities in order to identify places that share similar overall profiles and specific attributes. Rather than ranking places by degree of vulnerability, the objective is to find commonalities (or differences) amongst places. The premise is that identifying similar places is useful for purposes of developing networks, sharing resources, and learning relevant lessons. Full specification of the HVSI framework in terms of specific indicators and variables remains a priority for further research, along with other research areas discussed in Sect. 4 above. The demonstration provided here, however, clearly illustrates the value of the approach. We suggest that a similarity-based approach does not obviate the need for ranking or identifying places with high vulnerability, but complements such studies by helping communities to gain connections that may help in reducing their vulnerability. Further research might revisit the results of prior hazard vulnerability studies (e.g., those that quantified SoVI \n"

Webinar Overview: Sr. Vulnerability Analyst Reid Wightman and Intelligence Analyst Selena Larson from the Dragos Threat Intelligence team overview the 2018 Year in Review: ICS Vulnerabilities report and discuss Dragos’ key findings from public advisories reports throughout the year.  Below are questions from webinar attendees with answers from Reid and Selena:  Q: How do you rank/rate errors? Are these errors in tone/severity or type/classification etc.?  Dragos identifies errors in the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) vector and numeric score. Sometimes the severity of the vulnerability is misstated, or the description itself is incorrect. For instance, common inaccuracies we see reported are whether an attack vector is network or local, and whether user interaction is required. (AV:L, AV:N) (UI:R, UI:N)  Q: Could you please elaborate on the error in reporting? Are the errors related to e.g,. recommended mitigating factors?  A: Errors correlate to errors in CVSS scores. We do identify other issues in advisories, too, such as lack of mitigation advice, conflicting advice, even incorrect identification of the system type (examples include advisories that say “Update FIRMWARE to version…” when the vulnerability is in PC software and not firmware). But those mitigation and other issues don’t count as errors.  Q: Did you see many/any advisories include or reference custom SNORT rules as an added mitigation where appropriate?  A: Some advisories do, yes. These are typically Cisco/TALOS research that include Cisco IDS rules. A lot of times these rules aren’t publicly available, you’ll need a commercial Snort feed.  These are most common with research that is actually done by TALOS.  Q: Do you anticipate lower error rates in CVEs if these findings are reported using the IVSS method vs CVSS method?   A: We’re not sure. There isn’t an agreed-upon standard for IVSS still. If we had a very simple version of IVSS I do think there would be lower error rates, but it will remain to be seen if the industry can rally around a simple standard.  Q: Any feel for Geo breakdowns? Are NA, EMEA or APAC vendors more/less accurate or more/less likely to self-report vulns compared to the others? Siemens seems proactive.  A: Nothing that is backed up by numbers. Certainly Siemens’ self-reporting and other advisories skews things towards the Middle East.  Q: How quick does DHS update advisories when you point out problems?  A: While we used to point out problems to ICS-CERT, we haven’t recently. We tend to report problems to the original researcher, get verification that the score is, indeed, incorrect, and leave it to the researcher to correct the public advisory. We have yet to see a correction in a public advisory using either method.  Q: Is ICS-CERT’s quality as good as other CERTS, or are vendors on the hook to make sure these are good?  A: The results are a bit too skewed towards one vendor to say for sure, but my feeling is that vendors should absolutely get involved if they want accurate reports. The numbers all point to lack of vendor involvement in the disclosure process results in worse advisories.  Q: How do the ICS-CERT advisories differ from the information being disseminated by the ISACs?   A: Dragos does not have access to any ISAC-specific advisories.  Q: Would you attribute the changes in CVEs released more toward reaction to exploits of them or proactive due to change in vendor diligence or response to researchers?  A: The proactive research done by vendors is probably being done by trained teams, and is probably the reason for more accurate advisories. While it’s impossible to prove this from our position, our guess is that yes, reaction to exploits \n",

Some aspects of this definition, namely as regards persons with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been debated due to the Special Procedural Guarantees offered in the context of the Fast-Track Border Procedure . 1  According to L 4375/2016, whether an applicant is in need of special procedural guarantees is for the Asylum Service to assess “within a reasonable period of time after an application for international protection is made, or at any point of the procedure the relevant need arises, whether the applicant is in need of special procedural guarantees” which is in particular the case “when there are indications or claims that he or she is a victim of torture, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence.” 2  The number of asylum seekers registered by the Asylum Service as vulnerable in 2017 is as follows:   Vulnerable persons registered among asylum seekers: 2017    Category of vulnerability    Applicants    Pending    Unaccompanied children    2,275    1,923    Persons suffering from disability or a serious or incurable illness    970    739    Pregnant women / new mothers    645    444    Single parents with minor children    472    286    Victims of torture, rape or other serious forms of violence or exploitation    454    282    Elderly persons    60    51    Victims of human trafficking    4    3    Total    4,880    3,728   Source: Asylum Service, 15 February 2018. Overlap in some cases is due to applicants falling in multiple vulnerability categories.  The number and type of decisions taken at first instance on cases by vulnerable applicants are as follows:   First instance decisions on applications by vulnerable persons: 2017    Category    Refugee status    Subsidiary protection    Rejection    Rate    Inadmissibility    Unaccompanied children    160    27    493    27.5%    740    Persons suffering from disability or a serious or incurable illness    161    27    191    49.6%    377    Pregnant women / new mothers    145    11    99    61.1%    301    Single parents with minor children    117    14    12    91.6%    350    Victims of torture, rape or other serious forms of violence or exploitation    128    4    31    80.9%    92    Elderly persons    15    3    5    78.2%    72    Victims of human trafficking    2    0    0    100%    :   Source: Asylum Service, 15 February 2018. Inadmissibility decisions include: safe third country; Dublin cases; relocation cases; subsequent applications and other inadmissibility grounds.    Screening of vulnerability  The law provides that:  “The Manager of [RIC] or the Unit, acting on a proposal of the Head of the medical screening and psychosocial support unit shall refer persons belonging to vulnerable groups to the competent social support and protection institution. A copy of the medical screening and psychosocial support file shall be sent to the Head of the Open Temporary Reception or Accommodation Structure or competent social support and protection institution, as per case, where the person is being referred to. In all cases the continuity of the medical treatment followed shall be ensured, where necessary.”  Vulnerability identification on the islands  The identification of vulnerability of persons arriving on the islands in the context of the Fast-Track Border Procedure on the islands takes place either by the RIS prior to the registration of the asylum application, or during the asylum procedure.  Vulnerability identification by the RIS  The RIS had outsourced medical and psychological care provision to NGOs, namely Doctors of the World, PRAKSIS and MedIn. In the course of 2017, serious gaps have been reported in the vulnerability assessment by the RIS. These have been exacerbated in mid-2017 due to the transfer of responsibility for health services from NGOs to state actors such as the Ministry of Health and the Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO). 3 Due to considerable delays and at times dysfunctional identification processes, a considerable number of asylum seekers were subjected to an asylum interview, including by EASO caseworkers, without their vulnerability having been assessed. 4  More specifically, the contracts between RIS and NGOs expired at the end of March 2017. 5 However, no appropriate planning and preparation had taken place, due to which takeover of such services by KEELPNO was not feasible at the time. Even though the Greek authorities had proposed an extension of the contract period, this proposal was made late, thereby not allowing the smooth continuation of the provision of medical and psychological services. In particular, the service contracts most NGOs had signed with the Ministry of Migration Policy expired at the end of May, resulting in a huge service gap that was filled temporarily and partially by the Hellenic Red Cross’ limited capacity, until KEELPNO was able to start the takeover by mid-August 2017. 6  Gaps in the provision of services, coupled with a shortage in human resources, 7 led to a significant reduction in capacity to conduct vulnerability screening in the reception and identification procedure, as well as to provide out-patient consultations. 8 As reported, on certain occasions e.g. on Lesvos and Samos during March 2017, the RIS completed the procedure without having assessed potential vulnerabilities and only persons with evident vulnerabilities were subject to medical and psychological assessments and offered assistance. The rest received no assessment unless they so requested, and even in such cases newcomers without evident vulnerabilities were not provided assessments due to these gaps. 9  Additionally, serious concerns have been raised with regard to the quality of the vulnerability screening procedures, notably on the identification of non-evident vulnerabilities. These stem from inadequate training of staff carrying out vulnerability screening, as well as poor investment of time and resources for effective identification and referral of vulnerable persons to protection organisations to ensure their transfer to the mainland. 10 As noted by MSF, “far from being over-identified, vulnerable people are falling through the cracks and are not being adequately identified and cared for.” 11 In particular, out of the total number of cases referred to the MSF clinic on Lesvos , almost 70% belonged to a vulnerable group that had not been recognised as such by the authorities: victims of torture, ill-treatment or sexual violence, persons suffering from PTSD and other serious mental health disorders. Less than 15% of people suffering from serious mental health conditions and less than 30% of victims of torture had been identified as vulnerable. 12  The lack of a uniform practice with regard to referrals to the medical and psychological units of the RIS following registration has also been witnessed. This was the case on Chios during September 2017 when arrival rates were relatively high and newly arrived persons suffered delays of up to two months until they could access medical and psychological services. On Samos on the contrary, the reception and identification procedures, including medical and psychosocial screening, were conducted very briefly, thereby running the risk of omitting non-evident vulnerabilities. GCR has repeatedly reported that the outcome of the vulnerability assessment by medical experts and the psychosocial unit of the RIC of Samos is not uploaded on the electronic database of the RIC, while neither the applicant nor his or her lawyer have access to the document. Accordingly, the vulnerability assessment is not taken into account in subsequent procedures, for instance the fast-track border procedure.  “Medium” and “high” vulnerability: the new vulnerability template  A new medical vulnerability template, entitled “Form for the medical and psychosocial evaluation of vulnerability”, has been adopted by KEELPNO as of the end of 2017 and early 2018. 13 This template introduces two levels of vulnerability:   Medium vulnerability, which could develop if no precautionary measures are introduced;    High vulnerability, when the occurrence of vulnerability is obvious and the continuation of the evaluation and the adoption of a care plan are recommended. Further referral is needed for immediate support.   The classification of a case as “medium” or “high” vulnerability is decided by the medical unit of each RIC on the islands.  Even if the distinction between “medium” and “high” vulnerability concerns the medical terminology used and the support that the person should receive, this vulnerability assessment procedure is used in a way in practice which underestimates vulnerabilities classified as “medium”, despite the fact that such a distinction is not provided by law. As observed by GCR and other actors in the field, cases classified as “medium” vulnerability not being uploaded on the electronic database of the RIC and thus not being taken into consideration; further assessment is requested instead. However, given the backlog of cases before the medical and psychological services on the islands, it is not clear whether persons with identified “medium” vulnerabilities can benefit from further assessment and care.  Furthermore, GCR is also aware of classifications of “medium” vulnerability being given to cases such as victims of sexual violence \n"

NIST’s call for public comment on version 1.1 of its Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity brought the issue to light.  Several other security companies and organizations, such as Cisco, Symantec, Bugcrowd and many others, including the Center for Democracy & Technology, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), etc. also signed the letter.  The impetus behind the comments is to clarify the existing elements of the framework and outline processes for receiving, assessing and mitigating security vulnerabilities from outside sources, such as independent researchers.

But determining which vulnerabilities are most at risk of being exploited by attackers remains hard to predict. Data science and machine learning are seemingly ready to offer some answers. Two research efforts could provide insights into those vulnerabilities you'll most likely need to patch quickly. The information can make companies much more efficient in their patching efforts, closing the security holes that would be the most probable vectors for future attacks. At the USENIX Security Conference in August , for example, a group of researchers from the University of Maryland at College Park, the University of Michigan, and Harvard University found that, using community structures for both attackers and defenders, they could determine whether a vulnerability was being exploited with 90% precision, using at most 10 days of data. The research holds lessons for application security professionals and infrastructure operators. Because only 2% of vulnerabilities are exploited in the wild, trying to patch every vulnerability results in wasted effort, according to Kenna Security. Even looking at a basic factor—the existence of an exploit—can reduce the total population of attacker-exploited vulnerabilities. A vulnerability with published exploit code is seven times more likely to be exploited in the wild, Kenna Security and data-science firm Cyentia found in its report, Prioritization to Prediction: Analyzing Vulnerability Remediation Strategies , published in May. Here's how to determine on which vulnerabilities your team should put its focus.  How to Get the Most From Your Application Security Testing Budget    GET REPORT    1. Criticality is not a good measure of likely exploitation The Common Vulnerability Scoring System offers one measure of the severity of a vulnerability; it's intended to indicate the potential of a vulnerability to create havoc in affected software. The best strategy—patching all vulnerabilities with a score of 7 or higher—catches about 53% of all vulnerabilities that are eventually exploited in the wild, compared to 38% for a strategy of randomly selecting vulnerabilities. But just 31% of the vulnerabilities identified as expected to be exploited will actually be exploited in the wild, leaving defenders to patch more than 25,000 vulnerabilities, according to Kenna Security's research. Michael Roytman, chief data scientist for Kenna Security, said that when you look at all the vulnerabilities, the chance of a specific vulnerability actually being exploited in the wild is rare. So there is a high probability that any yes-no slice of the data, such as 'we remediate all criticals,' is likely to have a lot of wasted effort and is going to be imprecise.\" — Michael Roytman 2. Vulnerabilities on lists may be more likely to be exploited You'll find vulnerabilities discussed on a variety of mailing lists and databases, including Bugtraq, BID, Microsoft's list, Sectrack and others. While no single list is a great predictor of whether a vulnerability will eventually be exploited, many of these lists do correlate with a higher likelihood, according to Kenna Security's research. \"What we have found to predict exploitation is whether it has exploit, the number of vulnerabilities in the wild, and whether it is on the Microsoft reference list \n"

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

The user must take action to open the image file, but these files can be sent via email or instant message, or downloaded by an unsuspecting Web surfer. Reports say the vulnerability can allow the attacker to take full control of the affected system.

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

      "\t\t    Definition Schema for writing the tests, and OVAL\n",

The user must take action to open the image file, but these files can be sent via email or instant message, or downloaded by an unsuspecting Web surfer.

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

      "\t\t    Definition Schema for writing the tests, and OVAL\n",

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

The user must take action to open the image file, but these files can be sent via email or instant message, or downloaded by an unsuspecting Web surfer.

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

      "\t\t    Definition Schema for writing the tests, and OVAL\n",

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

Other component schemas include Microsoft Windows, Sun Solaris, Red Hat Linux, Debian Linux, UNIX, and Cisco IOS. Working with these component schemas is a core or \"parent\" schema that provides the general format for an OVAL Definition and a place for expressing platform-independent metadata (e.g., the CVE identifier).

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

All Windows XP and Server 2003 installations are vulnerable, including those that are fully patched.  The user must take action to open the image file, but these files can be sent via email or instant message, or downloaded by an unsuspecting Web surfer. Reports say the vulnerability can allow the attacker to take full control of the affected system. There is no patch or Hotfix currently available, but Microsoft encourages users to keep their anti-virus and anti-spyware software up-to-date and to employ a firewall.

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

The new process includes formal compatibility evaluations, the posting of questionnaires citing how the organizations have satisfied the OVAL and OVAL-ID compatibility requirements, and a \"branding program\" with an official OVAL and OVAL-ID compatibility logo for vendors to include with their products and for system administrators and other security professionals to look for when adopting vulnerability management products and services for their enterprise.  Specifically, the expanded OVAL and OVAL-ID Compatibility Process involves two phases:  (1) Declaration\n",

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

      "\t\t\tVulnerability Management Through Standards \" in the May 2005 issue of CrossTalk,\n",
      "\t\t\tThe Journal of Defense Engineering . The article discusses the U.S Department of Defense's (DOD) new enterprise licenses for vulnerability assessment and remediation tools that require using capabilities that conform to the OVAL and CVE standards efforts. The author states: \"In combination with procedural changes, the adoption of these and other standards such as the National Security Agency’s Extensible Markup Language Configuration Checklist Data Format, are making it possible to radically improve the accuracy and timeliness of the DOD's remediation and measurement activities, which are critical to ensuring the network and systems integrity of their network-centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL is mentioned throughout this article in which the author\n",

      "\t\t\tand checking guidelines into these standards is also under way, which will\n",
      "\t\t\tset the stage for the formal process to be changed.\"  The author concludes the article as follows: \"DoD is moving to its new process by requiring the inclusion of CVE names and standardized OVAL XML vulnerability and configuration tests in software supplier's alerts and advisories, and by acquiring tools that can import new and future OVAL XML test definitions and export their findings as standardized OVAL XML results. By also obtaining capabilities that can import the OVAL XML results for remediation, organizational status reporting, and generating certification and accreditation reports, the DoD will have created a focused, efficient, timely, and effective enterprise incident management and remediation process by adopting information security products, services, and methodologies that support the CVE naming standard and use OVAL test definitions and results schemas.\" \"Collectively these changes will dramatically improve the insight and oversight of the security and integrity of the systems and networks underlying tomorrow's network- centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL Mentioned in Article about Software Vulnerabilities in InfoSecurity Magazine  OVAL was mentioned in a May 15, 2005 article about software vulnerabilities entitled \" CA\n",

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

MITRE established the advisory council to help guide CVE and OVAL and to ensure the initiatives receive appropriate funding, and to help us all understand potential relationships with other ongoing activities, share information, and promote synergy across the security community.

      "\t\t\tVulnerability Management Through Standards \" in the May 2005 issue of CrossTalk,\n",
      "\t\t\tThe Journal of Defense Engineering . The article discusses the U.S Department of Defense's (DOD) new enterprise licenses for vulnerability assessment and remediation tools that require using capabilities that conform to the OVAL and CVE standards efforts. The author states: \"In combination with procedural changes, the adoption of these and other standards such as the National Security Agency’s Extensible Markup Language Configuration Checklist Data Format, are making it possible to radically improve the accuracy and timeliness of the DOD's remediation and measurement activities, which are critical to ensuring the network and systems integrity of their network-centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL is mentioned throughout this article in which the author\n",

      "\t\t\tand checking guidelines into these standards is also under way, which will\n",
      "\t\t\tset the stage for the formal process to be changed.\"  The author concludes the article as follows: \"DoD is moving to its new process by requiring the inclusion of CVE names and standardized OVAL XML vulnerability and configuration tests in software supplier's alerts and advisories, and by acquiring tools that can import new and future OVAL XML test definitions and export their findings as standardized OVAL XML results. By also obtaining capabilities that can import the OVAL XML results for remediation, organizational status reporting, and generating certification and accreditation reports, the DoD will have created a focused, efficient, timely, and effective enterprise incident management and remediation process by adopting information security products, services, and methodologies that support the CVE naming standard and use OVAL test definitions and results schemas.\" \"Collectively these changes will dramatically improve the insight and oversight of the security and integrity of the systems and networks underlying tomorrow's network- centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL Mentioned in Article about Software Vulnerabilities in InfoSecurity Magazine  OVAL was mentioned in a May 15, 2005 article about software vulnerabilities entitled \" CA\n",

All Windows XP and Server 2003 installations are vulnerable, including those that are fully patched.  The user must take action to open the image file, but these files can be sent via email or instant message, or downloaded by an unsuspecting Web surfer. Reports say the vulnerability can allow the attacker to take full control of the affected system.

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

      "\t\t    Definition Schema for writing the tests, and OVAL\n",

Back to top  April 29, 2005  Senior Advisory Council Holds Meeting  The CVE Senior Advisory Council , which also provides oversight for the OVAL effort, held a meeting on Monday, April 25, 2005. Topics included U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) vulnerability management using (Extensible Markup Language Configuration Checklist Data Format) XCCDF, OVAL, and CVE; the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) enterprise-wide Microsoft license and contract; an update on Center for Internet Security (CIS) information security benchmarks and tools; and status updates on CME, CVE, and OVAL.  MITRE established the advisory council to help guide CVE and OVAL and to ensure the initiatives receive appropriate funding, and to help us all understand potential relationships with other ongoing activities, share information, and promote synergy across the security community. The advisory council is composed of senior executives from offices across the U.S. federal government who are responsible for information assurance on government networks and systems.

      "\t\t\tVulnerability Management Through Standards \" in the May 2005 issue of CrossTalk,\n",
      "\t\t\tThe Journal of Defense Engineering . The article discusses the U.S Department of Defense's (DOD) new enterprise licenses for vulnerability assessment and remediation tools that require using capabilities that conform to the OVAL and CVE standards efforts. The author states: \"In combination with procedural changes, the adoption of these and other standards such as the National Security Agency’s Extensible Markup Language Configuration Checklist Data Format, are making it possible to radically improve the accuracy and timeliness of the DOD's remediation and measurement activities, which are critical to ensuring the network and systems integrity of their network-centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL is mentioned throughout this article in which the author\n",
      "\t\t\tdescribes what OVAL is and isn't, mentions that there are organizations\n",

      "\t\t\tprocurements have started requiring support for the standards that will enable\n",
      "\t\t\tthe transition to this new IAVA process. Work in transforming current checklists\n",
      "\t\t\tand checking guidelines into these standards is also under way, which will\n",
      "\t\t\tset the stage for the formal process to be changed.\"  The author concludes the article as follows: \"DoD is moving to its new process by requiring the inclusion of CVE names and standardized OVAL XML vulnerability and configuration tests in software supplier's alerts and advisories, and by acquiring tools that can import new and future OVAL XML test definitions and export their findings as standardized OVAL XML results. By also obtaining capabilities that can import the OVAL XML results for remediation, organizational status reporting, and generating certification and accreditation reports, the DoD will have created a focused, efficient, timely, and effective enterprise incident management and remediation process by adopting information security products, services, and methodologies that support the CVE naming standard and use OVAL test definitions and results schemas.\" \"Collectively these changes will dramatically improve the insight and oversight of the security and integrity of the systems and networks underlying tomorrow's network- centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL Mentioned in Article about Software Vulnerabilities in InfoSecurity Magazine  OVAL was mentioned in a May 15, 2005 article about software vulnerabilities entitled \" CA\n",

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

      "\t\t    Definition Schema for writing the tests, and OVAL\n",

Other component schemas include Microsoft Windows, Sun Solaris, Red Hat Linux, Debian Linux, UNIX, and Cisco IOS. Working with these component schemas is a core or \"parent\" schema that provides the general format for an OVAL Definition and a place for expressing platform-independent metadata (e.g., the CVE identifier).

MITRE established the advisory council to help guide CVE and OVAL and to ensure the initiatives receive appropriate funding, and to help us all understand potential relationships with other ongoing activities, share information, and promote synergy across the security community.

      "\t\t\tVulnerability Management Through Standards \" in the May 2005 issue of CrossTalk,\n",
      "\t\t\tThe Journal of Defense Engineering . The article discusses the U.S Department of Defense's (DOD) new enterprise licenses for vulnerability assessment and remediation tools that require using capabilities that conform to the OVAL and CVE standards efforts. The author states: \"In combination with procedural changes, the adoption of these and other standards such as the National Security Agency’s Extensible Markup Language Configuration Checklist Data Format, are making it possible to radically improve the accuracy and timeliness of the DOD's remediation and measurement activities, which are critical to ensuring the network and systems integrity of their network-centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL is mentioned throughout this article in which the author\n",

      "\t\t\tset the stage for the formal process to be changed.\"  The author concludes the article as follows: \"DoD is moving to its new process by requiring the inclusion of CVE names and standardized OVAL XML vulnerability and configuration tests in software supplier's alerts and advisories, and by acquiring tools that can import new and future OVAL XML test definitions and export their findings as standardized OVAL XML results. By also obtaining capabilities that can import the OVAL XML results for remediation, organizational status reporting, and generating certification and accreditation reports, the DoD will have created a focused, efficient, timely, and effective enterprise incident management and remediation process by adopting information security products, services, and methodologies that support the CVE naming standard and use OVAL test definitions and results schemas.\" \"Collectively these changes will dramatically improve the insight and oversight of the security and integrity of the systems and networks underlying tomorrow's network- centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL Mentioned in Article about Software Vulnerabilities in InfoSecurity Magazine  OVAL was mentioned in a May 15, 2005 article about software vulnerabilities entitled \" CA\n",

The user must take action to open the image file, but these files can be sent via email or instant message, or downloaded by an unsuspecting Web surfer. Reports say the vulnerability can allow the attacker to take full control of the affected system.

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

      "\t\t    Definition Schema for writing the tests, and OVAL\n",

      "\t\t\tVulnerability Management Through Standards \" in the May 2005 issue of CrossTalk,\n",
      "\t\t\tThe Journal of Defense Engineering . The article discusses the U.S Department of Defense's (DOD) new enterprise licenses for vulnerability assessment and remediation tools that require using capabilities that conform to the OVAL and CVE standards efforts. The author states: \"In combination with procedural changes, the adoption of these and other standards such as the National Security Agency’s Extensible Markup Language Configuration Checklist Data Format, are making it possible to radically improve the accuracy and timeliness of the DOD's remediation and measurement activities, which are critical to ensuring the network and systems integrity of their network-centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL is mentioned throughout this article in which the author\n",

      "\t\t\tand checking guidelines into these standards is also under way, which will\n",
      "\t\t\tset the stage for the formal process to be changed.\"  The author concludes the article as follows: \"DoD is moving to its new process by requiring the inclusion of CVE names and standardized OVAL XML vulnerability and configuration tests in software supplier's alerts and advisories, and by acquiring tools that can import new and future OVAL XML test definitions and export their findings as standardized OVAL XML results. By also obtaining capabilities that can import the OVAL XML results for remediation, organizational status reporting, and generating certification and accreditation reports, the DoD will have created a focused, efficient, timely, and effective enterprise incident management and remediation process by adopting information security products, services, and methodologies that support the CVE naming standard and use OVAL test definitions and results schemas.\" \"Collectively these changes will dramatically improve the insight and oversight of the security and integrity of the systems and networks underlying tomorrow's network- centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL Mentioned in Article about Software Vulnerabilities in InfoSecurity Magazine  OVAL was mentioned in a May 15, 2005 article about software vulnerabilities entitled \" CA\n",

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

      "\t\t\tVulnerability Management Through Standards \" in the May 2005 issue of CrossTalk,\n",
      "\t\t\tThe Journal of Defense Engineering . The article discusses the U.S Department of Defense's (DOD) new enterprise licenses for vulnerability assessment and remediation tools that require using capabilities that conform to the OVAL and CVE standards efforts. The author states: \"In combination with procedural changes, the adoption of these and other standards such as the National Security Agency’s Extensible Markup Language Configuration Checklist Data Format, are making it possible to radically improve the accuracy and timeliness of the DOD's remediation and measurement activities, which are critical to ensuring the network and systems integrity of their network-centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL is mentioned throughout this article in which the author\n",

      "\t\t\tand checking guidelines into these standards is also under way, which will\n",
      "\t\t\tset the stage for the formal process to be changed.\"  The author concludes the article as follows: \"DoD is moving to its new process by requiring the inclusion of CVE names and standardized OVAL XML vulnerability and configuration tests in software supplier's alerts and advisories, and by acquiring tools that can import new and future OVAL XML test definitions and export their findings as standardized OVAL XML results. By also obtaining capabilities that can import the OVAL XML results for remediation, organizational status reporting, and generating certification and accreditation reports, the DoD will have created a focused, efficient, timely, and effective enterprise incident management and remediation process by adopting information security products, services, and methodologies that support the CVE naming standard and use OVAL test definitions and results schemas.\" \"Collectively these changes will dramatically improve the insight and oversight of the security and integrity of the systems and networks underlying tomorrow's network- centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL Mentioned in Article about Software Vulnerabilities in InfoSecurity Magazine  OVAL was mentioned in a May 15, 2005 article about software vulnerabilities entitled \" CA\n",

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

Topics included U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) vulnerability management using (Extensible Markup Language Configuration Checklist Data Format) XCCDF, OVAL, and CVE; the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) enterprise-wide Microsoft license and contract; an update on Center for Internet Security (CIS) information security benchmarks and tools; and status updates on CME, CVE, and OVAL.  MITRE established the advisory council to help guide CVE and OVAL and to ensure the initiatives receive appropriate funding, and to help us all understand potential relationships with other ongoing activities, share information, and promote synergy across the security community. The advisory council is composed of senior executives from offices across the U.S. federal government who are responsible for information assurance on government networks and systems.

      "\t\t\tVulnerability Management Through Standards \" in the May 2005 issue of CrossTalk,\n",
      "\t\t\tThe Journal of Defense Engineering . The article discusses the U.S Department of Defense's (DOD) new enterprise licenses for vulnerability assessment and remediation tools that require using capabilities that conform to the OVAL and CVE standards efforts. The author states: \"In combination with procedural changes, the adoption of these and other standards such as the National Security Agency’s Extensible Markup Language Configuration Checklist Data Format, are making it possible to radically improve the accuracy and timeliness of the DOD's remediation and measurement activities, which are critical to ensuring the network and systems integrity of their network-centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL is mentioned throughout this article in which the author\n",
      "\t\t\tdescribes what OVAL is and isn't, mentions that there are organizations\n",

      "\t\t\tand checking guidelines into these standards is also under way, which will\n",
      "\t\t\tset the stage for the formal process to be changed.\"  The author concludes the article as follows: \"DoD is moving to its new process by requiring the inclusion of CVE names and standardized OVAL XML vulnerability and configuration tests in software supplier's alerts and advisories, and by acquiring tools that can import new and future OVAL XML test definitions and export their findings as standardized OVAL XML results. By also obtaining capabilities that can import the OVAL XML results for remediation, organizational status reporting, and generating certification and accreditation reports, the DoD will have created a focused, efficient, timely, and effective enterprise incident management and remediation process by adopting information security products, services, and methodologies that support the CVE naming standard and use OVAL test definitions and results schemas.\" \"Collectively these changes will dramatically improve the insight and oversight of the security and integrity of the systems and networks underlying tomorrow's network- centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL Mentioned in Article about Software Vulnerabilities in InfoSecurity Magazine  OVAL was mentioned in a May 15, 2005 article about software vulnerabilities entitled \" CA\n",

The user must take action to open the image file, but these files can be sent via email or instant message, or downloaded by an unsuspecting Web surfer. Reports say the vulnerability can allow the attacker to take full control of the affected system.

Back to top  December 22, 2005  OVAL Celebrates 3 Years  OVAL began three years ago this month as a new community baseline standard for how vulnerabilities could be identified on local computers. Since that time the initiative has grown significantly and is now a developing international, information security community standard for how to check for the presence of vulnerabilities and configuration issues on computer systems. Highlights of our progress are noted below.  OVAL Schemas  When OVAL began we used Structured Query Language (SQL) for the official OVAL Schema and OVAL queries in SQL to perform the tests. In late 2003, at the request of the community and because of the limits of SQL, we adopted Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the official format for writing OVAL schemas and the XML definitions that perform the tests. OVAL has also grown from a single schema for writing the tests into three separate schemas, one for each step of the overall process: an OVAL\n",

      "\t\t    Definition Schema for writing the tests, and OVAL\n",

Back to top  April 29, 2005  Senior Advisory Council Holds Meeting  The CVE Senior Advisory Council , which also provides oversight for the OVAL effort, held a meeting on Monday, April 25, 2005. Topics included U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) vulnerability management using (Extensible Markup Language Configuration Checklist Data Format) XCCDF, OVAL, and CVE; the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) enterprise-wide Microsoft license and contract; an update on Center for Internet Security (CIS) information security benchmarks and tools; and status updates on CME, CVE, and OVAL.  MITRE established the advisory council to help guide CVE and OVAL and to ensure the initiatives receive appropriate funding, and to help us all understand potential relationships with other ongoing activities, share information, and promote synergy across the security community. The advisory council is composed of senior executives from offices across the U.S. federal government who are responsible for information assurance on government networks and systems.

      "\t\t\tcharter .   OVAL Standards Effort a Main Topic of Article in CrossTalk  OVAL was a main topic in an article by OVAL Compatibility Lead Robert A. Martin entitled \" Transformational\n",
      "\t\t\tVulnerability Management Through Standards \" in the May 2005 issue of CrossTalk,\n",
      "\t\t\tThe Journal of Defense Engineering . The article discusses the U.S Department of Defense's (DOD) new enterprise licenses for vulnerability assessment and remediation tools that require using capabilities that conform to the OVAL and CVE standards efforts. The author states: \"In combination with procedural changes, the adoption of these and other standards such as the National Security Agency’s Extensible Markup Language Configuration Checklist Data Format, are making it possible to radically improve the accuracy and timeliness of the DOD's remediation and measurement activities, which are critical to ensuring the network and systems integrity of their network-centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL is mentioned throughout this article in which the author\n",
      "\t\t\tdescribes what OVAL is and isn't, mentions that there are organizations\n",
      "\t\t\t  that have made declarations of\n",
      "\t\t\t  OVAL Compatibility ,\n",
      "\t\t\tand describes OVAL definitions and the Official\n",
      "\t\t\tOVAL Schemas and their potential\n",
      "\t\t\tuses. How OVAL improves vulnerability assessment is also described\n",
      "\t\t\tin the caption to an illustration entitled \"Standard-Based IAVA Process\" in\n",
      "\t\t\twhich the author notes that the new Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert\n",
      "\t\t\t(IAVA) requirements call for the use of \"OVAL definitions on how to identify\n",
      "\t\t\tthe new issue. Assessment tools are capable of using the OVAL definitions;\n",
      "\t\t\tthey report their findings per the OVAL results XML standard. These same standard-based\n",
      "\t\t\tresults are fed into the reporting process and the remediation process. Various\n",
      "\t\t\tprocurements have started requiring support for the standards that will enable\n",
      "\t\t\tthe transition to this new IAVA process. Work in transforming current checklists\n",
      "\t\t\tand checking guidelines into these standards is also under way, which will\n",
      "\t\t\tset the stage for the formal process to be changed.\"  The author concludes the article as follows: \"DoD is moving to its new process by requiring the inclusion of CVE names and standardized OVAL XML vulnerability and configuration tests in software supplier's alerts and advisories, and by acquiring tools that can import new and future OVAL XML test definitions and export their findings as standardized OVAL XML results. By also obtaining capabilities that can import the OVAL XML results for remediation, organizational status reporting, and generating certification and accreditation reports, the DoD will have created a focused, efficient, timely, and effective enterprise incident management and remediation process by adopting information security products, services, and methodologies that support the CVE naming standard and use OVAL test definitions and results schemas.\" \"Collectively these changes will dramatically improve the insight and oversight of the security and integrity of the systems and networks underlying tomorrow's network- centric warfare capabilities.\"  OVAL Mentioned in Article about Software Vulnerabilities in InfoSecurity Magazine  OVAL was mentioned in a May 15, 2005 article about software vulnerabilities entitled \" CA\n",

One of the subjects that caught my attention was Scrutinizer’s ability to mitigate insider threats. Honestly, I really wanted to dig deeper on all the subjects on my list, but the marketing team frowned on me passing along a hundred-page report when they were really looking or two-page fact sheet with links. As time passed, the idea of Scrutinizer’s ability to monitor, detect, and mitigate these types of threats kept on tugging at me. So when I got the opportunity to talk more about it, I jumped on it. What is an insider threat? I’m sure that most of you are familiar with what an insider threat is, but I wanted to make sure that everyone reading was on the same page. “Insider threat is a generic term for a threat to an organization’s security or data that comes from within. Such threats are usually attributed to employees or former employees, but may also arise from third parties, including contractors, temporary workers or customers.” – TechTarget Scary, isn’t it? A lot of companies are facing the issue where people with varied degrees of technology skills can be a huge security threat. In addition, just the sheer size of some of today’s networks can hinder the ability to understand what a current or former employees is or was doing from day to day. This limits companies when trying to stop insider threats. Strategy 1:  Use metadata to gain complete visibility and stop insider threats As I mentioned, the sheer size and scope of today’s networks can hinder the security team’s visibility that is needed to detect things like insider threats. That’s where metadata like NetFlow/IPFIX come in. NetFlow/IPFIX delivers a record of every conversation, along with other important conversation elements, to a reporting/monitoring tool via a UDP stream. Many of today’s networking devices support this type of flow. Using this metadata resource with a reporting/monitoring platform that fully leverages the data allows you to gain visibility across your entire network with far less overhead. Strategy 2:  Have a data retention policy that exceeds that requirements of your compliance or departmental policies Having a record of every conversation, even the little ones that hang out at the bottom, is no longer a luxury in today’s digital world. With attacks and other nefarious activities running rampant, and with the numerous compliance laws and regulations, the ability to retain conversation data for an extended amount of time is a now a requirement and is vital for stopping insider threats. Clearly a strong data foundation is important for seeing and stopping insider threats. I have worked with people on both sides of this story. On one side I have worked with companies that didn’t have this historical data and when a threat was detected, they had little information for investigation. I have also worked with people who leveraged their historical flow data to investigate the incident and used that same data to report or monitor other related hosts/conversations . Strategy 3: Leverage DNS monitoring tools \n",

The impact of cyber-attacks including the 2017 WannaCry, data breaches and account takeover attacks leveraging global payments systems against central banks and regulators demonstrate that security is a global concern. The CERES Forum will help these entities be more effective in defending against attacks that could impact the global financial services sector and the world’s economies.  “Cyberthreats have become increasingly frequent, complex and sophisticated,” said Bill Nelson, FS-ISAC president and chief executive officer. “The sharing of information and best practices among authorities in a timely way to address the rapidly evolving threats is critical. Today, there is no dedicated forum or system for regulators, central banks and supervisors to share information on cyber and physical threats. The CERES Forum will bridge that gap with a platform that facilitates secure sharing of information about threats, vulnerabilities and incidences to stay ahead of crime.”  The new forum is separate from the FS-ISAC community of banks, credit unions, insurance companies, investment companies and other financial institutions, which provides a trusted space for private financial institutions to share information. A new standalone secure portal and processes will ensure FS-ISAC member confidentiality.  The mission of the CERES Forum is to provide a trusted means for central banks, regulators and supervisors to:   Share best practices related to regulatory and compliance controls  Gather useful feedback from industry about which controls are most effective  Distribute rapidly information on cyberthreats, vulnerabilities, incidents and \n",

This site contains archived STIX 1.x documentation. STIX is now maintained by the OASIS CTI TC .      Data Model Documentation    Heads up! These docs are for STIX 1.0, which is not the latest version (2.0). View the latest!   Package   The Package construct serves as a container for grouping sets of related content. That content might be related because it’s part of the same report or it might be as simple as it’s being published at the same time. The package gives that context a wrapper and allows for metadata to be described about the content as a group.   Campaign   A STIX Campaign represents a set of TTPs, incidents, or threat actors that together express a common intent or desired effect. For example, an adversary using a particular set of TTPs (malware and tools) to target an industry sector with a specific intent may constitute a campaign. In the STIX data model, campaigns represent both that intent itself and, perhaps more importantly, act as a meta-construct to relate the associated TTPs, incidents, and threat actors that are part of that campaign together.   Course of Action   A STIX Course of Action component is used to convey information about courses of action that may be taken either in response to an attack or as a preventative measure prior to an attack. They are used to express both courses of action that might be taken (are possible options are are suggested) in the course of an incident to respond to something that has occurred or to mitigate the effect of an exploit target (vulnerability or misconfiguration) apriori.  The course of action component itself contains information about the objective of the action, its efficacy, its likely impact, cost, structured parameter observables, and even a structured course of action meant to be implemented automatically in a tool.   Exploit Target   A STIX Exploit Target conveys information about a technical vulnerability, weakness, or misconfiguration in software, systems, or networks that may be targeted for exploitation by an adversary. The exploit target component leverages current standard approaches in identifying and describing vulnerabilities through the suggested option of using CVE and/or OSVDB IDs to identify named vulnerabilities, CVRF to describe 0-day or other unnamed vulnerabilities, and CVSS to score vulnerabilities. Additionally, CCE is used as the suggested method to identify configuration items and CWE as a mechanism for representing software weaknesses.  In the STIX relationship model, exploit targets are used to identify possible targets of a TTP and can reference courses of action as potential mechanisms to remediate the exploit target.   Incident    A STIX Incident conveys information about a cyber security incident. This may be the most familiar STIX construct to those with a background in computer security and incident response. As you’d expect, it contains a good deal of information about what occurred, the impact of the incident on systems and information, the incident timeline, points of contact, and other descriptive information.  In the STIX relationship model, incidents can be related to the threat actors involved, the campaigns that they’re a part of, courses of action that were taken or were suggested, indicators that were used to detect the incident or were discovered as part of the investigation, TTPs that were used to carry out the incident, and observables that were detected during the incident.   Indicator    A STIX Indicator conveys specific Observable patterns combined with contextual information intended to represent artifacts and/or behaviors of interest within a cyber security context. They consist of one or more Observable patterns potentially mapped to a related TTP context and adorned with other relevant metadata on things like confidence in the indicator’s assertion, handling restrictions, valid time windows, likely impact, sightings of the indicator, structured test mechanisms for detection, related campaigns, suggested courses of action, related indicators, the source of the Indicator, etc. Recognizing limitations in current standardized approaches of representation, STIX leverages community knowledge and best practices to define a new Indicator structure for representing Indicator information.   Threat Actor    A STIX Threat Actor conveys information that characterizes or identifies (or both) an adversary. The characterization consists of information like the sophistication of the threat actor, its motivations and desired effects, and historically observed behavior. In the STIX relationship model, threat actors also include information such as observed TTPs, historic (or current) campaigns, \n"

Instead the highest priority should be to stop a cyberthreat before it compromises the organization. But in reality, preventing a cyberattack from landing is not always possible. The steps for incident or breach identification – from threat hunting to searching for explicit Indicators of Compromise (IoC) – are well established. While the processes will vary from organization to organization, malware, compromised accounts, lateral movement, etc. will all need to be addressed as a part of any formal clean-up plan.  If a breach is severe enough (for example, including the compromise of domain controllers), organizations may have no choice other than to reinstall the entire environment from scratch. While that is a worst-case scenario, it does happen. In many cases, businesses may choose to scrub servers as best as possible versus performing a complete reinstall. That is a business decision based on risk, feasibility, and cost. It also represents a no-win scenario if the threat is a persistent presence that uses techniques to evade traditional identification measures. If you think that is far-fetched, just look at the history of threats like rootkits, Spectre , and Meltdown that prove there is always a way to attack a technology resource.  Threat actors are after your credentials  Regardless of your remediation strategy, you can be assured that, via some fashion \n",

Solutions and Services  State of the Hack Episode 09: Holiday APT Spectacular   December 11, 2018  |  by Christopher Glyer , Nick Carr    State of the Hack      This month, we took a break from traveling to conferences and speaking with front-line defenders so that we could recap some of the most interesting activity that we’ve analyzed in recent months. We spent this whole State of the Hack episode, the last of 2018, at our new office in Reston, VA talking about interesting threat intelligence conclusions, APT29 emerging from the dark, unique attacker malware and techniques, and some of our latest FireEye blog posts. Think of it as a return to our roots – finishing 2018 the way we kicked things off in Episode 1 earlier this year.  &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;  Episode Recap and More Information  “Viewing the News from the Trenches”: We start off by discussing FireEye's recent conclusions that the intrusion activity that led to deployment of the TRITON ICS malware framework was supported by a Russian government-owned technical research institution located in Moscow. Next, we shift to a recent suspected APT29 phishing campaign that involved intrusion attempts against multiple industries, including law enforcement, media, and U.S. military. We then talk about the Department of Justice announcement that two Iranian men were indicted for their roles in distributing SamSam ransomware that ultimately led to losses exceeding $30 million, as well as what the Chinese Ministry of State Security indictments mean for contextualizing the physical side of an IT compromise.  “Novel Technique Adoption”: We spend some time talking about DNS Over HTTPS, a protocol that is intended to improve user privacy and security yet is ripe for abuse by attackers. A big shout out to David Middlehurst ( @dtmsecurity ) with SpiderLabs for his hard work on this topic, and also for talking about it with us at MITRE ATT&CKcon in October. We also chat about profilers – specifically web profilers and document profilers – that are used by attackers to determine whether or not they want to deliver a specific exploit \n"

Individual threat identification strategies (injury argument, entry point argument, threat argument, and vulnerability argument) all provide unique perspectives on threat. Assurance of threat identification is done by cross-correlating the results of these approaches. In addition, the identified components of threats are linked to the system elements, which allows for additional cross-correlation. (If a certain system element is associated with one of the threat components, are all similar elements also associated with threat components?) An additional backing argument is based on using qualified and experienced personnel to perform threat identification . The threat identification activity involves verification and validation tasks, as well as the assurance task. For example, in Table 1 the threat identification activity (TIA) is summarized as consisting of the following steps: Read full chapter Prospects for the Future of Data Mining and Text Mining as Part of Our Everyday Lives Robert Nisbet , ... Gary Miner , in  Handbook of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining Applications , 2009 Image and Object Data Mining Image and object data mining include visualization, 3D medical scanning and visual–photo movement analysis for development of better physical therapy procedures, security threat identifications , and other areas. As we pointed out in Chapter 8 , this is an area of current research involving development of new and modified algorithms that can better deal with the complexities of three-dimensional object identification. What is now called “visual object analysis” offers a better solution. Visual object analysis started in the late 1990s but has really developed during the first few years of the twenty-first century because: • Machine learning methods offer greater accuracy in object identification; and • Large amounts of training data are now available (computer storage space is now not a problem). The problem in this area of object category recognition is simply: humans can recognize objects—whether people, animals, rocks, or stars in the sky—better than computers; in fact, this has been a very difficult problem for computers. But in the past few years, researchers at several places, notably the University of California–Berkeley, Yahoo!, Google, and California Institute of Technology, have developed newer modified data mining algorithms that have gone from 16% recognition of objects in their 2004 work to 90% correct object category recognition in 2008, with a selected number of objects, using the following algorithms: • Nonlinear kernelized SVM (slower but more accurate) • Boosted trees (works slowly) • Linear SVM (fast but not accurate) • Intersection kernels in SVM (improved to 90% correct object category recognition in 2008) Today, 100 objects can be categorized with the methods listed here, but we need to go to several levels of magnitude larger for these methods to be fully successful in accurately recognizing images for such things as national security surveillance and precise medical identification of conditions when using three-dimensional imaging procedures. Let's examine several areas and ways of looking at the problem of visualization by computer technology and data mining analysis for fields needing high levels of accuracy by actually looking at several visual scenarios ( Figure 21.3 ). Figure 21.3 . Object categorization (OC) versus objection identification (OID). According to Ferencz et al. (2008) : This figure highlights the different learning involved in categorization and identification. The training sets for object categorization, shown on the left side, typically contain many examples of each category (e.g. faces and cars), which are then turned into a fixed model for each in a generative system, or a decision boundary in a discriminative system. A training set for object identification, on the other hand, contains pairs of images from a known category, with a label of “same” or “different” (denoted by = and ≠ in the figure) for each pair. From these labeled pairs, the system must learn how to generate an object instance identifier given a single image of a new object (e.g. Mr. Carter) from the category. For these identifiers to work well, they should highlight distinctive regions of the object. That is, the identifiers should be different for each object. The statistical methods used in the study of object categorization versus object identification shown in Figure 21.3 used discriminate analysis methods, not the Fast Intersection Support Vector Machine methods that have been shown in 2008 to be more accurate in object identification. Nevertheless, the figure shows some of the types of problems involved in accurately getting computers and software to identify visual objects, including medical objects both for diagnosis and medical delivery. Briefly, the four illustrations in Figure 21.4 , each a visual object dataset, are defined as follows: Figure 21.4 . Data sets: (A) MNIST, (B) USPS, (C) CUReT, (D) Caltech-101. (See the companion site that accompanies this book for the complete pdf document where these four illustrations, A, B, C, and D are fully explained in the following source: Figure 2 in http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/shape/nhz-cvpr06.pdf ) A The MINIST dataset is a set of handwritten digits from two populations, one U.S. Census Bureau employees and the other high school students. B The USPS dataset contains handwritten digits collected from mail envelopes in Buffalo, NY. C The CURTeT dataset contains images of 61 real-world textures, like leather, rabbit fur, sponge, etc. D The Caltech-101 dataset consists of images from 101 object categories and an additional “background class” for a total of 102 classes. There are significant differences in color and lighting which make this dataset quite challenging. The next illustration for this object identification–visual data mining, shown in Figure 21.5 , comes from work at the University of California–Berkeley and Yahoo! on what is called a fast intersection kernel Support Vector Machine algorithm . This is an SVM algorithm that has been modified to give about 90% accuracy in object identification of 100 objects, obtained during the summer of 2008 ( Maji et al., 2008 ). We won't go into details here, but for those interested, this entire paper with further information can be found on the companion site that goes with this book. Figure 21.5 . As reported in Maji et al. (2008) : “Top two rows are a sample of errors on the INRIA pedestrian data set and the bottom two are on the Daimler-Chrysler data set. For each set the first row is a sample of the false negatives, while the second row is a sample of the false positives.” ( Source:  Maji et al., 2008 .) The fast interaction SVM program, both as C++ and as source code, is available at the following web site: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smaji/projects/fiksvm/ (on the companion site that accompanies this book, see the file named berkeley - visual object recognition_fast intersection kernel svms_source code - illustrations.doc in the folder named pdfs – extra datasets – powerpoints etc .). Visual data mining—including its extension into movement modeling, e.g., slices of a moving object such as frames of a motion picture, successive slices of a body scan, or specialized frames/segments of movement in physical therapy—could lead to much more accurate identification of disease states or security threat detections, or more effective physical therapy or athletic training regimens, among other domains. The possibilities to accomplish this will be available with STATISTICA Data Miner Version 9 combined 32 bit/64 bit software. Version 8 is included on the companion site that accompanies this book; Version 9 will not be released until after this book is published. Visual Data Preparation for Data Mining: Taking Photos, Moving Pictures, and Objects into Spreadsheets Representing the Photos, Moving Pictures, and Objects A photo, illustration, graph, or any kind of object can be imported into a data spreadsheet and subsequently analyzed with any of the algorithms available in either the traditional statistics arsenal or the data mining algorithm group. Each pixel point in the photo/object becomes a data point in the spreadsheet. Let's look at an example to see how this is accomplished. The photo we will be using for an example is shown in Figure 21.6 . Figure 21.6 . This is the CD cover photograph from co-author Gary Miner's son, Matt Miner's GHOSTS Christmas album, 2008. In STATISTICA , open the File pull-down menu and select Import Picture, as shown in Figure 21.7 . Figure 21.7 . Importing the picture. Pull down the File menu, and choose Import Picture to open a dialog which can access picture files. Then find a diagram, photo, graph, or other object that you'd like to import into a spreadsheet with each cell in the spreadsheet representing one pixel in the photograph; thus, if you have a 16-bit photo, you'll have a 16-columns by 16-cases spreadsheet, and so on. Now, click on the photo file name in the Open dialog box, and then click Open in the lower right of the dialog, as shown in Figure 21.8 . Figure 21.8 . Locating the files to open. Notice the two JPEG files named Bob Nisbet and GHOSTS Christmas Album. We will be opening the GHOSTS Christmas Album to import into a pixel spreadsheet. Then the spreadsheet shown in Figure 21.9 appears. It is a 1600-variables by 1200-cases spreadsheet; i.e., this was a 1600 by 1200 pixel photo. Figure 21.9 . Spreadsheet showing pixel numbers representing the picture of the cover of the GHOSTS CD Album. Then open the Graphs pull-down menu and select 3D Sequential Graphs and then Raw Data Plots, as shown in Figure 21.10 . Figure 21.10 . Opening the Raw Data Plots. On the Advanced tab of the Raw Data Plots dialog, select Contour/Discrete in the Graph Type box, as shown in Figure 21.11 . Figure 21.11 . Selecting graph type. Then click on the Variables button at the top of the dialog to open the Select Variables dialog shown in Figure 21.12 . Figure 21.12 . Selecting variables in the plot. Next, click the Select All button to select all the variables and click OK to get a graphical representation of the photo pixel spreadsheet. These examples illustrate just the beginning of working with this technology. Here is what is exciting: you can take things like the following and put each of them into a spreadsheet: 1 Sequential MRI slices or images through the brain or any body part; 2 Movies or individual frames; 3 Any kind of sequential movement. Then you can analyze these combined spreadsheets to follow, for example, (1) proper physical therapy movements to rejuvenate an injured limb, (2) security screening, and (3) all kinds of object identification problems. The main use case would be to take the data matrices and do something important with them. For example, you might want to take a graph, reduce it to a more simple size graphically (shrink it perhaps to 300 × 300 or so) and then perform data reduction on it. In general, you now have a way to turn pictures into numbers; what you do with those numbers is a different question because almost any kind of analysis is possible. Perhaps the Kernel SVM algorithm mentioned previously from the University of California–Berkeley and California Institute of Technology might be one useful tool for specific applications. In conclusion for this section on visual object recognition by data mining technology, we can say that shape-based object recognition is one key for the future in this area. It will not only involve visual object recognition, but will have to be extended to such things as audio waves, brain wave mapping, and similar three-dimensional phenomena. Read full chapter Information Risk Assessment Timothy Virtue , Justin Rainey , in  HCISPP Study Guide , 2015 Threat Sources Organizations need to determine which types of threat sources are to be considered during risk assessments. Organizations make explicit the process used to identify threats and any assumptions related to the threat identification process. If such information is identified during the risk framing step and included as part of the organizational risk management strategy, the information need not be repeated in each individual risk assessment. Risk assessments can address all types of threat sources, a single broad threat source (e.g., adversarial) or a specific threat source (e.g., trusted insider). Read full chapter Time-Frequency Methods in Communications In Time-Frequency Signal Analysis and Processing (Second Edition) , 2016 13.5.1  Radio-Monitoring Problem Radio monitoring for military and regulatory organizations involves the scanning of a radio-frequency band, measurement of signal strength, estimation of modulation parameters and classification, geolocating of emitters, and threat identification applicable to both radar and digital communication [ 32 , p. 112]. Figure 13.5.1 shows the block diagram for a typical radio-monitoring system. Radio identification-based sensing in cognitive radio performs the radio-monitoring tasks by identifying the transmission used [ 33 ]. Frequency-shift keying (FSK) signals are chosen because they are widely used in digital communication and radar. This section deals with the stage “signal processing” in Fig. 13.5.1 and focuses on classifying FSK signals based on their modulation parameters. Besides digital communication, FSK signals are also used for Costas-coded signaling for pulse compression radar [ 34 , p. 8.1]. In radio monitoring, FSK signal characteristics such as modulation parameters, symbol rate, and frequency deviation are assumed unknown and analysis methods must be applied to estimate them. In this section, a time-frequency ( t , f )approach is used for this purpose via instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation. For the other common modulation techniques such as phase-shift keying (PSK) or multiple carrier modulation, the ( t , f ) approach is still applicable to estimate the frequency content, but the instantaneous information-bearing phase is not represented. Figure 13.5.1 . Block diagram of a radio-monitoring system [ 32 ]. 13.5.1.1  Radio communications signal model An FSK signal is characterized by a frequency transition corresponding to change in the symbol representation. The signal is modeled as a sum of N short-duration complex exponential signals defined as [ 35 ] (13.5.1) z ( t ) = A ∑ k = 0 N − 1 e j 2 π f k ( t − k T b ) rect t − ( k + 1 2 ) T b T b , where k represents the order of the information-bearing symbol, A is a constant amplitude, f k is the frequency, T b is the symbol duration (where “ b ” stands for “bit”) and rect(.) represents the rectangular or box function. The actual signal parameters are described in Table 13.5.1 and the variation in the frequency f k depends on the information-bearing symbol ( f k for binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK) can either be equal to f b 1 or f b 0 and for 4-frequency-shift keying (4FSK) can be equal to any combination of frequency f b 0 , f b 1 , f b 2 , or f b 3 ). Table 13.5.1 . Parameters of the Binary and 4FSK Signals (Sampling Rate 1 Hz) Signal Frequency (Hz) Within a Symbol Duration T b Symbol Duration (s) BFSK f b 1 = 0.1875 for symbol “1” 80 f b 0 = 0.25 for symbol “0” 4FSK 0.125 ≤ f k ≤ 0.3125, δf =0.0625 80 f b 0 = 0.125 for symbol “00” f b 1 = 0.1875 for symbol “01” f b 2 = 0.25 for symbol “11” f b 3 = 0.3125 for symbol “10” The frequency deviation (minimal difference between permitted frequencies) is 0.0625Hz in both cases. We assume that received radio-frequency (RF) signals are down-converted to the intermediate frequency band and sampled at the Nyquist rate to obtain the discrete-time representation. Unless stated otherwise, “frequency” means intermediate frequency of the received signal, normalized to the sampling rate 1 Hz. Noise affects the IF estimates. The noisy received signal can be modeled as (13.5.2) y ( t ) = z ( t ) + ϵ ( t ) , where z ( t ) is the signal defined in Eq. ( 13.5.1 ) and ϵ ( t ) is a complex-valued additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) process of independent and identically distributed real and imaginary parts with total variance σ ϵ 2 and zero mean. 13.5.1.2  Relevance of time-frequency analysis As defined in Eq. ( 13.5.1 ), an FSK signal has frequency components that vary with the transmitted symbol. As shown in Part I , a quadratic time-frequency distribution (QTFD) allows better estimation of the true signal characteristics (see Chapter 3 ). The IF estimated from the peak of the ( t , f ) representation is important for FSK signals since the information is carried within the frequency. Two general approaches for classifying digitally modulated signals such as FSK are decision theoretic [ 36 ] and pattern recognition [ 37 ]. The decision theoretic approach based on detection theory requires prior knowledge of the possible class of signals. The pattern recognition approach requires a signal representation from which the modulation parameters are estimated and used to classify the signals. If the signal is unknown, the signal representation can be used to analyze the signal and estimate its modulation parameters. Time-frequency analysis can provide signal representation in the pattern-recognition approach as shown in Ref. [ 38 ]. With efficient estimation of the IF from the ( t , f ) representation [ 39 ], accurate estimation of modulation parameters results in a high classification rate. An example of ( t , f ) representation of a nonstationary signal is given in Fig. 2.3.2 , p. 90, which shows the spectrogram of a linear FM signal for three different window lengths. Obtaining an accurate ( t , f ) representation from the spectrogram, the most common TFD, involves a compromise between time resolution and frequency resolution ( Section 2.3.2 ). Another method, the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), defined in Eq. ( 2.1.17 ), p. 78, is formed by the Fourier transform (FT) of the instantaneous autocorrelation function (IAF). The cross-term problem in the WVD is described for FSK signals in Ref. [ 35 ] and for similar signals, such as frequency-hopping signals, in Ref. [ 40 ].

In particular, we describe the concept of operations and the security policy of the system using SBVR; highlight the threat identification and the architecture descriptions of the system; and develop fragments of the assurance case, focusing on one security requirement. The case study demonstrates the linguistic analysis of the security requirement, identification of the key characteristics, and development of the portion of the assurance argument based on these characteristics down to the level of simple queries to the KDM fact-oriented repository, from which the evidence is obtained. Additional illustrations for the case study are provided in Chapter 11 , explaining the individual KDM viewpoints.

Joshua Feldman , in  CISSP Study Guide (Third Edition) , 2016 The Risk Management Process The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published Special Publication 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems (see http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf ). The guide describes a 9-step Risk Analysis process: 1. System Characterization 2. Threat Identification 3. Vulnerability Identification 4. Control Analysis 5. Likelihood Determination 6. Impact Analysis 7. Risk Determination 8. Control Recommendations 9. Results Documentation We have covered these steps individually; let us end this section by following NIST’s process. System characterization describes the scope of the risk management effort and the systems that will be analyzed. The next two steps, Threat Identification and Vulnerability Identification, identify the threats and vulnerabilities, required to identify risks using the “Risk = Threat × Vulnerability” formula. Step 4, Control Analysis, analyzes the security controls (safeguards) that are in place or planned to mitigate risk. Steps 5 and 6, Likelihood Determination and Impact Analysis, are needed to identify important risks (especially those with the high likelihood and high impact/consequence). The previous 7 steps are used to determine Control Recommendations, or the risk mitigation strategy. That strategy is documented in the final step, Results Documentation.

The risk determination and control recommendations that are output from the risk assessment will directly help to mitigate risks. ▪ System characterization ▪ Threat identification ▪ Vulnerability identification ▪ Control analysis ▪ Likelihood determination ▪ Impact analysis ▪ Risk determination ▪ Control recommendations ▪ Results documentation Although the risks and recommendations should be clearly defined as a result of the assessment, they will only help to mitigate the risks by providing a list of what needs to be fixed. The actual work of remediating the risks may be considerably more difficult than simply constructing a list of problem areas. Often mitigation of risk will involve working with teams outside of information security or even outside of information technology entirely, and may be a very involved process.

Knapp , Joel Thomas Langill , in  Industrial Network Security (Second Edition) , 2015 Threat Vectors The Threat Vector identifies the method by which the threat source will impact the target. This directly corresponds to the Entry Points in the context of the methodology established in this section. The reason for introducing the concept of an Entry Point as a means of identifying Threat Vectors is that it provides a mechanism of looking beyond traditional IT access mechanisms (e.g. USB flash drives and networks) and introduces more of the human factor including the use of policies and procedures. Entry Points are also intentionally identified before diving into the threat identification phase to allow individuals to consider less obvious mechanisms (e.g. an unused wireless LAN adapter). The establishment of the Trust Boundary provides a vital role of scoping and limiting the potential Entry Points or vectors entering a zone. Consider as an example an industrial network that is connected to the business network via a firewall. The entry point into the ICS in this case is the network connection through the firewall. The business network on the other hand, will have its own set of Entry Points and Threat Vectors that could potentially allow unauthorized access from untrusted zones (i.e. the Internet) to the trusted business zones. This is not in scope when evaluating the Entry Point into the ICS zones. What this has effectively done is consider unauthorized external traffic on the business network the same as authorized local traffic, since the security controls used on the conduit into the ICS (the firewall in this case) must handle all traffic accordingly. This approach provides necessary resilience when unauthorized external actors have masqueraded as potentially trusted insiders. Table 8.10 provides basic guidance on the selection of possible ICS Entry Points and Threat Vectors. Read full chapter Introduction John R.

Effectively communicate information security issues Read full chapter FAIR Terminology Jack Freund , Jack Jones , in  Measuring and Managing Information Risk , 2015 Threat agent library A TAL is a collection of information about TComs that was first described by Matthew Rosenquist at Intel in his whitepaper called “Prioritizing Information Security Risks with Threat Agent Risk Assessment.” 1 In that document, the author describes the construction of a table that he calls the Threat Agent Library. It’s really little more than a table for various attributes associated with the lists of threat agents. It is a great technique for articulating the differences between threats. In FAIR, we advocate the creation of standard templates for threat identification and, further, the creation of standard ranges for two of the FAIR threat factors (TEF and threat capability). There are two factors to consider when building out a TAL. First, there is the need to create a common list of relevant TComs for the organization and default values for their variables. This provides a common base from which all analysts can begin their analysis. We say begin, because the second factor to consider is that the default values will very often need to be adjusted based on the scenario under analysis. We offer a caution here. We have seen some analysts rely completely on the default values and not make the scenario-based adjustments. This isn’t a good idea. In fact, it is the opposite of a good idea. The default values and the rationale behind them are a starting point to help analysts break any analytical inertia they might struggle with when starting an analysis. They also act as a landmark so that any extreme variation in estimates is easier to recognize and validate. An organization that has fully deployed and integrated FAIR risk assessment into its environment may be conducting dozens of analyses a month. The level of quality amongst these will naturally vary (as all work products do). Building these values in a TAL \n"

No. 11/482,934, filed Jul. 10, 2006, entitled “GEOGRAPHICAL INTRUSION MAPPING SYSTEM USING TELECOMMUNICATION BILLING AND INVENTORY SYSTEMS,” which itself is a continuation-in-part of prior co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/916,873, filed Aug. 12, 2004, entitled “GEOGRAPHICAL INTRUSION RESPONSE PRIORITIZATION MAPPING SYSTEM,” and prior co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/916,872, filed Aug. 12, 2004, entitled “GEOGRAPHICAL VULNERABILITY MITIGATION RESPONSE MAPPING SYSTEM.” The contents of all the aforementioned applications are fully incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.   BACKGROUND     When a threat in a computer or telecommunications systems is discovered, response resources must be directed to a physical location of the equipment associated with the threat. In practice, this requires extensive efforts to correlate existing threat information, router traffic information and physical location of the router and impacted/suspect device, dramatically reducing response time. For example, today, most responses to an intrusion require manual review of information such as TCP/IP switch logs, call data records, advanced intelligent network logs, etc., with the subsequent manual drawing of network “maps” and, most importantly, trying to mitigate an intrusion in a sequential or business prioritization order while these efforts are being undertaken. These response schemes do not allow for an organization's management to easily identify the geographical location of the threat(s) and the location(s) at which resources are most needed. Furthermore, current response schemes do not allow an organization's response or management team timely access to geographical view(s) of the location of the threats together with information relating to the status or progress of the response to the threats.      In one instance, a digital or cyber threat may take the form of a direct attack, an introduction of malicious software such as virus and worm, or other intrusion generated by a computing device incorporating or being able to be located by one or more Global Positioning System (“GPS”) receivers. Accordingly, a PDA, a Smartphone, or a laptop with embedded and/or integrated GPS capabilities can be a source of a computer-originated attack, for example, a computer-triggered attack to remotely activate explosives. Likewise, certain wireless devices may be able to be located with some degree of specificity either through embedded GPS receivers or through GPS receivers incorporated into the towers/antennas that such devices access during an uplink. Both, a device having an incorporated GPS receivers and a device able to be located using stationary GPS receivers are referred to herein as a “GPS Device.”      A GPS device may be used to trigger a computer-originated attack in many ways. In one scenario, a GPS device may initiate a computer-originated attack directly, for example, by starting a digital or cyber attack. Alternatively, a GPS device, when vulnerable, may be at the receiving end of a first digital or cyber attack. Once the vulnerable GPS device is compromised, it may then fall under the influence of the first digital or cyber attack and initiate a computer-originated attack.      Fortunately, a GPS device may capture its location information via a protocol such as National Marine Electronics Association (“NMEA”) 0183 . The captured location information can then be transmitted via another protocol such as TCP or UDP to an incident response environment. For example, an existing security software vendor, such as Antivirus, may identify a digital or cyber attack, detect that the device is also receiving GPS information, and subsequently transmit the attack information and GPS information back to an incident response environment.      Response resources can be directed to a physical location of a GPS device under attack. In practice, however, this requires extensive efforts to correlate existing threat data or vulnerability data with GPS data collected and subsequently transmitted, thus reducing response time similar to a physical disaster or attack. So, even with the availability of GPS data, most current responses to an intrusion or vulnerability require manual review of TCP/IP switch information, manual drawing of network “maps” and, most importantly, trying to mitigate an intrusion or vulnerability in a sequential order, as described above.      In other instances, the hacking of networks such as those now ubiquitous in billing and financial systems, viruses launched against computer systems, intrusions onto computer hosts and networks, fraudulent activities resulting in the theft of services such as telephone service (wired or wireless), cable television, Internet access, etc. are just a few examples of more technologically-sophisticated crimes that are not easily mapped to a physical location.      Businesses and organizations have also used technology in an attempt to thwart these technologically-advanced crimes. One method is through the detection of anomalies in data associated with business transactions, such as the detection of unauthorized or malicious users on computer hosts and networks, often called intrusion detection and fraud detection systems.      For example, computer applications are created having several layers with each layer including detective, preventive, and corrective controls. At the business transaction layer, the detective controls apply business rules used for supervisory type reports that may be voluminous depending upon the nature of the business and the number of transactions occurring. Though there may exist a geographical correlation between physical, network and computer-related crimes, such correlation may not be apparent from review of numerous discrete reports from various sources and of varying types and formats while simultaneously trying to mitigate the crime and respond to them.      These response schemes do not allow for an organization's management to easily identify the geographical location of the problem(s) and the location(s) at which resources are most needed. Furthermore, current response schemes do not allow an organization's response or management team timely access to geographical view(s) of the location of the crimes together with information relating to the status or progress of the response to the threat.

As used herein, a “fraud” is an unauthorized use of an electronic network to use deception to obtain a service, good or other thing of value from another in reliance upon the deception.      As used herein, an “intrusion” is an unauthorized use, attempt, or successful entry into a digital, computerized, or automated system, requiring a response from a human administrator or response team to mitigate any damage or unwanted consequences of the entry. For example, the introduction of a virus and the unauthorized entry into a system by a hacker are each “intrusions” within the spirit of the present invention. An “intrusion response” is a response by systems or human operators to limit or mitigate damage from the intrusion or prevent future intrusions. Within the spirit and scope of the present invention, “intrusions” of many types and natures are contemplated.      In addition, as used herein, a “vulnerability” is a prospective intrusion, that is, a location in a digital, computerized, or automated system, at which an unauthorized use, attempt, or successful entry is possible or easier than at other points in the system. For example, a specific weakness may be identified in a particular operating system, such as Microsoft's Windows™ operating system when running less than Service Pack 6. Then, all computers running the Windows operating system with less than Service Pack 6 will therefore have this vulnerability. This and other vulnerabilities may be identified by commercially available software products. While methods of locating such vulnerabilities are outside the scope of the present invention, any of the vulnerabilities identified or located by such software products, now known or later developed, are within the spirit of the present invention.      In addition, as used herein, a “mitigation response” is the effort undertaken to reduce unwanted consequences or to eliminate the intrusion. For example, such a response may entail sending a human computer administrator to the site of the location to update software, install anti-virus software, eliminate a virus, or perform other necessary tasks. In addition, a response may entail installing a patch to the vulnerable computer, such as across a network. The present invention does not contemplate any specific responses. Instead, any response to an intrusion requiring the organization of resources is within the scope and spirit of the present invention.      For the ease of discussion, the following discussion will focus on the systems and methods of the present invention in terms of mapping “threats.” Reference to “threats” includes frauds, intrusions and vulnerabilities. Similarly, subsequent reference to “intrusions” includes both intrusions and vulnerabilities as described above.       FIG. 1 is a block diagram of one exemplary environment in which the systems and methods of the present invention may be implemented. As shown in FIG. 1 , system 100 employs mapping computer 102 . In addition, system 100 may also employ databases such as threat database 104 , telecommunications call (or call detail record (CDR)) database 106 , location database 108 , and map database 110 , each in electronic communication with mapping computer 102 . System 100 also includes a display 114 , such as a video display, for displaying the geographic information correlated and mapped by computer 102 using the methods discussed herein, and a network 112 , in electronic communication with computer 102 , in which the threats may occur.      In one embodiment, threat database 104 may contain information identifying a threat in the system, such as, for example, the threat type, description, and point of possible entry or exit (i.e., network point or computer). As shown in FIG. 1A , CDR database 106 for a plain old telephone service (POTS) may contain records identifying a plurality of telecommunications calls by date/time, duration, tariff cost, originating and terminating telephone numbers and switch identification. In instances in which the CDR database stores information related to telecommunications calls supported by a cellular or other wireless network, the CDR records may also include wireless location data, such as location data associated with the cellular tower servicing the telecommunications call or GPS data provided by a mobile terminal that originates or receives the telecommunications call. See, for example, FIG. 5 which illustrates other CDR records for telecommunications calls supported by a cellular or other wireless network. Location database 108 may contain geographical information such as the physical address or wireless location, e.g., GPS, coordinates of a potential point of entry or exit. Finally, map database 110 may correlate and contain information from the threat, CDR, and location databases as described below to map the threats.       FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary mapping computer 102 for use in system 100 , consistent with the present invention. Computer 102 includes a bus 202 or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a processor 204 coupled to bus 202 for processing information. Computer 102 also includes a main memory, such as a random access memory (RAM) 206 , coupled to bus 202 for storing information and instructions during execution by processor 204 . RAM 206 also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor 204 . Computer system 102 further includes a read only memory (ROM) 208 or other storage device coupled to bus 202 for storing static information and instructions for processor 204 . A mass storage device 210 , such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus 202 for storing information and instructions.      Computer 102 may be coupled via bus 202 to a display 212 , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a computer user. Display 212 may, in one embodiment, operate as display 114 .      Computer 102 may further be coupled to an input device 214 , such as a keyboard, coupled to bus 202 for communicating information and command selections to processor 204 . Another type of user input device is a cursor control 216 , such as a mouse, a trackball or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor 204 and for controlling cursor movement on display 212 . Cursor control 216 typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), which allow the device to specify positions in a plane.      According to one embodiment, computer 102 executes instructions for geographic mapping of threat information. Either alone or in combination with another computer system, computer 102 thus permits the geographic mapping of threats in response to processor 204 executing one or more sequences of instructions contained in RAM 206 . Such instructions may be read into RAM 206 from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device 210 . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in RAM 206 causes processor 204 to perform the functions of mapping computer 102 , and/or the process stages described herein. In an alternative implementation, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus, implementations consistent with the principles of the present invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.      The term “computer-readable medium” as used herein refers to any media that participates in providing instructions to processor 204 for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device 210 . Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as RAM 206 . Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus 202 . Transmission media may also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red data communications.      Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, RAM, PROM, EPROM, FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer may read. For the purposes of this discussion, carrier waves are the signals which carry the data to and from computer 102 .      Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor 204 for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on the magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer may load the instructions into a dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer 102 may receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector coupled to bus 202 may receive the data carried in the infra-red signal and place the data on bus 202 . Bus 202 carries the data to main memory 206 , from which processor 204 retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory 206 may optionally be stored on storage device 210 either before or after execution by processor 204 .      Computer 102 may also include a communication interface 218 coupled to bus 202 . Communication interface 218 provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link 220 that may be connected to network 112 . Network 112 may be a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or any other network configuration. For example, communication interface 218 may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. Computer 102 may communicate with a host 224 via network 112 . As another example, communication interface 218 may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface 218 sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.      Network link 220 typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. In this embodiment, network 112 may communicate with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) 226 . For example, network link 220 may provide a connection to data equipment operated by the ISP 226 . ISP 226 , in turn, provides data communication services from another server 230 or host 224 to computer 102 . Network 112 may use electric, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams.      Computer 102 may send messages and receive data, including program code, through network 112 , network link 220 and communication interface 218 . In this embodiment, server 230 may download an application program to computer 102 via network 112 and communication interface 218 . Consistent with the present invention, one such downloaded application geographically maps vulnerability or threat information, such as, for example, by executing methods 300 and/or 900 , to be described below in reference to FIGS. 3 and 9 . The received code may be executed by processor 204 as it is received and/or stored in storage device 210 , or other non-volatile storage for later execution.      Although computer system 102 is shown in FIG. 2 as connectable to server 230 , those skilled in the art will recognize that computer system 102 may establish connections to multiple servers on Internet 228 and/or network 112 . Such servers may include HTML-based Internet applications to provide information to computer system 102 upon request in a manner consistent with the present invention.      Returning to FIG. 1 , display 114 may, in one embodiment, be implemented as display 212 ( FIG. 2 ), directly connected to computer 102 . In an alternative embodiment, display 114 may be connected to computer 102 via network 112 . For example, display 114 may be a display connected to another computer on network 112 , or may be a stand-alone display device such as a video projector connected to computer 102 via network 112 .      In addition, databases 104 , 106 , 108 , and 110 may each reside within computer 102 or may reside in any other location, such as on network 112 , so long as they are in electronic communication with computer 102 .      In one embodiment, location database 108 is a static database in which the physical location of routers or network points is located. Such location information may include router (IP/MAC) address, and router (or network point) physical address (geographic location), such as GPS coordinates. The CDR database 106 and location database 108 may be kept in accordance with any now known or later developed methods for implementing and maintaining call detail records, or physical location information, respectively.      In an alternative embodiment, databases 104 , 106 , 108 , and 110 , may be implemented as a single database, or may be implemented as any number of databases. For example, system 100 may include multiple threat, CDR, location, and map databases. Furthermore, in one embodiment, databases 104 , 106 , 108 , and 110 may be implemented as a single database containing all of the described information. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that system 100 may include any number (one or more) of databases so long as the information discussed herein may be retrieved and correlated as discussed herein.      Finally, databases 104 , 106 , 108 , and 110 may be implemented using any now known or later developed database schemes or database software. For example, in one embodiment, each of the databases may be implemented using a relational database scheme, and/or may be built using Microsoft Access™ or Microsoft Excel™ software. While, more likely, one or more databases will be implemented to take into account other factors outside the scope of the present invention, any implementation (and location) of the present databases is contemplated within the scope and spirit of the present invention.       FIG. 3 shows a method 300 for execution, such as by computer 102 , for geographic mapping of threat information, consistent with one embodiment of the present invention. Method 300 begins by receiving threat information, stage 302 , such as from a computer administrator, as the output of software designed to detect threats, from a threat detection system, router, network management system, security information manager, or from any other source. In one embodiment, the threat information may include an identification (such as the IP address) of the computer where the threat started or ended, the name and description of the threat, and possibly other data. Upon receipt of the threat information, it is stored in threat database 104 at stage 304 . FIG. 4 shows one embodiment of threat information 400 within threat database 104 .      Returning to FIG. 3 , in instances in which the computer where the threat started or ended is a computer that is configured to communicate via cellular or other wireless networks, computer 102 then retrieves, for computers or network points (hereinafter generally referenced as “computers”) at which a threat started or ended, CDR information for that computer from CDR database 106 , at stage 306 . In one embodiment, the threat information (such as the IP address) may be used as a key to retrieve the appropriate record from CDR database 106 . The CDR information may include the IP address of a computer that participates in a telecommunications call, such as an exchange of messages, a transfer of data or the like, wireless location data identifying the location of the computer during a respective telecommunications call, and other information relating to the telecommunications call and/or the computer at which the threat started or ended, as necessary. As noted, the wireless location data may be location data associated with the cellular tower servicing the telecommunications call or GPS data provided by the mobile device. FIG. 5 shows one exemplary embodiment of the CDR information within CDR database 106 .      In instances in which the wireless location data identifies a cellular tower servicing the telecommunications call, computer 102 may also retrieve geographic location information for the cellular tower from location database 108 , at stage 308 . In one embodiment, the threat data (such as IP address) and/or the CDR data (such as the identification of the cellular tower) may be used as a key to identify a record corresponding to the location database record(s), corresponding to the cellular tower. The location information retrieved may include such information as the physical location (e.g., mailing address or GPS coordinates) for the identified cellular tower. FIG. 6 shows one exemplary embodiment 600 of the location information within location database 108 .      As described above and in greater detail below, the system and method of one embodiment receive threat information that includes a network address, such as an IP address, associated with a device affiliated with the threat, such as a device at which the threat began or ended, and then identify wireless location data, e.g., GPS data or data identifying a cellular tower and its location, associated with the device based upon its network address. In another embodiment, the system and method receive threat information, e.g., indicative of fraud or potential fraud, that includes the telephone number of a device affiliated with the threat, such as the calling telephone number or the called telephone number, and then identify the location of the device based upon an address associated with the telephone number in a customer database, such as a billing or inventory database.      Once this information has been retrieved from databases 104 , 106 , and 108 , it is stored in map database 110 at stage 310 . Within map database 110 , the retrieved information is preferably correlated such that all information for a particular threat is stored in a record for that threat. For example, FIG. 7 shows an exemplary screenshot 700 of records of map information for mapping threats, such as may be stored in map database 110 . As shown, map database records may contain the threat information including the network address (such as the IP address or telephone number), and the physical location, such as the mailing address (from location database 108 or a customer database) or GPS information (from CDR database 106 ). In addition, map database records may also include a status of the threat and an indication of the response person or team assigned to respond to the threat.      Upon correlating this information within map database 110 , computer 102 then maps the location of the threat at stage 312 . In one embodiment, the location information for each record is imported into a commercially available mapping program such as MapPoint™ by Microsoft, to visually locate the threat points with network 112 on a map. In one embodiment, the map may represent each of the threats as a symbol on the map, for example, as a push pin. An exemplary map 800 using this push pin approach is shown as FIG. 8 . Within map 800 , each pushpin 802 , 804 , shows the location of a point of threat requiring a response.      Using map 800 , response teams or system administrators will be able to identify “pockets” of threats and will be able to better prioritize and more efficiently schedule response personnel to respond and mitigate or eliminate the threat, based on geographic location. In addition, by continually updating the map and watching it change over time, system operators will be able to geographically view the spread, if any, of a threat. Furthermore, by also tracking system updates, the administrator will be able to identify new entry points.       FIG. 9 shows a flowchart of a method 900 for updating the geographic map with progress information. Method 900 begins with a response team or system administrator sending an update to the system to advise of a new status of a threat at stage 902 . For example, the response team may advise the system that the intruded computer must be replaced, and be rendered inactive until it is replaced, (i.e., the threat is “open”) or may advise the system that the intruded computer has been upgraded and is no longer compromised.      Once this information is received, the map database record for the identified threat is updated at stage 904 . For example, each threat record in the database may contain a field to identify the status of the threat (see FIG. 7 ). Possible status indicators may reflect that the threat is “new,” “open” (i.e., not yet responded to), “assigned to a response team,” “closed” (i.e., responded to and fixed), or any other status that may be of use to the organization for which the system has been implemented.      Once the map database record has been updated, map computer 102 can update map 800 to reflect the updated status of the threat. For example, one way that map 800 can show the status information is to display color-coded push pin symbols to reflect the status. In one embodiment, a red push pin may signify an “open” or “new” threat, a yellow push pin may signify a threat that has been assigned, but not yet fixed, and a green push pin may signify a closed threat. By mapping this information together with the locations of the threats, administrators can better track the progress of their response teams, and more fluidly schedule responses to new threats as they arise.      Any symbol or representation may be used to identify a threat on the map, including, but not limited to, a push-pin symbol. These symbols and representations may be used to identify the quantity of threats in that area of the map, such as by varying the color of the symbol to identify such quantity. In addition, the symbol or representation may be linked to the underlying data such that a user, using an input device, may select a symbol on the map causing computer 102 to display the status, quantity, address, or other information corresponding to the selected symbol.      The preferred threat mapping systems and methods may applied in various environments using various equipment and data analogous to the described above. Described below are various specific implementations thereof in the context of certain network environments.       FIG. 10 is a block diagram of a second exemplary environment 1000 in which preferred systems and methods consistent with the present invention may be implemented. The number of components in environment 1000 is not limited to what is shown and other variations in the number of arrangements of components are possible. The components of FIG. 10 may be implemented through hardware, software, and/or firmware.      As shown in FIG. 10 , environment 1000 may include a threat detection system (“TDS”) 1020 , an identification system 1030 , a location system 1040 , and a mapping system 1050 , each directly or indirectly in electronic communication with the other systems. Similarly to the environment 100 of FIG. 1 , such communication may be conducted through a network 112 as described above. Also similarly to the environment 100 of FIG. 1 , environment 1000 also includes a display device 114 , such as a video display, for displaying the geographical threat information correlated and mapped by the mapping system 1050 using the methods discussed herein.      The TDS 1020 includes various systems including, for example, firewall logs, that can provide information related to network threats, vulnerabilities or other security threats. For example, the TDS may identify attacks and contain information such as the attack type, description, and impacted device information such as a network device, e.g., an IP address, of the impacted device (e.g., a router, a connected computer). TDS 1020 may also include threat database 1022 , which stores threat information, such as the aforementioned attack-related information (e.g., threat type, threat description, and impacted device information such as a network address or telephone number of the impacted device). FIG. 4 illustrates one example of threat information 400 that may be stored in threat database 1022 . FIG. 15 illustrates a second example of threat information 1500 that may be stored in threat database 1022 . Other examples are of course possible.      Exemplary identification system 1030 may include various systems that can provide information useful for identifying network points (e.g., network equipment, connected computers, users, etc.) within environment 1000 . For example, in environment 1000 , identification system 1030 includes an authentication system 1031 . Authentication system 1031 may be implemented, for example, through the RADIUS Authentication Protocol, to verify that a user is indeed authorized to operate in environment 1000 . RADIUS is used commonly with embedded network devices such as routers, modem servers, and switches. A typical RADIUS packet includes fields such as code, identifier, length, authenticator, and attributes. In one example, a RADIUS packet may contain attributes such as username and password, which may be used to identify a particular user in the network. When a RADIUS packet is sent from a network point in a telecom system, it may also contain telephony attributes such as a calling party telephone number (e.g., “Caller ID” information).      A user or client may initiate an authentication process by sending a RADIUS Access-Request packet to a server in authentication system 1031 . The server will then process the packet and send back a response packet to the client if the server possesses a shared secret for the client. Once the authentication is confirmed by the client, authentication system 1031 may store pertinent authentication data in authentication database 1032 . Authentication data may contain, for example, an IP address, user information, caller ID information and authentication identification (e.g., crypto-keys). Authentication database 1032 thus may serve as a source for identification information for network points in environment 1000 . FIG. 16 illustrates one example of records storing authentication data 1600 in authentication database 1032 . Other examples are of course possible.      In some implementations (e.g., telecom networks), identification system 1030 may also include a call database 1033 , which may store data related to call transactions, such as calling party telephone number, called party telephone number, other network addresses associated with a caller or network equipment used in a call (e.g., MINs, IP/MAC addresses), etc. For example, in a Voice over IP system, an IP address may be associated with a conventional telephone number, in order to perform proper call routing. Call database 1033 thus may serve as a source for identification information for network points in environment 1000 . FIG. 5 illustrates one example of records storing call data in a call database 1033 . Other examples are of course possible.      Exemplary location system 1040 includes various systems that are useful in identifying physical (geographic) locations associated with network points in environment 1000 . For example, location system 1040 may include a customer database 1042 , which may contain geographical information such as the physical address or geographic coordinates (e.g., mailing address, latitude and longitude) for the customers (or other parties) that use network 112 . Information in customer database 1042 may be identified by various data that is associated with a particular customer entity, such as authentication data (illustrated in FIG. 11A as location data 1100 ), caller ID information (illustrated in FIG. 11B as location data 1101 ), a combination thereof and/or other customer-specific identifiers. Location system 1040 may also include a network element database 1043 , which may comprise the aforementioned location database 108 (see FIG. 1 , FIG. 6 ) and/or other databases that track physical locations of network switching elements.      Exemplary mapping system 1050 may be configured to correlate data from the various databases described above, and to map threats accordingly (as further described below). Mapping system 1050 may be implemented using computer 102 , map database 110 and display 114 as described above (see FIG. 2 ). Computer 102 may be configured to execute instructions that perform the various operations associated with the exemplary threat mapping processes described herein.      As was the case for environment 100 , network security system 1020 , identification system 1030 , location system 1040 and mapping system 1050 of environment 1000 may be interconnected directly or indirectly, with or without network 112 . Moreover, elements of each of these systems may be distributed across multiple computing platforms, or concentrated into only one or a few computing platforms. For example, network security system 1020 , identification system 1030 , and location system 1040 may each reside within mapping system 1050 , or may reside in any other location in any combination, so long as they are in electronic communication with mapping system 1050 . Likewise the various databases may be implemented as a single database, or may be implemented as any number of databases. For example, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that environment 1000 may include multiple authentication databases, such as having one for each geographical region served by environment 1000 . Similarly, environment 1000 may include multiple threat, authentication, call, customer location and/or mapping databases, or a single database containing all of the described information. Any implementation (and configuration) of the system environment described herein is contemplated.       FIG. 13 shows a preferred method 1300 which may be performed in conjunction with mapping system 1050 to geographically correlate and map threats in environment 1000 . Method 1300 is similar in many respects to method 300 (see FIG. 3 ), and is presented here as specifically applicable to the exemplary environment 1000 . Method 1300 begins (similarly to method 300 of FIG. 3 ) by receiving threat data at stage 1302 and recording the threat data in threat database 1022 in stage 1304 . As noted above, threat data may be any information describing or identifying a threat. Threat data can be received from a computer administrator, from the output of software designed to detect or discover threats from TDS or firewall logs, from a network management system, from a security information manager, or from any other source. FIGS. 4 and 15 illustrate examples of threat data recorded in threat database 1022 .      Returning to FIG. 13 , in stage 1305 the mapping system receives the threat data from threat database 1022 . In stage 1306 , mapping system 1050 retrieves identification information from a CDR database, such as at least one of authentication database data 1032 and call database 1033 , for those network points at which the threats started (or ended). In one embodiment, at least one part of the threat data (such as the IP address or Caller ID information) may be used as a key to retrieve the associated record(s) in authentication database 1032 and/or call database 1033 . As shown by the examples in FIGS. 5 and 16 , the retrieved identification data can include authentication identification, network address, e.g., IP address, caller ID information, and/or any other network address information of the network point at which the threat started or ended, as necessary.      At stage 1308 , mapping system 1050 retrieves geographical location data, for the computer or device at which the threat(s) started or ended, from location system 1040 . In one embodiment, at least one part of the identification data (such as authentication identification or caller ID information) may be used as a key to identify and retrieve the associated record(s) in at least one of customer database 1042 and /or network element database 1043 . The location data retrieved may include such information as the physical location (e.g., mailing address or geographic coordinates) for the identified attacked network point or device. FIGS. 6, 11A and 11 B show examples of such location data.      At stage 1310 , the retrieved data are preferably correlated such that all information for a particular threat is stored in a record or records for that threat. In one embodiment, the correlated data are stored as map data in mapping database 110 . FIG. 7 shows an example of records in mapping database 110 . As shown, mapping database records may contain the threat information, the network address (such as the IP address or telephone number), and the physical location such as the mailing address or coordinate information. In addition, mapping database records may also include a status of the threat and an indication of the response person or team assigned to respond to the threat.      Returning to FIG. 13 , at stage 1312 , mapping system 1050 maps the location of the threat. In one embodiment, the map data for each threat are imported into a commercially available mapping program such as Microsoft MapPoint™ to visually locate the threat points on a map presented on display 114 . In one embodiment, the map may represent each of the threats as a symbol on the map, for example, as a “pushpin.” An exemplary map 800 using this pushpin approach is shown in FIG. 8 . Within map 800 , each pushpin symbol 802 , 804 , shows the location of a point of threat requiring a response. The color of the pushpin symbol or representation on the map may be used to identify the quantity of threats in an area on the map, allowing the administrators to easily identify problem areas. In addition, the symbol (i.e., pushpin or other symbol) may be linked to the underlying data. For example, FIG. 12 illustrates a map 1200 , which includes description windows associated with each pushpin location 1202 , 1204 (e.g., specifying the address associated with each pushpin). In some embodiments, a system user may, using an input device, select a symbol on the map to initiate a display of data such as the threat type, network address, status of the response, or other information.       FIGS. 14A and 14B are block diagrams showing two exemplary methods for geographically mapping threats through correlation. In FIG. 14A , mapping system 1050 receives, from threat database 1022 in TDS 1020 , threat data containing, for example, one or more of a source network address such as a source IP address or a source telephone number, destination network address such as a destination IP address or a destination telephone number, and attack event name, at stage 1412 . In addition, at stage 1414 , mapping system 1050 receives identification data from a CDR database, such as the authentication database 1032 of identification system 1030 . The identification data may contain, for example, an IP address and authentication identification. At stage 1416 , mapping system 1050 receives location data from a customer database 1042 in location system 1040 . Location data may contain, for example, a telephone number and billing information such as mailing addresses. These stages, namely, 1412 , 1414 and 1416 , may take place in other sequences than described here.      After receiving threat, identification, and location data, mapping system 1050 correlates threat data and identification data with location data to generate map data. In one embodiment, mapping system 1050 joins tables from the aforementioned databases, utilizes network address as a key to identify the record(s) indicating the source or destination of the threat and the identity of the network point experiencing the threat, uses the identification data to locate associated geographic coordinates, and generates map data containing network address, attack event name, and geographic coordinates for storage in mapping database 110 . This correlation may be implemented in many other ways. At stage 1418 , mapping system 1050 generates a map displaying a geographical location of the threat(s) based on the map data from mapping database 110 .      In another embodiment, FIG. 14B shows an exemplary method where the mapping system does not communicate directly with the identification system. In FIG. 14B , identification system 1030 receives, from TDS 1020 , threat data describing or identifying the threat(s), at stage 1420 . Also at stage 1420 , identification system 1030 queries the table(s) in the authentication database 1032 , utilizing either source network address or destination network address of the threat(s) in threat database 1022 as a key to identify the record(s) containing identification information associated with the network address. At stage 1422 , location system 1040 receives identification data from identification system 1030 , and uses this data to identify the record(s) containing location data associated with the identification data from the customer database 1042 .      Mapping system 1050 receives location data from location system 1040 at stage 1424 and threat data identifying the source or destination of the threat(s) from threat database 1022 at stage 1426 . Mapping system 1050 correlates the threat data with location data and generates map data containing network address, attack event name, and geographic coordinates for storage in mapping database 110 . In one embodiment, after stage 1422 , location data contain an identifier such as network address and the correlation is implemented by matching the identifiers between location data and threat data. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that this correlation may be implemented in many ways. At stage 1428 , mapping system 1050 generates a map displaying a geographical location of the threat(s) based on the map data from mapping database 110 .      The map data in mapping database 110 may be periodically updated, as described above with respect to FIG. 9 .       FIG. 17 is a block diagram of a third exemplary environment 1700 in which preferred systems and methods consistent with the present invention may be implemented. The number of components in environment 1700 is not limited to what is shown and other variations in the number of arrangements of components are possible. The components of FIG. 17 may be implemented through hardware, software, and/or firmware.      As shown in FIG. 17 , environment 1700 may include a TDS 1020 and a mapping system 1750 similar those depicted in FIG. 10 and described above, with modifications as noted below. Also similarly to the environment 100 of FIG. 1 , environment 1700 also includes a display device 114 , such as a video display, for displaying the geographical threat information correlated and mapped by the mapping system 1750 using the methods discussed herein. Identification system 1030 and location system 1040 of FIG. 10 , although not shown in FIG. 17 , may be included in system environment 1700 in a manner similar to described above. Communication between systems in environment 1700 may be conducted through a network 112 as described above.      In addition, environment 1700 may include a mobile device 1740 , such as a GPS device, from which the network security system 1020 and/or mapping system 1750 receives wireless location data, such as GPS data in a format such as NMEA 0183 via software transmitting this data using protocols such as TCP or UDP. Mobile device 1740 may communicate with network security system 1020 and/or mapping system 1750 via one or more well known data transmission capabilities or software. While the mobile device may be embodied as a GPS-enabled device as noted above, other types of mobile devices may be employed that identify its location based upon signals transmitted by the mobile device through a wireless network. For example, the location of other types of mobile devices may be provided in relation to one or more cell towers or base stations.       FIG. 18 shows a preferred method 1800 which may be performed by mapping system 1750 to locate sources of computer-originated attacks on mobile devices. Method 1800 begins by recording threat data at stage 1802 . Similar to step 302 of method 300 , threat data may be any information describing or identifying a threat. In one embodiment, the threat data may include an identification (such as the IP address or telephone number) of the mobile device or network point where the computer-originated attack started, and the name and description of the attack event, among other information. The threat data are stored in threat database 1022 . As noted above, FIG. 5 shows one embodiment of threat data within threat database 1022 .      Returning to FIG. 18 , at stage 1804 , the threat data stored in TDS 1020 is retrieved. At stage 1806 , mapping system 1750 retrieves wireless location data for mobile devices 1740 at which the computer-originated attack(s) started. In one embodiment in which the mobile device is GPS enabled, at least one part of the threat data (such as the IP address or telephone number) may be used as a key to retrieve the appropriate wireless location record(s), such as from a CDR database in instances in which the threat data includes an IP address or a customer database in instances in which the threat data includes a telephone number. In one embodiment, the wireless location data may include IP address and location information, such as geographic coordinates, of the mobile device 1740 at which the computer-originated attack(s) started, as necessary. FIG. 20 shows one exemplary embodiment of wireless location data 2000 , which may be provided by GPS-enabled device 1740 .      Once the relevant data have been retrieved from threat database 1022 and mobile device 1740 , they may be stored in mapping system 1750 (e.g., in mapping database 1752 ). At stage 1808 , the retrieved threat data and wireless location data are preferably correlated such that all information for a particular computer-originated attack is stored in a record or records for that attack. In one embodiment, the correlated data are stored as map data in mapping database 1752 . FIG. 21 shows an exemplary embodiment of records 2100 in mapping database 1752 . As shown, mapping database records 2100 may contain attack event name, the network address (such as the IP address or telephone number from threat database 1022 ), and the physical location such as geographic coordinates (from the wireless location data provided by the mobile device 1740 ) or the billing address (from a customer database). In addition, mapping database records may also include a status of the threat and an indication of the response person or team assigned to respond to the threat.      Returning to FIG. 18 , at stage 1810 , mapping system 1750 maps the location of the source of the computer-originated attack. In one embodiment, the map data for each computer-originated attack are imported into a commercially available mapping program such as Microsoft MapPoint™ to visually locate the threat points on a map presented on display 114 . As noted above, the map may represent each of the threats as a symbol on the map, for example, as a “pushpin,” such as illustrated in FIG. 8 , where each pushpin symbol 802 , 804 , shows the location of a point of threat. As in the previously described embodiments, the mapping provided herein may allow response teams to identify “pockets” of threats and will be able to better prioritize and more efficiently schedule response personnel to respond and mitigate or eliminate the threats, based on geographical location. The map may be updated when threat information becomes updates, as noted above. In addition, due the mobile nature of GPS devices, the map may be updated at regular intervals using currently available GPS data from GPS devices 1740 .       FIGS. 19A and 19B are block diagrams showing two exemplary methods for locating a source of a computer-originated attack based on a GPS device. In the method depicted in FIG. 19A , in a stage 1912 , mapping system 1750 receives, from threat database 1022 in TDS 1020 , threat data containing, for example, source network address such as source IP address or source telephone number, destination network address such as destination IP address or destination telephone number, and attack event name. In addition, at stage 1914 , mapping system 1750 receives wireless location data from mobile device 1740 . Wireless location data contains, for example, IP address and geographic coordinates of the impacted mobile device or a cell tower or base station serving the mobile device. These stages 1912 and 1914 may take place simultaneously or in any sequence.      After receiving threat and wireless location data, mapping system 1750 correlates threat data with wireless location data to generate map data, as noted above. In one embodiment, mapping system 1750 joins tables from threat database 1022 with wireless location data, utilizes the network address in the wireless location data as a key to identify the record(s) indicating the source of the threat or computer-originated attack from threat database 1022 , and generates map data containing network address, attack event name, and geographic coordinates in mapping database 1752 . At stage 1916 , mapping system 1750 generates a map displaying a geographical location of the source of the threat(s) based on the map data from mapping database 1752 .      In the exemplary method depicted in FIG. 19B , the TDS communicates directly with the mobile device. As shown, TDS 1020 receives wireless location data describing or identifying the impacted mobile device from the mobile device 1740 at stage 1920 . Also at stage 1920 , TDS 1020 queries the table(s) in threat database 1022 , utilizing the network address associated with the wireless data as a key to identify the record(s) describing or identifying the threat(s) from threat database 1022 .      At stage 1922 , mapping system 1750 receives threat data describing or identifying the threat(s) from threat database 1022 . At stage 1924 , mapping system 1750 receives wireless location data from mobile device 1740 . Mapping system 1750 further correlates threat data with wireless location data and generates map data containing network address, attack event name, and geographic coordinates in mapping database 1752 . In one embodiment, the correlation is implemented by matching the network addresses between wireless location data and threat data, although other correlation methods are possible. At stage 1926 , mapping system 1750 generates a map displaying geographical location of the source of the threat(s) or vulnerabilit(ies) based on the map data from mapping database 1752 .      The source of a wireless (data) call may also be located based upon wireless location data. In this regard, mapping system 1750 receives, from threat database 1022 in TDS 1020 , threat data containing, for example, source network address, destination network address, and attack event name. Information about the source network address of a threat is passed from the threat database 1022 to an authentication module (e.g., RADIUS). The source network address is correlated with authentication information at the authentication module. The authentication information is then passed from the authentication module to a location information module, where the location, e.g., the GPS coordinates, of the source of the wireless call are determined, as such determinations may be made by various systems in wireless communications systems, such as by reference to a CDR database. Mapping system 1750 receives wireless location (e.g., GPS) data from location information module 1932 . Wireless location data contains, for example, IP address and geographic (GPS) coordinates of the impacted source device.      After receiving threat and wireless location data, mapping system 1750 correlates threat data with wireless location data to generate map data, as noted above. In one embodiment, mapping system 1750 joins tables from threat database 1022 with wireless location data, utilizes the network address in the wireless location data as a key to identify the record(s) indicating the source of the threat or computer-originated attack from threat database 1022 , and generates map data containing network address, attack event name, and geographic coordinates in mapping database 1752 . At stage 1926 , mapping system 1750 generates a map displaying a geographical location of the source of the threat(s) based on the map data from mapping database 1752 .       FIG. 22A is an alternative block diagram of one exemplary environment in which the systems and methods of the present invention may be implemented. As shown in FIG. 22A , system 2200 employs a computing device 2202 that may be used for mapping. Such a computing device may be one such as is shown and described in relation to FIG. 2 , above, though other computing devices capable of performing a mapping function are contemplated within the scope of this invention. In addition, the embodiment of system 2200 may also employ databases such as a threat database 2204 , a fraud database 2208 , a location database 2212 , and a mapping database 2214 , each in electronic communication with computing device 2202 . System 2200 also includes a display 2216 , such as a video display, for displaying the geographic information correlated and mapped by computing device 2202 using the methods discussed herein, and a network 2218 , in electronic communication with the computing device 2202 . The components that comprise the system 2200 communicate with one another through a network 2218 , which may be wired, wireless, optical or combinations thereof. The network 2218 is comprised of physical and virtual devices and connections and includes computer software executing on the processors of one or more computing devices, memory, firmware and the network may support one or more communications protocols such as, for example, TCP/IP.      Yet another alternative block diagram of one exemplary environment in which the systems and methods of the present invention may be implemented is shown in FIG. 22B . In FIG. 22B , one or more threat detection systems (TDSs) 2220 , such as the one described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/916,873, filed Aug. 12, 2004, entitled “GEOGRAPHICAL INTRUSION RESPONSE PRIORITIZATION MAPPING SYSTEM,” fully incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof, are used to populate a threat database 2222 . Likewise, one or more fraud detection systems (FDSs) 2224 , such as the one described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/319,608, “MULTIDIMENSIONAL TRANSACTION FRAUD DETECTION SYSTEM AND METHOD,” having as an inventor James T. McConnell and filed on Dec. 29, 2005, fully incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof,, are used to populate a fraud database 2226 . Information from each of these databases 2222 , 2226 is provided to a location/GPS engine 2230 operating on one or more processors on one or more computing devices. Information provided to the location/GPS engine 2230 may include, for example, data related to the nature of the threat and information from which a location may be determined such as, for example, an IP address, a telephone number, a street address, etc. The location/GPS engine 2230 receives the provided database information and, if a more accurate location is needed or if the provided address is to be verified or correlated with other location information, the location/GPS engine 2230 accesses a location database 2232 . The location database 2232 may be comprised of a number of separate databases or it may be an amalgamation of information from various sources and databases into one database. In one exemplary embodiment, the location database 2232 may be comprised of an inventory database 2234 that includes information about telecommunications and network equipment and the location of such equipment; a billing database 2236 that includes information about billing addresses for telecommunications, ISP, CATV or other system, network or services subscribers; a RADIUS database 2238 , which is further described herein; and a GPS database 2252 , which provides GPS location information (e.g., coordinates) of devices containing GPS receivers that access a network or the location of devices that access one or more GPS-enabled devices. It is to be appreciated that this is just one embodiment of a location database and it is contemplated under the scope of this invention that location databases comprised of different, more, fewer and different combinations of databases or sources of location information are contemplated.      From the location database 2232 , the location/GPS engine 2230 determines a physical location or coordinates (e.g., GPS-latitude and longitude, horizontal and vertical, etc.) for the threat information received from one or both of the threat database 2222 and the fraud database 2226 or any other threat database. The data related to the nature of the threat and its associated location or coordinate information is then provided to a mapping database 2246 , where it is stored and may be accessed by a mapping computer product operating computing device 2248 and graphically displayed on a display 2250 .      As previously described, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/319,608 describes one method of determining fraud in transactions. Another method of detecting fraud in telecommunications transactions and activities is through the monitoring of call detail records (CDRs) or advanced intelligent network (AIN) information. FIG. 23A is block diagram of one exemplary environment in which the systems and methods of fraud detection in a telecommunications system may be implemented. As shown in FIG. 23A , the CDR/AIN 2302 is comprised of computer records containing data unique to a specific call. The information is processed as a unit and may contain details such as, for example, an originating switch, an originating telephone number, a terminating switch, a terminating telephone number, call length, time of day, etc. CDRs and AIN records are known in the art and one or both are used by most telecommunications providers. Telecommunications providers employ FDSs 2304 to monitor and analyze the CDR/AIN 2302 for activities and patterns of activities or characteristics that are indicative of fraudulent activities based on known fraudulent behavior and the business rules of the organization. Generally, FDSs 2304 are computer algorithms implemented on computing device as large amounts of data is reviewed. FDSs 2304 are generally known in the art by those of ordinary skill. In other instances the review of the CDR/AIN 2302 may be performed manually.      Based on the application of the FDS 2304 to the CDR/AIN 2302 , or manual review of the CDR/AIN 2302 , a fraud detection log is created and stored in a fraud database 2306 . The fraud database 2306 includes at least some information about the suspected fraudulent activity or complaint (or a code that corresponds to a description of the suspected fraudulent activity in a table), and one or more telephone numbers suspected of involvement in the potentially fraudulent activity. An exemplary database record for a fraud database 2306 is shown in FIG. 23B showing a complaint description 2320 and a telephone number 2322 associated with that complaint. It also includes an identifier 2324 that indicates whether the telephone number 2322 is an originating telephone number or a terminating telephone number. It is to be appreciated that the telephone number 2322 shown in FIG. 23B may be either the originating number or the terminating number from the CDR/AIN 2302 as indicated by the identifier 2324 .      Referring back to FIG. 23A , a location/GPS engine 2308 extracts information from the fraud database including at least the telephone number 2322 . Generally, telephone numbers are in the format of “NPA-NXX-XXXX,” though other formats may be used in various countries and are contemplated within the scope of this invention. Once the telephone number 2322 is extracted from the fraud database 2306 , the location/GPS engine 2308 parses the telephone number 2322 into its NPA and NXX components. The “NPA” is the first three digits in the 10 -digit telephone number addressing scheme and is commonly known as the area code. The “NXX” is the second three digits in the 10 -digit telephone number addressing scheme and is also known as the prefix of the central office (CO) code. For instance, in the first telephone number 2322 of FIG. 23B , the NPA is “123” and the NXX is “456.”      An inventory of equipment, devices, and systems and their locations or coverage areas is kept by telecommunications providers or NPA NXX databases are commercially available such as the North American Local Exchange NPA NXX Database™ available from Quentin Sager Consulting (www.quenticsagerconsulting.com) of Altoona, Fla. or The Local Exchange Routing Guide, commonly known as “The LERG”, which is a database of NPA/NXX published every month by Telcordia Technologies, Inc. of Piscataway, N.J. In FIG. 23A , this is shown as an inventory database 2310 that, as with all databases discussed herein, may be comprised of more than one physical database or sources of information. The location/GPS engine 2308 , after extracting the NPA and NXX from the suspect telephone number 2322 , will search the inventory database 2310 first using the NPA. Once the NPA is found, then the location of a suspect telephone number 2322 is narrowed to the physical area within a particular NPA (area code). Once the NPA is found, the location/GPS engine 2308 searches all telephone numbers within that NPA for the corresponding NXX that was extracted from the suspect telephone number 2322 . Once the corresponding NXX is found, the search has now narrowed the suspect telephone number 2322 to the NPA (which can be correlated with a state or states), and from the NXX the CO that serves the suspect telephone number 2322 may be determined.      The inventory database 2310 also identifies equipment inventory by a code called a “CLLI” (common language location identification). CLLI provides carriers with a uniform system to identify their equipment, and locate other switching equipment, in a public switched telephone network. The 11 -character code identifies place, state, building, and switch function. Generally, digits five and six identify the state and digits 7 and 8 identify the CO. Digits 9-11 of the CLLI identify the switching equipment. The CLLI is also associated with a physical location. That location may be identified by a coordinate system (e.g., GPS, vertical and horizontal coordinates, etc.), or a physical address or by any other means of physically locating the equipment.       FIG. 23C shows sample records from an exemplary inventory database 2310 that may be used in an embodiment according to the present invention. Using the database of FIG. 23C , for example, a suspect telephone number 2322 may be matched with a physical address 2326 associated with a telephone addressing scheme having the NPA 2328 , NXX 2330 and last four digits 2332 of the suspect telephone number 2322 . It is to be appreciated that the inventory database 2310 contains an actual physical address or location and not a mailing or P.O. Box type address. Furthermore, it is to be appreciated that in some instances the FDS 2304 may not be able to provide a complete suspect telephone number 2322 , in which case the location of the fraud may only be narrowed to the CLLI location 2334 , 2336 , or the area encompassed by the NPA 2328 by the location/GPS engine 2308 .      Similar to the searching of the inventory database 2310 by the location/GPS engine 2308 for a physical address associated with a suspect telephone number 2322 , a billing database 2312 may also be searched and correlated with the information obtained from the inventory database 2310 . FIG. 23D illustrates sample records from an exemplary billing database 2312 that may be used in an embodiment according to the present invention. Such a database as that shown in FIG. 23D is comprised of the telephone number 2338 and the mailing address 2340 of the location where the bill for that telephone number 2338 is sent. Such databases are maintained by telecommunications providers and may be available as “phonebook” databases that may be downloaded from the Internet or purchased from telecommunications providers or publishers of telephone books. It is to be appreciated that telephone book information may not be as complete as information controlled by a telecommunications provider because of the ability to have non-published numbers. It is also to be appreciated that the billing address 2340 is not necessarily the same as the premise location 2326 as described in relation to FIG. 23C , above. For instance, the bill may be sent to a P.O. Box rather than a street address. Also, a corporation with many different physical sites may have their bills for services such as telephone sent to a centralized accounting department. The suspect telephone number 2322 from the fraud database is searched against the telephone numbers 2338 in the billing database 2312 in an attempt to find a billing address 2340 for that number 2322 . In one embodiment, once a matching address is found, an algorithm is executed by the location/GPS engine 2308 to obtain coordinates (e.g., GPS, vertical and horizontal coordinates, etc.) for the billing address, if possible, and as such algorithms are known in the art.      The location/GPS engine 2308 then uses the cumulative information derived from the fraud database 2306 , the inventory database 2310 , and the billing database 2312 to form a mapping database 2314 . Collectively, the inventory database 2310 and the billing database 2312 may be considered as a location database 2316 because their function in the exemplary system of FIG. 23A is to provide location information. An exemplary mapping database structure and exemplary records contained therein are shown in FIG. 23E , which may be used in an embodiment according to the present invention. The mapping database 2314 of FIG. 23E is comprised of complaint information 2342 , address information 2344 , an identifier 2346 that indicates whether the address is associated with the origination or termination of a suspected fraud activity, a database record identifier 348 , and an associated database record identifier 2350 . The associated database record identifier 2350 in coordination with the origination/termination identifier 2346 allows the graphical representation between the origination location of complaint/fraud activities and the termination of such activities. It is to be appreciated that the address information 2344 is the best physical address of the fraud location as determined by the location/GPS engine 2308 from the inventory database 2310 and the billing database 2312 . For instance, in order of priority, the physical address 2326 from inventory database 2310 is more accurate than a billing address 2340 from the billing database 2312 , which is more accurate than the CLLI (location) 2334 , 2336 , which is more accurate than the NXX range location, which is more accurate than the NPA range location, which is more accurate than simple guessing. Although the address information 2344 of FIG. 23E is generally shown as street-type addresses, it is to be appreciated that in various embodiments the address information 2344 may be in the form of coordinates such as GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude), horizontal and vertical coordinates, etc. It is also to be appreciated that the complaint information 2342 may be in the form of a code or standardized terms in various embodiments according to the present invention such that mapping icons, codes or color schemes may be used to illustrate the severity or character of the complaint or fraud. The mapping database 2314 provides information for mapping the complaint and fraud activities using a mapping computer program operating on a computing device. It is contemplated within the scope of this invention that information contained in the mapping database 2314 may be in various formats and varying order to accommodate the mapping computer program used in an embodiment according to the present invention.       FIG. 24 is an overview flowchart used to explain the steps of an exemplary process for geographic mapping of fraud activities based on information obtained from records related to telephone calls and location information correlation. The process begins at step 2400 . At step 2402 , call record information is reviewed to look for characteristics and patterns of fraudulent activities as such characteristics may be known. At step 2404 , call information of suspected fraud activities is associated with at least one geographical location. At step 2406 , the location information obtained at step 2404 is used to graphically designate a geographic point or area on an electronic map by a mapping computer program operating on the processor of a computing device and capable of displaying the geographic information associated with the suspected fraudulent activity. The process ends at step 2408 .       FIG. 25 is a flowchart used to explain the steps of an alternate exemplary process for geographic mapping of fraud activities based on CDR and location information correlation. The process begins at step 2500 . At step 2502 , a CDR is reviewed to look for characteristics and patterns of fraudulent activities as such characteristics may be known. In one embodiment, this review is performed by an algorithm executing on a computing device. At step 2504 , a suspected fraudulent activity is identified and at least the originating telephone number associated with the suspected fraudulent activity is extracted from the CDR. In other instances, other telephone numbers associated with the same suspected fraudulent activity may be obtained, such as the terminating number of repetitive nuisance calls or credit card fraud over the telephone. At Step 2506 , the one or more telephone numbers obtained in step 2504 are matched against inventory and billing records to find a physical (geographic) location associated with each telephone number. At step 2508 , the location information obtained at step 2506 for each telephone number is used to graphically designate a geographic point or area on an electronic map by a mapping computer program operating on the processor of a computing device and capable of displaying the geographic information associated with the suspected fraudulent activity. The process ends at step 2510 .      It is to be appreciated that while the embodiments according to the invention have thus far been generally described in relation to a public service telephone network (PSTN) or a plain old telephone system (POTS), they are equally applicable to telecommunications occurring over systems such as voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) and wireless systems using, for example, code division multiple access (CDMA) or global system for mobile communications (GSM). Detail records of phone calls are kept for these systems that are analogous to the CDR kept for PSTN systems and likewise can be analyzed and reviewed for suspected fraud activities. In the case of VoIP, IP address location may be found using, for example RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) information, and other means described herein. RADIUS is an authentication, authorization and accounting protocol for applications such as network access or IP mobility that is intended to work in both local and roaming situations. Likewise, call detail records are kept for calls between mobile devices and information in such records may be used to locate the billing address of the owner of the mobile device and, if useful, the location of the cells associated with communication involving the mobile device(s).       FIG. 26 shows a process for layered geographic mapping of threats comprised of intrusion information and fraud information consistent with the embodiments according to the present invention. The process begins at step 2600 . At step 2602 , intrusion information is received such as from a computer administrator, as the output of software designed to detect intrusions, from an intrusion detection system, router, network management system, security information manager, or from any other source. In one embodiment, the intrusion information may include an identification (such as the IP address) of the computer where the intrusion started or ended, the name and description of the intrusion, and possibly other data. At step 2604 and upon receipt of the intrusion information, it is stored in an intrusion database. FIG. 4 shows one embodiment of intrusion information within the intrusion database.      At step 2606 , fraud information is received such as from a network, as the output of software designed to detect fraud, from a fraud detection system, switching system, network management system, security information manager, or from any other source. In one embodiment, the fraud information may include a description of the suspected fraud and one or more telephone numbers suspected of either originating the fraud or the number where the fraud terminates. At step 2608 and upon receipt of the fraud information, it is stored in a fraud database. FIG. 23B shows one embodiment of fraud information within the fraud database.      Returning to FIG. 26 , at step 2614 location information is obtained for the information stored in the intrusion database and the fraud database. This process has previously been described for fraud information involving PSTNs in reference to FIGS. 22B and 23A . In regard to threat information, VoIP, and other Internet-facilitated communications, computing device 2202 retrieves, for computers (or network points) at which a threat or telephone call started or ended, CDR information for that computer (or network point) from an CDR database in instances in which the network address of the computer at which the threat started or ended comprises an IP address. In one embodiment, the threat or call information (such as the IP address) maybe used as a key to retrieve the appropriate record from CDR database. The CDR information may include wireless location data associated with the network point at which the threat or call started or ended, as necessary. FIG. 5 shows one exemplary embodiment of the CDR information within the CDR database.      In instances in which the CDR information identifies a cellular tower or other fixed network entity as servicing the call but does not provide more specific GPS data, at step 2616 computing device 2202 may also retrieve geographic location information for the cellular tower or other fixed network entity, from location database 2212 , 2232 . As above, this process has already been described in relation to an embodiment in which the threat data includes a network address, such as an IP address, of the computer at which the threat started or ended, however, the fraud information may provide a telephone number of a device involved in a call that is being investigated for fraud. In this instance, a customer database may be consulted to determine an address or other physical location associated with the telephone number. In either instance, the resulting location information may include such information as the physical location (e.g., mailing address or GPS coordinates) for the identified network point or computer.      Once the location information has been retrieved from databases for the intrusion and fraud events, it is stored in a map database at step 2618 . Within map database the retrieved information is preferably correlated such that all information for a particular intrusion, fraud \n"

No. 11/482,934, filed Jul. 10, 2006, entitled “GEOGRAPHICAL INTRUSION MAPPING SYSTEM USING TELECOMMUNICATION BILLING AND INVENTORY SYSTEMS,” which itself is a continuation-in-part of prior co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/916,873, filed Aug. 12, 2004, entitled “GEOGRAPHICAL INTRUSION RESPONSE PRIORITIZATION MAPPING SYSTEM,” and prior co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/916,872, filed Aug. 12, 2004, entitled “GEOGRAPHICAL VULNERABILITY MITIGATION RESPONSE MAPPING SYSTEM.” The contents of all the aforementioned applications are fully incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.   BACKGROUND     When a threat in a computer or telecommunications systems is discovered, response resources must be directed to a physical location of the equipment associated with the threat. In practice, this requires extensive efforts to correlate existing threat information, router traffic information and physical location of the router and impacted/suspect device, dramatically reducing response time. For example, today, most responses to an intrusion require manual review of information such as TCP/IP switch logs, call data records, advanced intelligent network logs, etc., with the subsequent manual drawing of network “maps” and, most importantly, trying to mitigate an intrusion in a sequential or business prioritization order while these efforts are being undertaken. These response schemes do not allow for an organization's management to easily identify the geographical location of the threat(s) and the location(s) at which resources are most needed. Furthermore, current response schemes do not allow an organization's response or management team timely access to geographical view(s) of the location of the threats together with information relating to the status or progress of the response to the threats.      In one instance, a digital or cyber threat may take the form of a direct attack, an introduction of malicious software such as virus and worm, or other intrusion generated by a computing device incorporating or being able to be located by one or more Global Positioning System (“GPS”) receivers. Accordingly, a PDA, a Smartphone, or a laptop with embedded and/or integrated GPS capabilities can be a source of a computer-originated attack, for example, a computer-triggered attack to remotely activate explosives. Likewise, certain wireless devices may be able to be located with some degree of specificity either through embedded GPS receivers or through GPS receivers incorporated into the towers/antennas that such devices access during an uplink. Both, a device having an incorporated GPS receivers and a device able to be located using stationary GPS receivers are referred to herein as a “GPS Device.”      A GPS device may be used to trigger a computer-originated attack in many ways. In one scenario, a GPS device may initiate a computer-originated attack directly, for example, by starting a digital or cyber attack. Alternatively, a GPS device, when vulnerable, may be at the receiving end of a first digital or cyber attack. Once the vulnerable GPS device is compromised, it may then fall under the influence of the first digital or cyber attack and initiate a computer-originated attack.      Fortunately, a GPS device may capture its location information via a protocol such as National Marine Electronics Association (“NMEA”) 0183 . The captured location information can then be transmitted via another protocol such as TCP or UDP to an incident response environment. For example, an existing security software vendor, such as Antivirus, may identify a digital or cyber attack, detect that the device is also receiving GPS information, and subsequently transmit the attack information and GPS information back to an incident response environment.      Response resources can be directed to a physical location of a GPS device under attack. In practice, however, this requires extensive efforts to correlate existing threat data or vulnerability data with GPS data collected and subsequently transmitted, thus reducing response time similar to a physical disaster or attack. So, even with the availability of GPS data, most current responses to an intrusion or vulnerability require manual review of TCP/IP switch information, manual drawing of network “maps” and, most importantly, trying to mitigate an intrusion or vulnerability in a sequential order, as described above.      In other instances, the hacking of networks such as those now ubiquitous in billing and financial systems, viruses launched against computer systems, intrusions onto computer hosts and networks, fraudulent activities resulting in the theft of services such as telephone service (wired or wireless), cable television, Internet access, etc. are just a few examples of more technologically-sophisticated crimes that are not easily mapped to a physical location.      Businesses and organizations have also used technology in an attempt to thwart these technologically-advanced crimes. One method is through the detection of anomalies in data associated with business transactions, such as the detection of unauthorized or malicious users on computer hosts and networks, often called intrusion detection and fraud detection systems.      For example, computer applications are created having several layers with each layer including detective, preventive, and corrective controls. At the business transaction layer, the detective controls apply business rules used for supervisory type reports that may be voluminous depending upon the nature of the business and the number of transactions occurring. Though there may exist a geographical correlation between physical, network and computer-related crimes, such correlation may not be apparent from review of numerous discrete reports from various sources and of varying types and formats while simultaneously trying to mitigate the crime and respond to them.      These response schemes do not allow for an organization's management to easily identify the geographical location of the problem(s) and the location(s) at which resources are most needed. Furthermore, current response schemes do not allow an organization's response or management team timely access to geographical view(s) of the location of the crimes together with information relating to the status or progress of the response to the threat.

As used herein, a “fraud” is an unauthorized use of an electronic network to use deception to obtain a service, good or other thing of value from another in reliance upon the deception.      As used herein, an “intrusion” is an unauthorized use, attempt, or successful entry into a digital, computerized, or automated system, requiring a response from a human administrator or response team to mitigate any damage or unwanted consequences of the entry. For example, the introduction of a virus and the unauthorized entry into a system by a hacker are each “intrusions” within the spirit of the present invention. An “intrusion response” is a response by systems or human operators to limit or mitigate damage from the intrusion or prevent future intrusions. Within the spirit and scope of the present invention, “intrusions” of many types and natures are contemplated.      In addition, as used herein, a “vulnerability” is a prospective intrusion, that is, a location in a digital, computerized, or automated system, at which an unauthorized use, attempt, or successful entry is possible or easier than at other points in the system. For example, a specific weakness may be identified in a particular operating system, such as Microsoft's Windows™ operating system when running less than Service Pack 6. Then, all computers running the Windows operating system with less than Service Pack 6 will therefore have this vulnerability. This and other vulnerabilities may be identified by commercially available software products. While methods of locating such vulnerabilities are outside the scope of the present invention, any of the vulnerabilities identified or located by such software products, now known or later developed, are within the spirit of the present invention.      In addition, as used herein, a “mitigation response” is the effort undertaken to reduce unwanted consequences or to eliminate the intrusion. For example, such a response may entail sending a human computer administrator to the site of the location to update software, install anti-virus software, eliminate a virus, or perform other necessary tasks. In addition, a response may entail installing a patch to the vulnerable computer, such as across a network. The present invention does not contemplate any specific responses. Instead, any response to an intrusion requiring the organization of resources is within the scope and spirit of the present invention.      For the ease of discussion, the following discussion will focus on the systems and methods of the present invention in terms of mapping “threats.” Reference to “threats” includes frauds, intrusions and vulnerabilities. Similarly, subsequent reference to “intrusions” includes both intrusions and vulnerabilities as described above.       FIG. 1 is a block diagram of one exemplary environment in which the systems and methods of the present invention may be implemented. As shown in FIG. 1 , system 100 employs mapping computer 102 . In addition, system 100 may also employ databases such as threat database 104 , telecommunications call (or call detail record (CDR)) database 106 , location database 108 , and map database 110 , each in electronic communication with mapping computer 102 . System 100 also includes a display 114 , such as a video display, for displaying the geographic information correlated and mapped by computer 102 using the methods discussed herein, and a network 112 , in electronic communication with computer 102 , in which the threats may occur.      In one embodiment, threat database 104 may contain information identifying a threat in the system, such as, for example, the threat type, description, and point of possible entry or exit (i.e., network point or computer). As shown in FIG. 1A , CDR database 106 for a plain old telephone service (POTS) may contain records identifying a plurality of telecommunications calls by date/time, duration, tariff cost, originating and terminating telephone numbers and switch identification. In instances in which the CDR database stores information related to telecommunications calls supported by a cellular or other wireless network, the CDR records may also include wireless location data, such as location data associated with the cellular tower servicing the telecommunications call or GPS data provided by a mobile terminal that originates or receives the telecommunications call. See, for example, FIG. 5 which illustrates other CDR records for telecommunications calls supported by a cellular or other wireless network. Location database 108 may contain geographical information such as the physical address or wireless location, e.g., GPS, coordinates of a potential point of entry or exit. Finally, map database 110 may correlate and contain information from the threat, CDR, and location databases as described below to map the threats.       FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary mapping computer 102 for use in system 100 , consistent with the present invention. Computer 102 includes a bus 202 or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a processor 204 coupled to bus 202 for processing information. Computer 102 also includes a main memory, such as a random access memory (RAM) 206 , coupled to bus 202 for storing information and instructions during execution by processor 204 . RAM 206 also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor 204 . Computer system 102 further includes a read only memory (ROM) 208 or other storage device coupled to bus 202 for storing static information and instructions for processor 204 . A mass storage device 210 , such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus 202 for storing information and instructions.      Computer 102 may be coupled via bus 202 to a display 212 , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a computer user. Display 212 may, in one embodiment, operate as display 114 .      Computer 102 may further be coupled to an input device 214 , such as a keyboard, coupled to bus 202 for communicating information and command selections to processor 204 . Another type of user input device is a cursor control 216 , such as a mouse, a trackball or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor 204 and for controlling cursor movement on display 212 . Cursor control 216 typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), which allow the device to specify positions in a plane.      According to one embodiment, computer 102 executes instructions for geographic mapping of threat information. Either alone or in combination with another computer system, computer 102 thus permits the geographic mapping of threats in response to processor 204 executing one or more sequences of instructions contained in RAM 206 . Such instructions may be read into RAM 206 from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device 210 . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in RAM 206 causes processor 204 to perform the functions of mapping computer 102 , and/or the process stages described herein. In an alternative implementation, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus, implementations consistent with the principles of the present invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.      The term “computer-readable medium” as used herein refers to any media that participates in providing instructions to processor 204 for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device 210 . Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as RAM 206 . Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus 202 . Transmission media may also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red data communications.      Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, RAM, PROM, EPROM, FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer may read. For the purposes of this discussion, carrier waves are the signals which carry the data to and from computer 102 .      Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor 204 for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on the magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer may load the instructions into a dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer 102 may receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector coupled to bus 202 may receive the data carried in the infra-red signal and place the data on bus 202 . Bus 202 carries the data to main memory 206 , from which processor 204 retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory 206 may optionally be stored on storage device 210 either before or after execution by processor 204 .      Computer 102 may also include a communication interface 218 coupled to bus 202 . Communication interface 218 provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link 220 that may be connected to network 112 . Network 112 may be a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or any other network configuration. For example, communication interface 218 may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. Computer 102 may communicate with a host 224 via network 112 . As another example, communication interface 218 may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface 218 sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.      Network link 220 typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. In this embodiment, network 112 may communicate with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) 226 . For example, network link 220 may provide a connection to data equipment operated by the ISP 226 . ISP 226 , in turn, provides data communication services from another server 230 or host 224 to computer 102 . Network 112 may use electric, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams.      Computer 102 may send messages and receive data, including program code, through network 112 , network link 220 and communication interface 218 . In this embodiment, server 230 may download an application program to computer 102 via network 112 and communication interface 218 . Consistent with the present invention, one such downloaded application geographically maps vulnerability or threat information, such as, for example, by executing methods 300 and/or 900 , to be described below in reference to FIGS. 3 and 9 . The received code may be executed by processor 204 as it is received and/or stored in storage device 210 , or other non-volatile storage for later execution.      Although computer system 102 is shown in FIG. 2 as connectable to server 230 , those skilled in the art will recognize that computer system 102 may establish connections to multiple servers on Internet 228 and/or network 112 . Such servers may include HTML-based Internet applications to provide information to computer system 102 upon request in a manner consistent with the present invention.      Returning to FIG. 1 , display 114 may, in one embodiment, be implemented as display 212 ( FIG. 2 ), directly connected to computer 102 . In an alternative embodiment, display 114 may be connected to computer 102 via network 112 . For example, display 114 may be a display connected to another computer on network 112 , or may be a stand-alone display device such as a video projector connected to computer 102 via network 112 .      In addition, databases 104 , 106 , 108 , and 110 may each reside within computer 102 or may reside in any other location, such as on network 112 , so long as they are in electronic communication with computer 102 .      In one embodiment, location database 108 is a static database in which the physical location of routers or network points is located. Such location information may include router (IP/MAC) address, and router (or network point) physical address (geographic location), such as GPS coordinates. The CDR database 106 and location database 108 may be kept in accordance with any now known or later developed methods for implementing and maintaining call detail records, or physical location information, respectively.      In an alternative embodiment, databases 104 , 106 , 108 , and 110 , may be implemented as a single database, or may be implemented as any number of databases. For example, system 100 may include multiple threat, CDR, location, and map databases. Furthermore, in one embodiment, databases 104 , 106 , 108 , and 110 may be implemented as a single database containing all of the described information. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that system 100 may include any number (one or more) of databases so long as the information discussed herein may be retrieved and correlated as discussed herein.      Finally, databases 104 , 106 , 108 , and 110 may be implemented using any now known or later developed database schemes or database software. For example, in one embodiment, each of the databases may be implemented using a relational database scheme, and/or may be built using Microsoft Access™ or Microsoft Excel™ software. While, more likely, one or more databases will be implemented to take into account other factors outside the scope of the present invention, any implementation (and location) of the present databases is contemplated within the scope and spirit of the present invention.       FIG. 3 shows a method 300 for execution, such as by computer 102 , for geographic mapping of threat information, consistent with one embodiment of the present invention. Method 300 begins by receiving threat information, stage 302 , such as from a computer administrator, as the output of software designed to detect threats, from a threat detection system, router, network management system, security information manager, or from any other source. In one embodiment, the threat information may include an identification (such as the IP address) of the computer where the threat started or ended, the name and description of the threat, and possibly other data. Upon receipt of the threat information, it is stored in threat database 104 at stage 304 . FIG. 4 shows one embodiment of threat information 400 within threat database 104 .      Returning to FIG. 3 , in instances in which the computer where the threat started or ended is a computer that is configured to communicate via cellular or other wireless networks, computer 102 then retrieves, for computers or network points (hereinafter generally referenced as “computers”) at which a threat started or ended, CDR information for that computer from CDR database 106 , at stage 306 . In one embodiment, the threat information (such as the IP address) may be used as a key to retrieve the appropriate record from CDR database 106 . The CDR information may include the IP address of a computer that participates in a telecommunications call, such as an exchange of messages, a transfer of data or the like, wireless location data identifying the location of the computer during a respective telecommunications call, and other information relating to the telecommunications call and/or the computer at which the threat started or ended, as necessary. As noted, the wireless location data may be location data associated with the cellular tower servicing the telecommunications call or GPS data provided by the mobile device. FIG. 5 shows one exemplary embodiment of the CDR information within CDR database 106 .      In instances in which the wireless location data identifies a cellular tower servicing the telecommunications call, computer 102 may also retrieve geographic location information for the cellular tower from location database 108 , at stage 308 . In one embodiment, the threat data (such as IP address) and/or the CDR data (such as the identification of the cellular tower) may be used as a key to identify a record corresponding to the location database record(s), corresponding to the cellular tower. The location information retrieved may include such information as the physical location (e.g., mailing address or GPS coordinates) for the identified cellular tower. FIG. 6 shows one exemplary embodiment 600 of the location information within location database 108 .      As described above and in greater detail below, the system and method of one embodiment receive threat information that includes a network address, such as an IP address, associated with a device affiliated with the threat, such as a device at which the threat began or ended, and then identify wireless location data, e.g., GPS data or data identifying a cellular tower and its location, associated with the device based upon its network address. In another embodiment, the system and method receive threat information, e.g., indicative of fraud or potential fraud, that includes the telephone number of a device affiliated with the threat, such as the calling telephone number or the called telephone number, and then identify the location of the device based upon an address associated with the telephone number in a customer database, such as a billing or inventory database.      Once this information has been retrieved from databases 104 , 106 , and 108 , it is stored in map database 110 at stage 310 . Within map database 110 , the retrieved information is preferably correlated such that all information for a particular threat is stored in a record for that threat. For example, FIG. 7 shows an exemplary screenshot 700 of records of map information for mapping threats, such as may be stored in map database 110 . As shown, map database records may contain the threat information including the network address (such as the IP address or telephone number), and the physical location, such as the mailing address (from location database 108 or a customer database) or GPS information (from CDR database 106 ). In addition, map database records may also include a status of the threat and an indication of the response person or team assigned to respond to the threat.      Upon correlating this information within map database 110 , computer 102 then maps the location of the threat at stage 312 . In one embodiment, the location information for each record is imported into a commercially available mapping program such as MapPoint™ by Microsoft, to visually locate the threat points with network 112 on a map. In one embodiment, the map may represent each of the threats as a symbol on the map, for example, as a push pin. An exemplary map 800 using this push pin approach is shown as FIG. 8 . Within map 800 , each pushpin 802 , 804 , shows the location of a point of threat requiring a response.      Using map 800 , response teams or system administrators will be able to identify “pockets” of threats and will be able to better prioritize and more efficiently schedule response personnel to respond and mitigate or eliminate the threat, based on geographic location. In addition, by continually updating the map and watching it change over time, system operators will be able to geographically view the spread, if any, of a threat. Furthermore, by also tracking system updates, the administrator will be able to identify new entry points.       FIG. 9 shows a flowchart of a method 900 for updating the geographic map with progress information. Method 900 begins with a response team or system administrator sending an update to the system to advise of a new status of a threat at stage 902 . For example, the response team may advise the system that the intruded computer must be replaced, and be rendered inactive until it is replaced, (i.e., the threat is “open”) or may advise the system that the intruded computer has been upgraded and is no longer compromised.      Once this information is received, the map database record for the identified threat is updated at stage 904 . For example, each threat record in the database may contain a field to identify the status of the threat (see FIG. 7 ). Possible status indicators may reflect that the threat is “new,” “open” (i.e., not yet responded to), “assigned to a response team,” “closed” (i.e., responded to and fixed), or any other status that may be of use to the organization for which the system has been implemented.      Once the map database record has been updated, map computer 102 can update map 800 to reflect the updated status of the threat. For example, one way that map 800 can show the status information is to display color-coded push pin symbols to reflect the status. In one embodiment, a red push pin may signify an “open” or “new” threat, a yellow push pin may signify a threat that has been assigned, but not yet fixed, and a green push pin may signify a closed threat. By mapping this information together with the locations of the threats, administrators can better track the progress of their response teams, and more fluidly schedule responses to new threats as they arise.      Any symbol or representation may be used to identify a threat on the map, including, but not limited to, a push-pin symbol. These symbols and representations may be used to identify the quantity of threats in that area of the map, such as by varying the color of the symbol to identify such quantity. In addition, the symbol or representation may be linked to the underlying data such that a user, using an input device, may select a symbol on the map causing computer 102 to display the status, quantity, address, or other information corresponding to the selected symbol.      The preferred threat mapping systems and methods may applied in various environments using various equipment and data analogous to the described above. Described below are various specific implementations thereof in the context of certain network environments.       FIG. 10 is a block diagram of a second exemplary environment 1000 in which preferred systems and methods consistent with the present invention may be implemented. The number of components in environment 1000 is not limited to what is shown and other variations in the number of arrangements of components are possible. The components of FIG. 10 may be implemented through hardware, software, and/or firmware.      As shown in FIG. 10 , environment 1000 may include a threat detection system (“TDS”) 1020 , an identification system 1030 , a location system 1040 , and a mapping system 1050 , each directly or indirectly in electronic communication with the other systems. Similarly to the environment 100 of FIG. 1 , such communication may be conducted through a network 112 as described above. Also similarly to the environment 100 of FIG. 1 , environment 1000 also includes a display device 114 , such as a video display, for displaying the geographical threat information correlated and mapped by the mapping system 1050 using the methods discussed herein.      The TDS 1020 includes various systems including, for example, firewall logs, that can provide information related to network threats, vulnerabilities or other security threats. For example, the TDS may identify attacks and contain information such as the attack type, description, and impacted device information such as a network device, e.g., an IP address, of the impacted device (e.g., a router, a connected computer). TDS 1020 may also include threat database 1022 , which stores threat information, such as the aforementioned attack-related information (e.g., threat type, threat description, and impacted device information such as a network address or telephone number of the impacted device). FIG. 4 illustrates one example of threat information 400 that may be stored in threat database 1022 . FIG. 15 illustrates a second example of threat information 1500 that may be stored in threat database 1022 . Other examples are of course possible.      Exemplary identification system 1030 may include various systems that can provide information useful for identifying network points (e.g., network equipment, connected computers, users, etc.) within environment 1000 . For example, in environment 1000 , identification system 1030 includes an authentication system 1031 . Authentication system 1031 may be implemented, for example, through the RADIUS Authentication Protocol, to verify that a user is indeed authorized to operate in environment 1000 . RADIUS is used commonly with embedded network devices such as routers, modem servers, and switches. A typical RADIUS packet includes fields such as code, identifier, length, authenticator, and attributes. In one example, a RADIUS packet may contain attributes such as username and password, which may be used to identify a particular user in the network. When a RADIUS packet is sent from a network point in a telecom system, it may also contain telephony attributes such as a calling party telephone number (e.g., “Caller ID” information).      A user or client may initiate an authentication process by sending a RADIUS Access-Request packet to a server in authentication system 1031 . The server will then process the packet and send back a response packet to the client if the server possesses a shared secret for the client. Once the authentication is confirmed by the client, authentication system 1031 may store pertinent authentication data in authentication database 1032 . Authentication data may contain, for example, an IP address, user information, caller ID information and authentication identification (e.g., crypto-keys). Authentication database 1032 thus may serve as a source for identification information for network points in environment 1000 . FIG. 16 illustrates one example of records storing authentication data 1600 in authentication database 1032 . Other examples are of course possible.      In some implementations (e.g., telecom networks), identification system 1030 may also include a call database 1033 , which may store data related to call transactions, such as calling party telephone number, called party telephone number, other network addresses associated with a caller or network equipment used in a call (e.g., MINs, IP/MAC addresses), etc. For example, in a Voice over IP system, an IP address may be associated with a conventional telephone number, in order to perform proper call routing. Call database 1033 thus may serve as a source for identification information for network points in environment 1000 . FIG. 5 illustrates one example of records storing call data in a call database 1033 . Other examples are of course possible.      Exemplary location system 1040 includes various systems that are useful in identifying physical (geographic) locations associated with network points in environment 1000 . For example, location system 1040 may include a customer database 1042 , which may contain geographical information such as the physical address or geographic coordinates (e.g., mailing address, latitude and longitude) for the customers (or other parties) that use network 112 . Information in customer database 1042 may be identified by various data that is associated with a particular customer entity, such as authentication data (illustrated in FIG. 11A as location data 1100 ), caller ID information (illustrated in FIG. 11B as location data 1101 ), a combination thereof and/or other customer-specific identifiers. Location system 1040 may also include a network element database 1043 , which may comprise the aforementioned location database 108 (see FIG. 1 , FIG. 6 ) and/or other databases that track physical locations of network switching elements.      Exemplary mapping system 1050 may be configured to correlate data from the various databases described above, and to map threats accordingly (as further described below). Mapping system 1050 may be implemented using computer 102 , map database 110 and display 114 as described above (see FIG. 2 ). Computer 102 may be configured to execute instructions that perform the various operations associated with the exemplary threat mapping processes described herein.      As was the case for environment 100 , network security system 1020 , identification system 1030 , location system 1040 and mapping system 1050 of environment 1000 may be interconnected directly or indirectly, with or without network 112 . Moreover, elements of each of these systems may be distributed across multiple computing platforms, or concentrated into only one or a few computing platforms. For example, network security system 1020 , identification system 1030 , and location system 1040 may each reside within mapping system 1050 , or may reside in any other location in any combination, so long as they are in electronic communication with mapping system 1050 . Likewise the various databases may be implemented as a single database, or may be implemented as any number of databases. For example, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that environment 1000 may include multiple authentication databases, such as having one for each geographical region served by environment 1000 . Similarly, environment 1000 may include multiple threat, authentication, call, customer location and/or mapping databases, or a single database containing all of the described information. Any implementation (and configuration) of the system environment described herein is contemplated.       FIG. 13 shows a preferred method 1300 which may be performed in conjunction with mapping system 1050 to geographically correlate and map threats in environment 1000 . Method 1300 is similar in many respects to method 300 (see FIG. 3 ), and is presented here as specifically applicable to the exemplary environment 1000 . Method 1300 begins (similarly to method 300 of FIG. 3 ) by receiving threat data at stage 1302 and recording the threat data in threat database 1022 in stage 1304 . As noted above, threat data may be any information describing or identifying a threat. Threat data can be received from a computer administrator, from the output of software designed to detect or discover threats from TDS or firewall logs, from a network management system, from a security information manager, or from any other source. FIGS. 4 and 15 illustrate examples of threat data recorded in threat database 1022 .      Returning to FIG. 13 , in stage 1305 the mapping system receives the threat data from threat database 1022 . In stage 1306 , mapping system 1050 retrieves identification information from a CDR database, such as at least one of authentication database data 1032 and call database 1033 , for those network points at which the threats started (or ended). In one embodiment, at least one part of the threat data (such as the IP address or Caller ID information) may be used as a key to retrieve the associated record(s) in authentication database 1032 and/or call database 1033 . As shown by the examples in FIGS. 5 and 16 , the retrieved identification data can include authentication identification, network address, e.g., IP address, caller ID information, and/or any other network address information of the network point at which the threat started or ended, as necessary.      At stage 1308 , mapping system 1050 retrieves geographical location data, for the computer or device at which the threat(s) started or ended, from location system 1040 . In one embodiment, at least one part of the identification data (such as authentication identification or caller ID information) may be used as a key to identify and retrieve the associated record(s) in at least one of customer database 1042 and /or network element database 1043 . The location data retrieved may include such information as the physical location (e.g., mailing address or geographic coordinates) for the identified attacked network point or device. FIGS. 6, 11A and 11 B show examples of such location data.      At stage 1310 , the retrieved data are preferably correlated such that all information for a particular threat is stored in a record or records for that threat. In one embodiment, the correlated data are stored as map data in mapping database 110 . FIG. 7 shows an example of records in mapping database 110 . As shown, mapping database records may contain the threat information, the network address (such as the IP address or telephone number), and the physical location such as the mailing address or coordinate information. In addition, mapping database records may also include a status of the threat and an indication of the response person or team assigned to respond to the threat.      Returning to FIG. 13 , at stage 1312 , mapping system 1050 maps the location of the threat. In one embodiment, the map data for each threat are imported into a commercially available mapping program such as Microsoft MapPoint™ to visually locate the threat points on a map presented on display 114 . In one embodiment, the map may represent each of the threats as a symbol on the map, for example, as a “pushpin.” An exemplary map 800 using this pushpin approach is shown in FIG. 8 . Within map 800 , each pushpin symbol 802 , 804 , shows the location of a point of threat requiring a response. The color of the pushpin symbol or representation on the map may be used to identify the quantity of threats in an area on the map, allowing the administrators to easily identify problem areas. In addition, the symbol (i.e., pushpin or other symbol) may be linked to the underlying data. For example, FIG. 12 illustrates a map 1200 , which includes description windows associated with each pushpin location 1202 , 1204 (e.g., specifying the address associated with each pushpin). In some embodiments, a system user may, using an input device, select a symbol on the map to initiate a display of data such as the threat type, network address, status of the response, or other information.       FIGS. 14A and 14B are block diagrams showing two exemplary methods for geographically mapping threats through correlation. In FIG. 14A , mapping system 1050 receives, from threat database 1022 in TDS 1020 , threat data containing, for example, one or more of a source network address such as a source IP address or a source telephone number, destination network address such as a destination IP address or a destination telephone number, and attack event name, at stage 1412 . In addition, at stage 1414 , mapping system 1050 receives identification data from a CDR database, such as the authentication database 1032 of identification system 1030 . The identification data may contain, for example, an IP address and authentication identification. At stage 1416 , mapping system 1050 receives location data from a customer database 1042 in location system 1040 . Location data may contain, for example, a telephone number and billing information such as mailing addresses. These stages, namely, 1412 , 1414 and 1416 , may take place in other sequences than described here.      After receiving threat, identification, and location data, mapping system 1050 correlates threat data and identification data with location data to generate map data. In one embodiment, mapping system 1050 joins tables from the aforementioned databases, utilizes network address as a key to identify the record(s) indicating the source or destination of the threat and the identity of the network point experiencing the threat, uses the identification data to locate associated geographic coordinates, and generates map data containing network address, attack event name, and geographic coordinates for storage in mapping database 110 . This correlation may be implemented in many other ways. At stage 1418 , mapping system 1050 generates a map displaying a geographical location of the threat(s) based on the map data from mapping database 110 .      In another embodiment, FIG. 14B shows an exemplary method where the mapping system does not communicate directly with the identification system. In FIG. 14B , identification system 1030 receives, from TDS 1020 , threat data describing or identifying the threat(s), at stage 1420 . Also at stage 1420 , identification system 1030 queries the table(s) in the authentication database 1032 , utilizing either source network address or destination network address of the threat(s) in threat database 1022 as a key to identify the record(s) containing identification information associated with the network address. At stage 1422 , location system 1040 receives identification data from identification system 1030 , and uses this data to identify the record(s) containing location data associated with the identification data from the customer database 1042 .      Mapping system 1050 receives location data from location system 1040 at stage 1424 and threat data identifying the source or destination of the threat(s) from threat database 1022 at stage 1426 . Mapping system 1050 correlates the threat data with location data and generates map data containing network address, attack event name, and geographic coordinates for storage in mapping database 110 . In one embodiment, after stage 1422 , location data contain an identifier such as network address and the correlation is implemented by matching the identifiers between location data and threat data. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that this correlation may be implemented in many ways. At stage 1428 , mapping system 1050 generates a map displaying a geographical location of the threat(s) based on the map data from mapping database 110 .      The map data in mapping database 110 may be periodically updated, as described above with respect to FIG. 9 .       FIG. 17 is a block diagram of a third exemplary environment 1700 in which preferred systems and methods consistent with the present invention may be implemented. The number of components in environment 1700 is not limited to what is shown and other variations in the number of arrangements of components are possible. The components of FIG. 17 may be implemented through hardware, software, and/or firmware.      As shown in FIG. 17 , environment 1700 may include a TDS 1020 and a mapping system 1750 similar those depicted in FIG. 10 and described above, with modifications as noted below. Also similarly to the environment 100 of FIG. 1 , environment 1700 also includes a display device 114 , such as a video display, for displaying the geographical threat information correlated and mapped by the mapping system 1750 using the methods discussed herein. Identification system 1030 and location system 1040 of FIG. 10 , although not shown in FIG. 17 , may be included in system environment 1700 in a manner similar to described above. Communication between systems in environment 1700 may be conducted through a network 112 as described above.      In addition, environment 1700 may include a mobile device 1740 , such as a GPS device, from which the network security system 1020 and/or mapping system 1750 receives wireless location data, such as GPS data in a format such as NMEA 0183 via software transmitting this data using protocols such as TCP or UDP. Mobile device 1740 may communicate with network security system 1020 and/or mapping system 1750 via one or more well known data transmission capabilities or software. While the mobile device may be embodied as a GPS-enabled device as noted above, other types of mobile devices may be employed that identify its location based upon signals transmitted by the mobile device through a wireless network. For example, the location of other types of mobile devices may be provided in relation to one or more cell towers or base stations.       FIG. 18 shows a preferred method 1800 which may be performed by mapping system 1750 to locate sources of computer-originated attacks on mobile devices. Method 1800 begins by recording threat data at stage 1802 . Similar to step 302 of method 300 , threat data may be any information describing or identifying a threat. In one embodiment, the threat data may include an identification (such as the IP address or telephone number) of the mobile device or network point where the computer-originated attack started, and the name and description of the attack event, among other information. The threat data are stored in threat database 1022 . As noted above, FIG. 5 shows one embodiment of threat data within threat database 1022 .      Returning to FIG. 18 , at stage 1804 , the threat data stored in TDS 1020 is retrieved. At stage 1806 , mapping system 1750 retrieves wireless location data for mobile devices 1740 at which the computer-originated attack(s) started. In one embodiment in which the mobile device is GPS enabled, at least one part of the threat data (such as the IP address or telephone number) may be used as a key to retrieve the appropriate wireless location record(s), such as from a CDR database in instances in which the threat data includes an IP address or a customer database in instances in which the threat data includes a telephone number. In one embodiment, the wireless location data may include IP address and location information, such as geographic coordinates, of the mobile device 1740 at which the computer-originated attack(s) started, as necessary. FIG. 20 shows one exemplary embodiment of wireless location data 2000 , which may be provided by GPS-enabled device 1740 .      Once the relevant data have been retrieved from threat database 1022 and mobile device 1740 , they may be stored in mapping system 1750 (e.g., in mapping database 1752 ). At stage 1808 , the retrieved threat data and wireless location data are preferably correlated such that all information for a particular computer-originated attack is stored in a record or records for that attack. In one embodiment, the correlated data are stored as map data in mapping database 1752 . FIG. 21 shows an exemplary embodiment of records 2100 in mapping database 1752 . As shown, mapping database records 2100 may contain attack event name, the network address (such as the IP address or telephone number from threat database 1022 ), and the physical location such as geographic coordinates (from the wireless location data provided by the mobile device 1740 ) or the billing address (from a customer database). In addition, mapping database records may also include a status of the threat and an indication of the response person or team assigned to respond to the threat.      Returning to FIG. 18 , at stage 1810 , mapping system 1750 maps the location of the source of the computer-originated attack. In one embodiment, the map data for each computer-originated attack are imported into a commercially available mapping program such as Microsoft MapPoint™ to visually locate the threat points on a map presented on display 114 . As noted above, the map may represent each of the threats as a symbol on the map, for example, as a “pushpin,” such as illustrated in FIG. 8 , where each pushpin symbol 802 , 804 , shows the location of a point of threat. As in the previously described embodiments, the mapping provided herein may allow response teams to identify “pockets” of threats and will be able to better prioritize and more efficiently schedule response personnel to respond and mitigate or eliminate the threats, based on geographical location. The map may be updated when threat information becomes updates, as noted above. In addition, due the mobile nature of GPS devices, the map may be updated at regular intervals using currently available GPS data from GPS devices 1740 .       FIGS. 19A and 19B are block diagrams showing two exemplary methods for locating a source of a computer-originated attack based on a GPS device. In the method depicted in FIG. 19A , in a stage 1912 , mapping system 1750 receives, from threat database 1022 in TDS 1020 , threat data containing, for example, source network address such as source IP address or source telephone number, destination network address such as destination IP address or destination telephone number, and attack event name. In addition, at stage 1914 , mapping system 1750 receives wireless location data from mobile device 1740 . Wireless location data contains, for example, IP address and geographic coordinates of the impacted mobile device or a cell tower or base station serving the mobile device. These stages 1912 and 1914 may take place simultaneously or in any sequence.      After receiving threat and wireless location data, mapping system 1750 correlates threat data with wireless location data to generate map data, as noted above. In one embodiment, mapping system 1750 joins tables from threat database 1022 with wireless location data, utilizes the network address in the wireless location data as a key to identify the record(s) indicating the source of the threat or computer-originated attack from threat database 1022 , and generates map data containing network address, attack event name, and geographic coordinates in mapping database 1752 . At stage 1916 , mapping system 1750 generates a map displaying a geographical location of the source of the threat(s) based on the map data from mapping database 1752 .      In the exemplary method depicted in FIG. 19B , the TDS communicates directly with the mobile device. As shown, TDS 1020 receives wireless location data describing or identifying the impacted mobile device from the mobile device 1740 at stage 1920 . Also at stage 1920 , TDS 1020 queries the table(s) in threat database 1022 , utilizing the network address associated with the wireless data as a key to identify the record(s) describing or identifying the threat(s) from threat database 1022 .      At stage 1922 , mapping system 1750 receives threat data describing or identifying the threat(s) from threat database 1022 . At stage 1924 , mapping system 1750 receives wireless location data from mobile device 1740 . Mapping system 1750 further correlates threat data with wireless location data and generates map data containing network address, attack event name, and geographic coordinates in mapping database 1752 . In one embodiment, the correlation is implemented by matching the network addresses between wireless location data and threat data, although other correlation methods are possible. At stage 1926 , mapping system 1750 generates a map displaying geographical location of the source of the threat(s) or vulnerabilit(ies) based on the map data from mapping database 1752 .      The source of a wireless (data) call may also be located based upon wireless location data. In this regard, mapping system 1750 receives, from threat database 1022 in TDS 1020 , threat data containing, for example, source network address, destination network address, and attack event name. Information about the source network address of a threat is passed from the threat database 1022 to an authentication module (e.g., RADIUS). The source network address is correlated with authentication information at the authentication module. The authentication information is then passed from the authentication module to a location information module, where the location, e.g., the GPS coordinates, of the source of the wireless call are determined, as such determinations may be made by various systems in wireless communications systems, such as by reference to a CDR database. Mapping system 1750 receives wireless location (e.g., GPS) data from location information module 1932 . Wireless location data contains, for example, IP address and geographic (GPS) coordinates of the impacted source device.      After receiving threat and wireless location data, mapping system 1750 correlates threat data with wireless location data to generate map data, as noted above. In one embodiment, mapping system 1750 joins tables from threat database 1022 with wireless location data, utilizes the network address in the wireless location data as a key to identify the record(s) indicating the source of the threat or computer-originated attack from threat database 1022 , and generates map data containing network address, attack event name, and geographic coordinates in mapping database 1752 . At stage 1926 , mapping system 1750 generates a map displaying a geographical location of the source of the threat(s) based on the map data from mapping database 1752 .       FIG. 22A is an alternative block diagram of one exemplary environment in which the systems and methods of the present invention may be implemented. As shown in FIG. 22A , system 2200 employs a computing device 2202 that may be used for mapping. Such a computing device may be one such as is shown and described in relation to FIG. 2 , above, though other computing devices capable of performing a mapping function are contemplated within the scope of this invention. In addition, the embodiment of system 2200 may also employ databases such as a threat database 2204 , a fraud database 2208 , a location database 2212 , and a mapping database 2214 , each in electronic communication with computing device 2202 . System 2200 also includes a display 2216 , such as a video display, for displaying the geographic information correlated and mapped by computing device 2202 using the methods discussed herein, and a network 2218 , in electronic communication with the computing device 2202 . The components that comprise the system 2200 communicate with one another through a network 2218 , which may be wired, wireless, optical or combinations thereof. The network 2218 is comprised of physical and virtual devices and connections and includes computer software executing on the processors of one or more computing devices, memory, firmware and the network may support one or more communications protocols such as, for example, TCP/IP.      Yet another alternative block diagram of one exemplary environment in which the systems and methods of the present invention may be implemented is shown in FIG. 22B . In FIG. 22B , one or more threat detection systems (TDSs) 2220 , such as the one described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/916,873, filed Aug. 12, 2004, entitled “GEOGRAPHICAL INTRUSION RESPONSE PRIORITIZATION MAPPING SYSTEM,” fully incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof, are used to populate a threat database 2222 . Likewise, one or more fraud detection systems (FDSs) 2224 , such as the one described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/319,608, “MULTIDIMENSIONAL TRANSACTION FRAUD DETECTION SYSTEM AND METHOD,” having as an inventor James T. McConnell and filed on Dec. 29, 2005, fully incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof,, are used to populate a fraud database 2226 . Information from each of these databases 2222 , 2226 is provided to a location/GPS engine 2230 operating on one or more processors on one or more computing devices. Information provided to the location/GPS engine 2230 may include, for example, data related to the nature of the threat and information from which a location may be determined such as, for example, an IP address, a telephone number, a street address, etc. The location/GPS engine 2230 receives the provided database information and, if a more accurate location is needed or if the provided address is to be verified or correlated with other location information, the location/GPS engine 2230 accesses a location database 2232 . The location database 2232 may be comprised of a number of separate databases or it may be an amalgamation of information from various sources and databases into one database. In one exemplary embodiment, the location database 2232 may be comprised of an inventory database 2234 that includes information about telecommunications and network equipment and the location of such equipment; a billing database 2236 that includes information about billing addresses for telecommunications, ISP, CATV or other system, network or services subscribers; a RADIUS database 2238 , which is further described herein; and a GPS database 2252 , which provides GPS location information (e.g., coordinates) of devices containing GPS receivers that access a network or the location of devices that access one or more GPS-enabled devices. It is to be appreciated that this is just one embodiment of a location database and it is contemplated under the scope of this invention that location databases comprised of different, more, fewer and different combinations of databases or sources of location information are contemplated.      From the location database 2232 , the location/GPS engine 2230 determines a physical location or coordinates (e.g., GPS-latitude and longitude, horizontal and vertical, etc.) for the threat information received from one or both of the threat database 2222 and the fraud database 2226 or any other threat database. The data related to the nature of the threat and its associated location or coordinate information is then provided to a mapping database 2246 , where it is stored and may be accessed by a mapping computer product operating computing device 2248 and graphically displayed on a display 2250 .      As previously described, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/319,608 describes one method of determining fraud in transactions. Another method of detecting fraud in telecommunications transactions and activities is through the monitoring of call detail records (CDRs) or advanced intelligent network (AIN) information. FIG. 23A is block diagram of one exemplary environment in which the systems and methods of fraud detection in a telecommunications system may be implemented. As shown in FIG. 23A , the CDR/AIN 2302 is comprised of computer records containing data unique to a specific call. The information is processed as a unit and may contain details such as, for example, an originating switch, an originating telephone number, a terminating switch, a terminating telephone number, call length, time of day, etc. CDRs and AIN records are known in the art and one or both are used by most telecommunications providers. Telecommunications providers employ FDSs 2304 to monitor and analyze the CDR/AIN 2302 for activities and patterns of activities or characteristics that are indicative of fraudulent activities based on known fraudulent behavior and the business rules of the organization. Generally, FDSs 2304 are computer algorithms implemented on computing device as large amounts of data is reviewed. FDSs 2304 are generally known in the art by those of ordinary skill. In other instances the review of the CDR/AIN 2302 may be performed manually.      Based on the application of the FDS 2304 to the CDR/AIN 2302 , or manual review of the CDR/AIN 2302 , a fraud detection log is created and stored in a fraud database 2306 . The fraud database 2306 includes at least some information about the suspected fraudulent activity or complaint (or a code that corresponds to a description of the suspected fraudulent activity in a table), and one or more telephone numbers suspected of involvement in the potentially fraudulent activity. An exemplary database record for a fraud database 2306 is shown in FIG. 23B showing a complaint description 2320 and a telephone number 2322 associated with that complaint. It also includes an identifier 2324 that indicates whether the telephone number 2322 is an originating telephone number or a terminating telephone number. It is to be appreciated that the telephone number 2322 shown in FIG. 23B may be either the originating number or the terminating number from the CDR/AIN 2302 as indicated by the identifier 2324 .      Referring back to FIG. 23A , a location/GPS engine 2308 extracts information from the fraud database including at least the telephone number 2322 . Generally, telephone numbers are in the format of “NPA-NXX-XXXX,” though other formats may be used in various countries and are contemplated within the scope of this invention. Once the telephone number 2322 is extracted from the fraud database 2306 , the location/GPS engine 2308 parses the telephone number 2322 into its NPA and NXX components. The “NPA” is the first three digits in the 10 -digit telephone number addressing scheme and is commonly known as the area code. The “NXX” is the second three digits in the 10 -digit telephone number addressing scheme and is also known as the prefix of the central office (CO) code. For instance, in the first telephone number 2322 of FIG. 23B , the NPA is “123” and the NXX is “456.”      An inventory of equipment, devices, and systems and their locations or coverage areas is kept by telecommunications providers or NPA NXX databases are commercially available such as the North American Local Exchange NPA NXX Database™ available from Quentin Sager Consulting (www.quenticsagerconsulting.com) of Altoona, Fla. or The Local Exchange Routing Guide, commonly known as “The LERG”, which is a database of NPA/NXX published every month by Telcordia Technologies, Inc. of Piscataway, N.J. In FIG. 23A , this is shown as an inventory database 2310 that, as with all databases discussed herein, may be comprised of more than one physical database or sources of information. The location/GPS engine 2308 , after extracting the NPA and NXX from the suspect telephone number 2322 , will search the inventory database 2310 first using the NPA. Once the NPA is found, then the location of a suspect telephone number 2322 is narrowed to the physical area within a particular NPA (area code). Once the NPA is found, the location/GPS engine 2308 searches all telephone numbers within that NPA for the corresponding NXX that was extracted from the suspect telephone number 2322 . Once the corresponding NXX is found, the search has now narrowed the suspect telephone number 2322 to the NPA (which can be correlated with a state or states), and from the NXX the CO that serves the suspect telephone number 2322 may be determined.      The inventory database 2310 also identifies equipment inventory by a code called a “CLLI” (common language location identification). CLLI provides carriers with a uniform system to identify their equipment, and locate other switching equipment, in a public switched telephone network. The 11 -character code identifies place, state, building, and switch function. Generally, digits five and six identify the state and digits 7 and 8 identify the CO. Digits 9-11 of the CLLI identify the switching equipment. The CLLI is also associated with a physical location. That location may be identified by a coordinate system (e.g., GPS, vertical and horizontal coordinates, etc.), or a physical address or by any other means of physically locating the equipment.       FIG. 23C shows sample records from an exemplary inventory database 2310 that may be used in an embodiment according to the present invention. Using the database of FIG. 23C , for example, a suspect telephone number 2322 may be matched with a physical address 2326 associated with a telephone addressing scheme having the NPA 2328 , NXX 2330 and last four digits 2332 of the suspect telephone number 2322 . It is to be appreciated that the inventory database 2310 contains an actual physical address or location and not a mailing or P.O. Box type address. Furthermore, it is to be appreciated that in some instances the FDS 2304 may not be able to provide a complete suspect telephone number 2322 , in which case the location of the fraud may only be narrowed to the CLLI location 2334 , 2336 , or the area encompassed by the NPA 2328 by the location/GPS engine 2308 .      Similar to the searching of the inventory database 2310 by the location/GPS engine 2308 for a physical address associated with a suspect telephone number 2322 , a billing database 2312 may also be searched and correlated with the information obtained from the inventory database 2310 . FIG. 23D illustrates sample records from an exemplary billing database 2312 that may be used in an embodiment according to the present invention. Such a database as that shown in FIG. 23D is comprised of the telephone number 2338 and the mailing address 2340 of the location where the bill for that telephone number 2338 is sent. Such databases are maintained by telecommunications providers and may be available as “phonebook” databases that may be downloaded from the Internet or purchased from telecommunications providers or publishers of telephone books. It is to be appreciated that telephone book information may not be as complete as information controlled by a telecommunications provider because of the ability to have non-published numbers. It is also to be appreciated that the billing address 2340 is not necessarily the same as the premise location 2326 as described in relation to FIG. 23C , above. For instance, the bill may be sent to a P.O. Box rather than a street address. Also, a corporation with many different physical sites may have their bills for services such as telephone sent to a centralized accounting department. The suspect telephone number 2322 from the fraud database is searched against the telephone numbers 2338 in the billing database 2312 in an attempt to find a billing address 2340 for that number 2322 . In one embodiment, once a matching address is found, an algorithm is executed by the location/GPS engine 2308 to obtain coordinates (e.g., GPS, vertical and horizontal coordinates, etc.) for the billing address, if possible, and as such algorithms are known in the art.      The location/GPS engine 2308 then uses the cumulative information derived from the fraud database 2306 , the inventory database 2310 , and the billing database 2312 to form a mapping database 2314 . Collectively, the inventory database 2310 and the billing database 2312 may be considered as a location database 2316 because their function in the exemplary system of FIG. 23A is to provide location information. An exemplary mapping database structure and exemplary records contained therein are shown in FIG. 23E , which may be used in an embodiment according to the present invention. The mapping database 2314 of FIG. 23E is comprised of complaint information 2342 , address information 2344 , an identifier 2346 that indicates whether the address is associated with the origination or termination of a suspected fraud activity, a database record identifier 348 , and an associated database record identifier 2350 . The associated database record identifier 2350 in coordination with the origination/termination identifier 2346 allows the graphical representation between the origination location of complaint/fraud activities and the termination of such activities. It is to be appreciated that the address information 2344 is the best physical address of the fraud location as determined by the location/GPS engine 2308 from the inventory database 2310 and the billing database 2312 . For instance, in order of priority, the physical address 2326 from inventory database 2310 is more accurate than a billing address 2340 from the billing database 2312 , which is more accurate than the CLLI (location) 2334 , 2336 , which is more accurate than the NXX range location, which is more accurate than the NPA range location, which is more accurate than simple guessing. Although the address information 2344 of FIG. 23E is generally shown as street-type addresses, it is to be appreciated that in various embodiments the address information 2344 may be in the form of coordinates such as GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude), horizontal and vertical coordinates, etc. It is also to be appreciated that the complaint information 2342 may be in the form of a code or standardized terms in various embodiments according to the present invention such that mapping icons, codes or color schemes may be used to illustrate the severity or character of the complaint or fraud. The mapping database 2314 provides information for mapping the complaint and fraud activities using a mapping computer program operating on a computing device. It is contemplated within the scope of this invention that information contained in the mapping database 2314 may be in various formats and varying order to accommodate the mapping computer program used in an embodiment according to the present invention.       FIG. 24 is an overview flowchart used to explain the steps of an exemplary process for geographic mapping of fraud activities based on information obtained from records related to telephone calls and location information correlation. The process begins at step 2400 . At step 2402 , call record information is reviewed to look for characteristics and patterns of fraudulent activities as such characteristics may be known. At step 2404 , call information of suspected fraud activities is associated with at least one geographical location. At step 2406 , the location information obtained at step 2404 is used to graphically designate a geographic point or area on an electronic map by a mapping computer program operating on the processor of a computing device and capable of displaying the geographic information associated with the suspected fraudulent activity. The process ends at step 2408 .       FIG. 25 is a flowchart used to explain the steps of an alternate exemplary process for geographic mapping of fraud activities based on CDR and location information correlation. The process begins at step 2500 . At step 2502 , a CDR is reviewed to look for characteristics and patterns of fraudulent activities as such characteristics may be known. In one embodiment, this review is performed by an algorithm executing on a computing device. At step 2504 , a suspected fraudulent activity is identified and at least the originating telephone number associated with the suspected fraudulent activity is extracted from the CDR. In other instances, other telephone numbers associated with the same suspected fraudulent activity may be obtained, such as the terminating number of repetitive nuisance calls or credit card fraud over the telephone. At Step 2506 , the one or more telephone numbers obtained in step 2504 are matched against inventory and billing records to find a physical (geographic) location associated with each telephone number. At step 2508 , the location information obtained at step 2506 for each telephone number is used to graphically designate a geographic point or area on an electronic map by a mapping computer program operating on the processor of a computing device and capable of displaying the geographic information associated with the suspected fraudulent activity. The process ends at step 2510 .      It is to be appreciated that while the embodiments according to the invention have thus far been generally described in relation to a public service telephone network (PSTN) or a plain old telephone system (POTS), they are equally applicable to telecommunications occurring over systems such as voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) and wireless systems using, for example, code division multiple access (CDMA) or global system for mobile communications (GSM). Detail records of phone calls are kept for these systems that are analogous to the CDR kept for PSTN systems and likewise can be analyzed and reviewed for suspected fraud activities. In the case of VoIP, IP address location may be found using, for example RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) information, and other means described herein. RADIUS is an authentication, authorization and accounting protocol for applications such as network access or IP mobility that is intended to work in both local and roaming situations. Likewise, call detail records are kept for calls between mobile devices and information in such records may be used to locate the billing address of the owner of the mobile device and, if useful, the location of the cells associated with communication involving the mobile device(s).       FIG. 26 shows a process for layered geographic mapping of threats comprised of intrusion information and fraud information consistent with the embodiments according to the present invention. The process begins at step 2600 . At step 2602 , intrusion information is received such as from a computer administrator, as the output of software designed to detect intrusions, from an intrusion detection system, router, network management system, security information manager, or from any other source. In one embodiment, the intrusion information may include an identification (such as the IP address) of the computer where the intrusion started or ended, the name and description of the intrusion, and possibly other data. At step 2604 and upon receipt of the intrusion information, it is stored in an intrusion database. FIG. 4 shows one embodiment of intrusion information within the intrusion database.      At step 2606 , fraud information is received such as from a network, as the output of software designed to detect fraud, from a fraud detection system, switching system, network management system, security information manager, or from any other source. In one embodiment, the fraud information may include a description of the suspected fraud and one or more telephone numbers suspected of either originating the fraud or the number where the fraud terminates. At step 2608 and upon receipt of the fraud information, it is stored in a fraud database. FIG. 23B shows one embodiment of fraud information within the fraud database.      Returning to FIG. 26 , at step 2614 location information is obtained for the information stored in the intrusion database and the fraud database. This process has previously been described for fraud information involving PSTNs in reference to FIGS. 22B and 23A . In regard to threat information, VoIP, and other Internet-facilitated communications, computing device 2202 retrieves, for computers (or network points) at which a threat or telephone call started or ended, CDR information for that computer (or network point) from an CDR database in instances in which the network address of the computer at which the threat started or ended comprises an IP address. In one embodiment, the threat or call information (such as the IP address) maybe used as a key to retrieve the appropriate record from CDR database. The CDR information may include wireless location data associated with the network point at which the threat or call started or ended, as necessary. FIG. 5 shows one exemplary embodiment of the CDR information within the CDR database.      In instances in which the CDR information identifies a cellular tower or other fixed network entity as servicing the call but does not provide more specific GPS data, at step 2616 computing device 2202 may also retrieve geographic location information for the cellular tower or other fixed network entity, from location database 2212 , 2232 . As above, this process has already been described in relation to an embodiment in which the threat data includes a network address, such as an IP address, of the computer at which the threat started or ended, however, the fraud information may provide a telephone number of a device involved in a call that is being investigated for fraud. In this instance, a customer database may be consulted to determine an address or other physical location associated with the telephone number. In either instance, the resulting location information may include such information as the physical location (e.g., mailing address or GPS coordinates) for the identified network point or computer.      Once the location information has been retrieved from databases for the intrusion and fraud events, it is stored in a map database at step 2618 . Within map database the retrieved information is preferably correlated such that all information for a particular intrusion, fraud or other threat is stored in a record for that intrusion. For example, FIG. 23E shows exemplary database entries of records of map information for mapping fraud events, such as may be stored in map database and FIG. 7 shows exemplary database entries of records of map information for mapping intrusion events, such as may be stored in map database. As shown in FIG. 7 , map database records for intrusion events may contain the intrusion information, the network address (such as the IP address from CDR database), and the physical location, such as the mailing address or GPS information (also from CDR database or from location database). It is to be appreciated that location information for any information in the map database may be in the form or coordinates or as a described address or location. In addition, map database intrusion records may also include a status of the intrusion and an indication of the response person or team assigned to respond to the intrusion and map database fraud records may contain a description or code that identifies the fraud event that occurred or is suspected to have occurred.      Upon correlating this information within map database, computing device then maps the location of the intrusion, fraud \n"

[2] It was in regard to re-analyzing the statements given to police at Notting Hill police station, England , in 1949 in the case of an alleged murder by Evans. Evans was suspected of murdering his wife and baby and was tried and hanged for the crime. Yet, when Svartvik studied the statements allegedly given by Evans, he found that there were different stylistic markers involved, and Evans did not actually give the statements to the police officers as had been stated at the trial. [3] Sparked by this case, early forensic linguistics in the UK were focused on questioning the validity of police interrogations. As seen in numerous famous cases (e.g. the convictions of Derek Bentley, the Guildford Four, the Bridgewater Three, etc.), many of the major concerns were of the statements police officers used. Numerous times, the topic of police register came up – this meaning the type of stylist language and vocabulary used by officers of the law when transcribing witness statements. [3] Moving to the US and the beginnings of the field of forensic linguistics, the field really began with the 1963 case of Ernesto Miranda. His case led to the creation of Miranda Rights and pushed focus of forensic linguistics on witness questioning rather than police statements. Various cases came about that challenged whether or not suspects truly understood what their rights meant – leading to a distinction of coercive versus voluntary interrogations. [3]  During the early days of forensic linguistics in the United Kingdom, the legal defense for many criminal cases questioned the authenticity of police statements. At the time, customary police procedure for taking suspects' statements dictated that it be in a specific format, rather than in the suspect's own words. Statements by witnesses are very seldom made in a coherent or orderly fashion, with speculation and backtracking done out loud. The delivery is often too fast-paced, causing important details to be left out. Forensic linguistics can be traced back as early as a 1927 to a ransom note in Corning, New York. As the Associated Press reported [4] in \"Think Corning Girl Wrote Ransom Note\" \"Duncan McLure, of Johnson City uncle of the (kidnapped) girl, is the only member of the family to spell his name 'McLure' instead of 'McClure.' The letter he received, supposedly from the kidnappers, was addressed to him by the proper name, indicating that the writer was familiar with the difference in spelling.\"  Other work of forensic linguistics in the United States concerned the rights of individuals with regard to understanding their Miranda rights during the interrogation process. [5] An early application of forensic linguistics in the United States was related to the status of trademarks as words or phrases in the language. One of the bigger cases involved fast food giant McDonald's claiming that it had originated the process of attaching unprotected words to the 'Mc' prefix (referred to as McWords ) and was unhappy with Quality Inns International's intention of opening a chain of economy hotels to be called 'McSleep'. [6]  In the 1980s, Australian linguists discussed the application of linguistics and sociolinguistics to legal issues. [3] They discovered that a phrase such as ' the same language ' is open to interpretation. Aboriginal people have their own understanding and use of 'English', something that is not always appreciated by speakers of the dominant version of English, i.e., 'white English'. The Aboriginal people also bring their own culturally-based interactional styles to the interview. The 2000s saw a considerable shift in the field of forensic linguistics, which has been described as a coming-of-age of the discipline. Not only does the field have professional associations such as the International Association of Forensic Linguistics (IAFL) founded in 1993, and the Austrian Association for Legal Linguistics (AALL) founded in 2017, [7] it can now provide the scientific community with a range of textbooks such as Coulthard and Johnson (2007), Gibbons (2003) and Olsson (2008). [8]   Areas of study [ edit ]  The range of topics within forensic linguistics is diverse, but research occurs in the following areas:  The language of legal texts [ edit ]  The study of the language of legal texts encompasses a wide range of forensic texts. That includes the study of text types and forms of analysis. Any text or item of spoken language can potentially be a forensic text when it is used in a legal or criminal context. [2] This includes analysing the linguistics of documents as diverse as Acts of Parliament (or other law-making body), private wills, court judgements and summonses and the statutes of other bodies, such as States and government departments. One important area [ original research? ] is that of the transformative effect of Norman French and Ecclesiastic Latin on the development of the English common law, and the evolution of the legal specifics associated with it.  It can also refer to the ongoing attempts at making legal language more comprehensible to laypeople. [ citation needed ]  A forensic linguistics understanding of the relationship between language and law has been voiced by Leisser who states that  \"It is indeed hard to deny that the rule of law is in fact the rule of language. It seems that there cannot be law without language. Kelsen (1945: 161) wrote that '[j]ust as everything King Midas touched turned into gold, everything to which the law refers becomes law, i.e. something legally e x i s t i n g'. The concept of law is conveyed and mediated entirely through the structures of human language and it is thus plausible to assume that everything the law touches is therefore also touched by language. This is particularly evident in the fact that all processes of legal meaning-making and meaning-seeking are inextricably tied to the language system. ... [L]aw is defined as a set of linguistic signs which is ascribed the societal power to control human conduct.\" [9]  One part of the language of legal texts encompasses the Miranda warning in the United States. These warnings let the defendant know that they have the right to be silent since whatever they say from the point they are in police custody can and will be used against them in a court of law. The recipients who are advised of these rights must have a certain level of competency in the English language in order to completely understand the warning. [10]   The language of legal processes [ edit ]  Among other things, this area examines language as it is used in cross-examination, evidence presentation, judge's direction, police cautions, police testimonies in court, summing up to a jury, interview techniques, the questioning process in court and in other areas such as police interviews. Police officers use specific language to elicit certain responses from civilians. Because of a police officers' social stature, and the way they often phrase \"requests\" as \"commands\", people may be confused as to what their rights are when they are being questioned by police. Officers use linguistic tactics including putting the blame onto the victim and asking questions with ambiguous phrasing to elicit specific responses from people (Solan, L. & Tiersma, P, 2005). A defendant using ambiguity in the courtroom may present issues and be deemed unacceptable. Specifically, when a victim is invoking their right to a lawyer, there are directions stating that the request may not come off as ambiguous. In fact, if the request is not stated in a way that the officer deems to be clear, the victim may not receive their request for counsel at all. Refer to the following link to explore an example through the Louisiana vs. Demesme case. [11]  During the examination process, language plays a substantial role in the presentation of a story to the courtroom. Specifically, the language used by the lawyer to construct the story to the courtroom elicits specific responses from the witness, and specific emotions from the jury. For example, in an instance where a lawyer is examining a hostile witness, they will often use language to limit the response of the witness, in order to avoid having the witness present conflicting evidence. In this instance, yes/no questions will be targeted, and questions with room for elaboration, such as wh-formation questions, will likely be avoided. In a situation where a lawyer interviews a friendly witness whose testimony could potentially strengthen the story constructed by the lawyer, the opposite may occur where wh-questions are targeted to allow for elaboration (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013). Lawyers employs specific tactics for both themselves and their witnesses to come off as more or less truthful to the jury and the people of the courtroom. For example, the lawyer may refer to the witness by their first name or a nickname to humanize the witness, or they may speak using slang in order to create less social distance between himself and the courtroom. The lawyer may also avoid using slang, and instead use complicated law terminology to set himself apart from the courtroom and define his status (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013). The lawyer works in constructing the language of the legal process of the courtroom, and specific witnesses may respond to the lawyer's questions in different ways, eliciting new language tactics and opinions from the jury. For example, witnesses may use direct or indirect speech based on their previous societal experiences, gender differences, socioeconomic differences, or differences in education level. Using particular dialects, slang, or sentence formations could assist in making the witness more or less truthful to the jury (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013). Since language can be used to elicit responses in the legal process, the right to an interpreter plays a part in the fairness of the trial. \"The right to an interpreter is essentially a procedural right that derives from the right to a fair trial: everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to certain minimum procedural guarantees, and these include the right to the free assistance of an interpreter where s/he cannot understand or speak the language of the concerned court.\" [12]   Forensic text types [ edit ]  Emergency call [ edit ]  In an emergency call, the recipient or emergency operator's ability to extract primarily linguistic information in threatening situations and to come up with the required response in a timely manner is crucial to the successful completion of the call. Emphasis on intonation, voice pitch and the extent to which there is cooperation between the caller and the recipient at any one time are also very important in analyzing an emergency call. Full cooperation includes frank and timely responses. Urgency plays a role in emergency calls, so hesitations, signs of evasiveness, and incomplete or overly short answers indicate that the caller might be making a false or hoax call. A genuine call has distinctive interlocking and slight overlap of turns. The recipient trusts the caller to provide accurate information and the caller trusts the recipient to ask only pertinent questions. If the caller uses a rising pitch at the end of every turn, it might represent a lack of commitment; the recipient's use of a rising pitch indicates doubt or desire for clarification. The call ideally moves from nil knowledge on the part of the recipient to a maximum amount of knowledge in a minimum possible period of time. This makes the emergency call unlike any other kind of service encounter. [2]   Ransom demands \n"
