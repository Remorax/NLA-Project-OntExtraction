This British Standard has been developed by practitioners throughout
the business continuity community, drawing upon their academic,
technical and practical experiences of business continuity
management (BCM). It has been produced to provide a system based
on good practice for business continuity management. It is intended
to serve as a single reference point for most situations where business
continuity management is practised, and to be used by large, medium
and small organizations in industrial, commercial, public and voluntary
sectors.
This document constitutes Part 1 of BS 25999. At the time of
publication, Part 2 was in preparation which will specify requirements
for business continuity management.

As a code of practice, this British Standard takes the form of guidance
and recommendations. It should not be quoted as if it were a
specification and particular care should be taken to ensure that claims
of compliance are not misleading.
Any user claiming compliance with this British Standard is expected to
be able to justify any course of action that deviates from its
recommendations.

Presentational conventions
The provisions of this Standard are recommendations, which are
expressed in sentences in which the principal auxiliary verb is “should”.
Clause 3 does not contain any recommendations; rather, it gives useful
background information on business continuity management (though
the Standard is not intended as a beginner’s guide to business continuity
management).
The word “may” is used in the text to express permissibility, e.g. as an
alternative to the primary recommendation of the clause. The word
“can” is used to express possibility, e.g. a consequence of an action or
an event.
Supplementary commentary, explanation and general
informative material is presented in smaller italic type, and does
not constitute a normative element.

Contractual and legal considerations
This publication does not purport to include all the necessary provisions
of a contract. Users are responsible for its correct application.
Compliance with a British Standard cannot confer immunity
from legal obligations.

1 Scope and applicability
This British Standard establishes the process, principles and
terminology of business continuity management (BCM). The
purpose of this Standard is to provide a basis for understanding,
developing and implementing business continuity within an
organization and to provide confidence in the organization's dealings
with customers and other organizations. It also enables the organization
to measure its BCM capability in a consistent and recognized manner.
This Standard provides a system based on BCM good practice.
This Standard is intended for use by anyone with responsibility for
business operations or the provision of services, from top management
through all levels of the organization; from those with a single site to
those with a global presence; from sole traders and small-to-medium
enterprises (SMEs) to organizations employing thousands of people. It
is therefore applicable to anybody who holds responsibility for any
operation, and thus the continuity of that operation.
This Standard does not cover the activities of emergency planning
inasmuch as that topic relates to civil emergencies.
NOTE Ultimately, no matter how much effort or resource is invested in
business continuity management, an organization could still be faced with
an incident or combination of incidents it did not forsee.

2 Terms and definitions
For the purposes of this part of BS 25999, the following definitions
apply.

2.1

activity
process or set of processes undertaken by an organization (or on its
behalf) that produces or supports one or more products or services
NOTE Examples of such processes include accounts, call centre, IT,
manufacture, distribution.

2.2

business continuity
strategic and tactical capability of the organization to plan for and
respond to incidents and business disruptions in order to continue
business operations at an acceptable pre-defined level

2.3

business continuity management (BCM)
holistic management process that identifies potential threats to an
organization and the impacts to business operations that those threats,
if realized, might cause, and which provides a framework for building
organizational resilience with the capability for an effective response
that safeguards the interests of its key stakeholders, reputation, brand
and value-creating activities
NOTE Business continuity management involves managing the
recovery or continuation of business activities in the event of a business
disruption, and management of the overall programme through training,
exercises and reviews, to ensure the business continuity plan(s) stays
current and up-to-date.

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

NOTE 2 The word “probability” can be used instead of “likelihood” in some
non-English languages that have no direct equivalent. Because
“probability” is often interpreted more formally in English as a
mathematical term, “likelihood” is used throughout this Standard with the
intention that it is given the same broad interpretation as “probability”.

2.28

risk

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

something that might happen and its effect(s) on the achievement of
objectives
NOTE 1 The word “risk” is used colloquially in various ways, as a noun
(“a risk” or, in the plural, “risks”), a verb (to risk [something], or to put at
risk), or as an adjective (“risky”). Used as a noun the term “a risk” could
relate to either a potential event, its causes, the chance (likelihood) of
something happening, or the effects of such events. In risk management
(see 6.5) it is important to make a clear distinction between these various
usages of the word “risk”.
NOTE 2 Risk is defined relative to a particular objective; therefore,
concern for several objectives implies the possibility of more than one
measure of risk with respect to any source of risk.
NOTE 3 Risk is often quantified as an average effect by summing the
combined effect of each possible consequence weighted by the associated
likelihood of each consequence, to obtain an “expected value”. However,
probability distributions are needed to quantify perceptions about the
range of possible consequences. Alternatively, summary statistics, such as
standard deviation, may be used in addition to expected value.

2.29

risk appetite
total amount of risk that an organization is prepared to accept, tolerate
or be exposed to at any point in time

2.30

risk assessment
overall process of risk identification, analysis and evaluation

2.31

risk management
structured development and application of management culture, policy,
procedures and practices to the tasks of identifying, analysing,
evaluating, and controlling responding to risk

2.32

stakeholders
those with a vested interest in an organization’s achievements
NOTE This is a wide-ranging term that includes, but is not limited to,
internal and “outsourced” employees, customers, suppliers, partners,
employees, distributors, investors, insurers, shareholders, owners,
government and regulators.

2.33

top management
person or group of people who direct and control an organization at the
highest level [BS EN ISO 9000:2005]
NOTE Top management, especially in a large multinational
organization, might not be directly involved; however, top management
accountability through the chain of command is manifest. In a small
organization, top management might be the owner or sole proprietor.

3 Overview of business continuity
management (BCM)
3.1

What is BCM?

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

Business continuity management (BCM) is a business-owned,
business-driven process that establishes a fit-for-purpose strategic and
operational framework that:
•

proactively improves an organization’s resilience against the
disruption of its ability to achieve its key objectives;

•

provides a rehearsed method of restoring an organization’s ability
to supply its key products and services to an agreed level within
an agreed time after a disruption; and

•

delivers a proven capability to manage a business disruption and
protect the organization’s reputation and brand.

While the individual processes of business continuity can change with
an organization’s size, structures and responsibilities, the basic
principles remain exactly the same for voluntary, private or public
sector organizations, regardless of their size, scope or complexity.

3.2

BCM and organizational strategy
All organizations, whether large or small, have aims and objectives, such
as to grow, to provide services and to acquire other businesses. These
aims and objectives are generally met via strategic plans to achieve an
organization’s short, medium and long term goals. BCM understanding
at an organization’s highest level will ensure that these aims and
objectives are not compromised by unexpected disruptions.
The consequences of an incident vary and can be far-reaching. These
consequences might involve loss of life, loss of assets or income, or the
inability to deliver products and services on which the organization’s
strategy, reputation or even survival might depend.
BCM needs to recognize the strategic importance of known
stakeholders. Furthermore, as the consequences of a disruption
unfold, new stakeholders emerge and have a direct impact on the
eventual extent of the damage. For example, issue groups may attempt
to apply pressure on the organization facing a disruption.
All these issues are of strategic concern to the organization.

3.3

BCM – the relationship with risk management
BCM is complementary to a risk management framework that sets out
to understand the risks to operations or business, and the consequences
of those risks.
Risk management seeks to manage risk around the key products and
services that an organization delivers. Product and service delivery can
be disrupted by a wide variety of incidents, many of which are difficult
to predict or analyse by cause.

6 • © BSI 2006

BS 25999-1:2006

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

By focusing on the impact of disruption, BCM identifies those products
and services on which the organization depends for its survival, and can
identify what is required for the organization to continue to meet its
obligations. Through BCM, an organization can recognize what needs to
be done before an incident occurs to protect its people, premises,
technology, information, supply chain, stakeholders and reputation.
With that recognition, the organization can then take a realistic view on
the responses that are likely to be needed as and when a disruption
occurs, so that it can be confident that it will manage through any
consequences without unacceptable delay in delivering its products or
services.
An organization with appropriate BCM measures in place might be able
to take advantage of opportunities which have a high risk.

3.4

Why an organization should undertake BCM
BCM forms an important element of good business management,
service provision and entrepreneurial prudence.
Managers and owners have the responsibility to maintain the ability of
the organization to function without disruption. Organizations
constantly make commitments or have a duty to deliver products and
services, i.e. they enter into contracts and otherwise raise expectations.
All organizations have moral and social responsibilities, particularly
where they provide an emergency response or a public or voluntary
service. In some cases, organizations have statutory or regulatory duties
to undertake BCM.
All business activity is subject to disruptions, such as technology failure,
flooding, utility disruption and terrorism. BCM provides the capability
to adequately react to operational disruptions while protecting welfare
and safety.
BCM ought now to be regarded, not as a costly planning process, but as
one that adds value to the organization.

3.5

The benefits of an effective BCM programme
The benefits of an effective BCM programme are that the organization:
•

is able to proactively identify the impacts of an operational
disruption;

•

has in place an effective response to disruptions which minimizes
the impact on the organization;

•

maintains an ability to manage uninsurable risks;

•

encourages cross-team working;

•

is able to demonstrate a credible response through a process of
exercising;

•

could enhance its reputation; and

•

might gain a competitive advantage, conferred by the
demonstrated ability to maintain delivery.

3.6

The outcomes of an effective BCM programme

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

The outcomes of an effective BCM programme are that:

3.7

•

key products and services are identified and protected, ensuring
their continuity;

•

an incident management capability is enabled to provide an
effective response;

•

the organization’s understanding of itself and its relationships with
other organizations, relevant regulators or government
departments, local authorities and the emergency services is
properly developed, documented and understood;

•

staff are trained to respond effectively to an incident or disruption
through appropriate exercising;

•

stakeholder requirements are understood and able to be delivered;

•

staff receive adequate support and communications in the event of
a disruption;

•

the organization’s supply chain is secured;

•

the organization’s reputation is protected; and

•

the organization remains compliant with its legal and regulatory
obligations.

Elements of the business continuity
management lifecycle
The BCM lifecycle comprises six elements, as illustrated by Figure 1.
These can be implemented by organizations of all sizes, in all sectors:
public, private, non-profit, educational, manufacturing, etc. The scope
and structure of a BCM programme can vary, and the effort expended
will be tailored to the needs of the individual organization, but these
essential elements still have to be undertaken.
a) BCM programme management (see Clause 5)
Programme management enables the business continuity capability to
be both established (if necessary) and maintained in a manner
appropriate to the size and complexity of the organization.
b) Understanding the organization (see Clause 6)
The activities associated with “Understanding the organization” provide
information that enables prioritization of an organization’s products
and services and the urgency of the activities that are required to deliver
them. This sets the requirements that will determine the selection of
appropriate BCM strategies.

c) Determining business continuity strategy (see Clause 7)
Determining business continuity strategy enables a range of strategies
to be evaluated. This allows an appropriate response to be chosen for
each product or service, such that the organization can continue to
deliver those products and services:
•

at an acceptable level of operation; and

•

within an acceptable timeframe

during and following a disruption. The choice made will take account of
the resilience and countermeasure options already present within the
organization.

BS 25999-1:2006
COMMENTARY ON 3.7d)
The term “incident” is used
throughout this Standard to reflect
the scalability of events, from small
to large which can affect an
organization. A single incident or
series of incidents can result in
serious disruptions to the
organization’s ability to meet its
obligations. If an incident is
managed well it might not develop
into a crisis. However, some events
will cause such a profound
disruption to the organization’s
objectives as to be considered a
crisis immediately.
An incident might exceed the
preparedness of an organization,
even if it has carefully examined
response measures against an
anticipated level of damage. It is
therefore imperative that
management and its supporting
structures do not adhere stubbornly
to an existing plan, but make
judgments according to the
circumstances. A business
continuity plan is never a
substitute for informed and
competent management
decision-making.

d) Developing and implementing a BCM response (see Clause 8)
Developing and implementing a BCM response results in the creation of
a management framework and a structure of incident management,
business continuity and business recovery plans that detail the steps to
be taken during and after an incident to maintain or restore operations.
e) BCM exercising, maintaining and reviewing BCM
arrangements (see Clause 9)
BCM exercising, maintenance, review and audit leads to the
organization being able to:
•

demonstrate the extent to which its strategies and plans are
complete, current and accurate; and

•

identify opportunities for improvement.

f) Embedding BCM in the organization’s culture (see Clause 10)
Embedding BCM in the organization’s culture enables BCM to
become part of the organization’s core values and instils confidence
in all stakeholders in the ability of the organization to cope with
disruptions.

4 The business continuity management
policy
4.1
COMMENTARY ON 4.1
The purposes of establishing a
business continuity policy are to:
w
ensure that all BCM activities
are conducted and
implemented in an agreed and
controlled manner;
w
achieve a business continuity
capability that meets changing
business needs and is
appropriate to the size,
complexity and nature of the
organization; and
w
put in place a clearly defined
framework for the ongoing BCM
capability.

10 • © BSI 2006

Overview
4.1.1 The BCM policy defines the following processes:
•

the set-up activities for establishing a business continuity
capability; and

•

the ongoing management and maintenance of the business
continuity capability.

4.1.2 The set-up activities incorporate the specification, end-to-end
design, build, implementation and initial exercising of the business
continuity capability.
4.1.3 The ongoing maintenance and management activities include
embedding business continuity within the organization, exercising
plans regularly, and updating and communicating them, particularly
when there is significant change in premises, personnel, process,
market, technology or organizational structure.

BS 25999-1:2006

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

4.2

Context
The organization should ensure that its BCM policy is appropriate to the
nature, scale, complexity, geography and criticality of its business
activities and that it reflects its culture, dependencies and operating
environment. The BCM policy defines the process requirements to
ensure that business continuity arrangements continue to meet the
needs of the organization in the event of an incident. This policy should
ensure that a business continuity capability is promoted within the
organization’s culture. The BCM capability should be integrated into the
organization’s change management activity so that it is incorporated
into the growth and development of the organization’s products and
services.

4.3

Development of the business continuity policy
The organization should develop its business continuity policy which
states the objectives of BCM within the organization. Initially, this may
be a high level statement of intent which is refined and enhanced as the
capability is developed.
The business continuity policy should provide the organization with
documented principles to which it will aspire and against which its
business continuity capability should be measured. The BCM policy
should be owned at a high level, e.g. a board director or elected
representative.
The organization may consider the following when developing its BCM
policy:
•

defining the scope of BCM within the organization;

•

BCM resourcing;

•

defining the BCM principles, guidelines and minimum standards
for the organization;

•

referencing any relevant standards, regulations or policies that
have to be included or can be used as a benchmark.

The organization should maintain and regularly review its BCM policy,
strategies, plans and solutions on a regular basis in line with the
organization's needs.
The scope of the BCM policy should clearly define any limitations or
exclusions that apply, e.g. geographical or product exclusions.

4.4

Scope of the BCM programme
Top management may determine the scope of the BCM programme by
identifying the key products and services that support the
organization’s objectives, obligations and statutory duties.
Determination of what is key should be consistent with the business
impact analysis described in 6.2, albeit at a higher level of
consideration.

Outsourced activities

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

If a product, service or activity has been outsourced, the risk
accountability for that product, service or activity remains vested within
the organization. Consequently, an organization should assure itself that
its key suppliers or outsource partners have effective BCM
arrangements in place. One method of doing this is to obtain audited
evidence of the viability of key suppliers’ continuity plans and their
exercising and maintenance programmes.

culture.

5.1

Overview
A BCM programme should be put in place to achieve the objectives
defined in the business continuity policy (see 4.3). BCM programme
management involves three steps:

5.2

•

assigning responsibilities (see 5.2);

•

implementing business continuity in the organization (see 5.3);
and

•

the ongoing management of business continuity (see 5.4).

Assigning responsibilities (governance)
5.2.1 The organization’s management should:
•

appoint or nominate a person with appropriate seniority and
authority to be accountable for BCM policy and implementation;
and

•

appoint or nominate one or more individuals to implement and
maintain the BCM programme.

COMMENTARY ON 5.2.1
Individuals tasked with implementing and maintaining the business
continuity programme may reside in many areas of an organization
depending on its size, scale and complexity. It is essential, however, that
a person with appropriate authority (e.g. owner, board director or elected
representative) has overall responsibility for BCM and is directly
accountable for ensuring the continued success of this capability.

5.2.2 If the organization’s structure so indicates, top management may
nominate representatives across the business by function or location to
assist in the implementation of the BCM programme.
The roles, accountabilities, responsibilities and authorities should be
integrated into job descriptions and skill sets.
The organization’s audit process should review these responsibilities.

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

These responsibilities may be reinforced by including them in the
organization’s appraisal, reward and recognition policy.
COMMENTARY ON 5.2.2
In large organizations there might be a need for a team of business
continuity representatives with differing roles and responsibilities. In
smaller organizations, responsibility for business continuity may reside
with one or more individuals.

5.3

Implementing business continuity in the
organization
5.3.1 Activities to implement a business continuity programme should
include the design, build, and implementation of the programme.
The organization should:
•

communicate the programme to stakeholders;

•

arrange or provide appropriate training for staff; and

•

exercise the business continuity capability (see Clause 9).

5.3.2 The organization may adopt a recognized project management
method to ensure that the implementation is effectively managed

5.4
5.4.1

Ongoing management
Overview
Ongoing management activities should ensure that business continuity
is embedded within the organization. Each component of an
organization’s business continuity capability should be regularly
reviewed, exercised and updated. In addition, business continuity
arrangements and plans should also be reviewed and updated whenever
there is a significant change in the organization’s operating
environment, personnel, processes or technology, and when an exercise
or incident highlights deficiencies.

5.4.2

Ongoing maintenance
However BCM is resourced, there are activities that should be carried
out both initially and on an ongoing basis. These may include:

14 • © BSI 2006

•

defining the scope, roles and responsibilities for BCM;

•

appointing an appropriate person or team to manage the ongoing
BCM capability;

•

keeping the business continuity programme current through good
practice;

•

promoting business continuity across the organization and wider,
where appropriate;

•

administering the exercise programme;

5.5

•

coordinating the regular review and update of the business
continuity capability, including reviewing or reworking risk
assessments and business impact analyses (BIAs);

•

maintaining documentation appropriate to the size and complexity
of the organization (see 5.5);

•

monitoring performance of the business continuity capability;

•

managing costs associated with the business continuity capability;
and

•

establishing and monitoring change management and succession
management regimes.

BCM documentation
Individuals tasked with maintaining business continuity should create
and maintain the business continuity documentation. This may include
the following:
a) BCM policy:
•

BCM scope statement,

•

BCM terms of reference;

b) business impact analysis (BIA);
c)

risk and threat assessment;

d) BCM strategy/strategies;
e)

awareness programme;

f)

training programme;

g) incident management plans;
h) business continuity plans;
i)

business recovery plans;

j)

exercise schedule and reports;

k) service level agreements and contracts.

Exercising,

and reviewing

The aim of this element of the BCM lifecycle is to assist the
understanding of the organization through the identification of
its key products and services and the critical activities and
resources that support them. This element ensures that the
BCM programme is aligned to the organization’s objectives,
obligations and statutory duties.

6.1

Introduction
6.1.1 In a business continuity context, an understanding of the
organization comes from:
•

identifying the organization’s objectives, stakeholder obligations,
statutory duties and the environment in which the organization
operates;

•

identifying the activities, assets and resources, including those
outside the organization, that support the delivery of these
products and services;

•

assessing the impact and consequences over time of the failure of
these activities, assets and resources (see 6.2);

•

identifying and evaluating the perceived threats that could disrupt
the organization’s key products and services and the critical
activities, assets and resources that support them (see 6.5).

6.1.2 It is important that the organization understands:
a) the interdependencies of its activities, and
b) any reliance it has on external organizations, and any reliance
placed upon it by others.

6.2

Business impact analysis (BIA)
6.2.1 The organization should determine and document the impact of
a disruption to the activities that support its key products and
services. This process is commonly referred to as a business impact
analysis (BIA).

16 • © BSI 2006

BS 25999-1:2006
6.2.2 For each activity supporting the delivery of key products and
services within the scope of its BCM programme, the organization
should:

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

a) assess over time the impacts that would occur if the activity was
disrupted;
COMMENTARY ON 6.2.2b)
During a disruption, impacts
generally increase over time and
affect each activity differently.
Impacts might also vary depending
on the day, month or point in the
business lifecycle.

b) establish the maximum tolerable period of disruption of each
activity by identifying:

c)

•

the maximum time period after the start of a disruption within
which the activity needs to be resumed,

•

the minimum level at which the activity needs to be performed
on its resumption,

•

the length of time within which normal levels of operation
need to be resumed;

identify any inter-dependent activities, assets, supporting
infrastructure or resources that have also to be maintained
continuously or recovered over time.

6.2.3 When assessing impacts, the organization should consider those
that relate to its business aims and objectives and its stakeholders.
These may include:
•

the impact on staff or public wellbeing;

•

the impact of damage to, or loss of, premises, technology or
information;

•

the impact of breaches of statutory duties or regulatory
requirements;

•

damage to reputation;

•

damage to financial viability;

•

deterioration of product or service quality;

•

environmental damage.

The organization should document its approach to assessing the impact
of disruption and its findings and conclusions.

6.3
COMMENTARY ON 6.3
The maximum time period for
resuming activities can vary
between seconds and several
months depending on the nature of
the activity. Activities that are
time-sensitive might need to be
specified with a great degree of
accuracy, e.g. to the minute or the
hour. Less time-sensitive activities
might require less accuracy.

Identification of critical activities
The organization may categorize its activities according to their priority
for recovery. Those activities whose loss, as identified during the BIA,
would have the greatest impact in the shortest time and which need to
be recovered most rapidly may be termed “critical activities”. Each
critical activity supports one or more key products or services.
The organization may wish to focus its planning activities on critical
activities, but should recognize that other activities will also need to be
recovered within their maximum tolerable period of disruption and
might also require advance arrangements to be in place.

The maximum tolerable period of
disruption will influence each
activity’s recovery time objective
when determining BCM strategies
(see Clause 7).

6.4
COMMENTARY ON 6.4
Technology implies the use of
equipment in the broadest sense
and as relevant to the
organization. Technology might
include, but is not limited to, IT
software and hardware,
telecommunications equipment,
lathes, food preparation machines,
vacuum sealing machinery or any
other plant and machinery
essential to manufacturing and
production capability.
If records or work-in-progress
information are unavailable,
inaccurate, or not
sufficiently up-to-date, this could
prevent or critically delay the
resumption of activities. The
requirements for providing such
information are used to formulate
appropriate back-up and records
management strategies when
determining BCM strategies (see
Clause 7).

6.5
COMMENTARY ON 6.5
It might be beneficial to consult
risk registers that have already
been established elsewhere in the
organization or by external bodies.

Determining continuity requirements
The organization should estimate the resources that each activity will
require on resumption. These may include:
a) staff resources, including numbers, skills and knowledge (people);
b) the works site and facilities required (premises);
c) supporting technology, plant and equipment (technology);
d) provision of information (whether electronic or paper-based)
about previous work or current work-in-progress, all of which is
sufficiently up-to-date and accurate to allow the activity to
continue effectively at the agreed level (information); and
e) external services and suppliers (supplies).
The organization should take into account the needs of stakeholders
when determining resource levels.

Evaluating threats to critical activities
(undertaking a risk assessment)
6.5.1 In a BCM context, the level of risk should be understood
specifically in respect of the organization’s critical activities and the
risk of a disruption to these. Critical activities are underpinned by
resources such as people, premises, technology, information, supplies
and stakeholders. The organization should understand the threats to
these resources, the vulnerabilities of each resource, and the impact
that would arise if a threat became an incident and caused a business
disruption.
6.5.2 It is entirely the decision of the organization which risk
assessment approach is chosen, but it is important that the approach is
suitable and appropriate to address all of the organization’s
requirements.
6.5.3 BS ISO/IEC 27001 sets the framework for the risk assessment
approach to be chosen by describing the mandatory elements that the
risk assessment process should contain. Typical elements are as
follows.

18 • © BSI 2006

•

Determination of the criteria for risk acceptance. These describe
the circumstances under which the organization is willing to
accept risks.

•

Identification of acceptable levels of risk. Whatever risk
assessment approach is chosen, the organization needs to identify
the levels of risk that it considers acceptable.

BS 25999-1:2006
•

Analysis of the risks. It is necessary that the organization's risk
assessment approach addresses all the concepts discussed in
6.5.4, 6.5.5 and 6.5.6.

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

6.5.4 Specific threats may be described as events or actions which
could, at some point, cause an impact to the resources, e.g. threats
such as fire, flood, power failure, staff loss, staff absenteeism,
computer viruses and hardware failure.
6.5.5 Vulnerabilities might occur as weaknesses within the resources
and can, at some point be exploited by the threats, e.g. single points of
failure, inadequacies in fire protection, electrical resilience, staffing
levels, IT security and IT resilience.
6.5.6 Impacts (see 6.2.3) might result from the exploitation of
vulnerabilities by threats.

6.6
6.6.1

Determining choices
Overview
As a result of the BIA and the risk assessment, the organization should
identify measures that:
•

reduce the likelihood of a disruption;

•

shorten the period of disruption; and

•

limit the impact of a disruption on the organization’s key products
and services.

These measures are known as loss mitigation and risk treatment.
Loss mitigation strategies can be used in conjunction with other
options, as not all risks can be prevented or reduced to an acceptable
level. The organization might include one or more or all of the strategies
in 6.6.2 to 6.6.5 for each critical activity.

6.6.2

Business continuity
If business continuity is the chosen strategy for a key product or service,
a recovery time objective (RTO) should be established and the
continuity strategies in Clause 7 should be evaluated against this
objective.
Continuity strategies seek to improve the organization’s resilience to a
disruption by ensuring critical activities continue at, or are recovered
to, an acceptable minimum level and to timeframes stipulated within
the BIA.

© BSI 2006 •

19

BS 25999-1:2006
6.6.3

Acceptance

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

A risk might be acceptable without any further action being taken. Even
if it is not acceptable, the ability to do anything about some risks could
be limited, or the cost of taking any action disproportionate to the
potential benefit gained. In these cases the response may be to tolerate
the existing level of risk if top management deems the risk to be
acceptable and within the organization’s risk appetite. In some
circumstances the impact of a risk might be outside the organization’s
normal risk appetite, but, due to the low likelihood of the risk occurring
and/or the uneconomic cost of control, top management may accept the
risk.
Acceptance may be supplemented by a plan for handling the impacts
that will arise if the risk is realized.

6.6.4

Transfer
For some risks the best response may be to transfer them. This might
be done by conventional insurance or contractual arrangements, or it
might be done by paying a third party to take the risk in another way.
This option is particularly good for mitigating financial risks or risks to
assets. Risks may be transferred in order to reduce the risk exposure of
the organization or because another organization is more capable of
effectively managing the risk. It is important to note that some risks are
not (fully) transferable; in particular, it is generally not possible to
transfer reputational risk, even if the delivery of a service is contracted
out.
The purchase of insurance may form part of a risk treatment strategy
and will provide some financial recompense for some losses. However,
not all losses are fully insurable (e.g. uninsured incidents, damage to
brand or reputation, loss of stakeholder value, reduction in market
share and human consequences). A financial settlement alone is unlikely
to fully protect the organization in a manner that satisfies stakeholder
expectations. Insurance cover is more likely to be used in conjunction
with one or more other strategies.

6.6.5

Change, suspend or terminate
In some circumstances it might be appropriate to change, suspend or
terminate the service, product, activity, function or process. This option
ought only to be considered where there is no conflict with the
organization’s objectives, statutory compliance and stakeholder
expectation. This approach is most likely to be considered where a
service, product, activity, function or process has a limited lifespan.
NOTE The four items above are sometimes referred to as the “4 T” model:
“Treat” (business continuity), “Tolerate” (accept the risk), “Transfer” and
“Terminate”.

6.7

Sign-off
Top management should sign off the documented list of key products
and services, the business impact analysis and the risk assessment to
ensure that the work has been appropriate and is a true reflection of the
organization.

7.1
COMMENTARY ON 7.1
Clause 7 and all following clauses
relate to those key products and
services for which business
continuity is the chosen option. In
all other cases (e.g. suspension,
termination, acceptance of risk),
the product or service is not
covered by a BCM approach and
cannot be considered compliant
with this Standard.

7.2

Introduction
The organization’s approach to determining BCM strategies should:
a) implement appropriate measures to reduce the likelihood of
incidents occurring and/or reduce the potential effects of those
incidents;
b) take due account of the resilience and mitigation measures;
c)

provide continuity for its critical activities during and following an
incident; and

d) take account of those activities that have not been identified as
critical.

Strategy options
7.2.1 The organization should consider strategic options for its critical
activities and the resources that each activity will require on its
resumption. The most appropriate strategy or strategies will depend on
a range of factors such as:
•

the maximum tolerable period of disruption of the critical activity;

•

the costs of implementing a strategy or strategies; and

•

the consequences of inaction.

7.2.2 Strategies might be required for the following organizational
resources:
•

people (see 7.3);

•

premises (see 7.4);

•

technology (see 7.5);

•

information (see 7.6);

•

supplies (see 7.7); and

•

stakeholders (see 7.8).
© BSI 2006 •

21

BS 25999-1:2006
In each case, the organization should minimize the likelihood of
implementing a business continuity solution that might be affected by
the same incident that causes the business disruption.

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

7.3

People
The organization should identify appropriate strategies for maintaining
core skills and knowledge. This analysis should extend beyond
employees to contractors and other stakeholders who possess extensive
specialist skills and knowledge. Strategies to protect or provide those
skills might include:
a) documentation of the way in which critical activities are
performed;
b) multi-skill training of staff and contractors;
c) separation of core skills to reduce the concentration of risk
(this might entail physical separation of staff with core skills or
ensuring that more than one person has the requisite core skills);
d) use of third parties;
e) succession planning; and
f)

7.4
COMMENTARY ON 7.4
Worksite strategies can vary
significantly and a range of
options might be available.
Different types of incident or threat
might require the implementation
of different or multiple worksite
options. The correct strategies will
in part be determined by the
organization’s size, sector and
spread of activities, by
stakeholders, and by geographical
base. For example, public
authorities will need to maintain a
frontline service delivery in their
communities.

knowledge retention and management.

Premises
The organization should devise a strategy for reducing the impact of the
unavailability of its normal worksite(s). This may include one or more
of the following:
a) alternative premises (locations) within the organization, including
displacement of other activities;
b) alternative premises provided by other organizations (whether or
not these are reciprocal arrangements);
c) alternative premises provided by third-party specialists;
d) working from home or at remote sites;
e) other agreed suitable premises; and
f)

use of an alternative workforce in an established site.

NOTE 1 If staff are to be moved to alternative premises, these premises
ought to be close enough that staff are willing and able to travel there,
taking into account any possible difficulties caused by the incident.
However, the alternative premises ought not to be so close that they are
likely to be affected by the same incident.
NOTE 2 The use of alternative premises for continuity purposes ought to
be supported by a clear statement as to whether the alternative premises
are for the sole use of the organization. If the alternative premises are
shared with other organizations, a plan to mitigate the non-availability of
these premises ought to be developed and documented.
NOTE 3 It may be appropriate to move the workload rather than the staff,
e.g. a manufacturing line or a call centre’s workload.

7.5

Technology

COMMENTARY ON 7.5.1
Technology strategies will vary
significantly between
organizations according to the size,
nature and complexity of business.
Specific strategies ought to be
developed to safeguard, replace or
restore specialized or custom built
technologies with long lead times.

7.5.1 Technology strategies will depend on the nature of the
technology employed and its relationship to critical activities, but will
typically be one or a combination of the following:

The organization may need to
make provision for manual
operations before full technology
services are recovered.

•

geographical spread of technology, i.e. maintaining the same
technology at different locations that will not be affected by the
same business disruption;

•

holding older equipment as emergency replacement or spares; and

•

additional risk mitigation for unique or long lead time equipment.

•

provision made within the organization;

•

services delivered to the organization; and

•

services provided externally by a third party.

7.5.2 Technology strategies may include:

7.5.3 Information technology (IT) services frequently need complex
continuity strategies. Where such strategies are required,
consideration should be given to:
•

recovery time objectives (RTOs) for systems and applications
which support the key activities identified in the BIA;

•

location and distance between technology sites;

•

number of technology sites;

•

remote access;

•

the use of un-staffed (dark) sites as opposed to staffed sites;

•

telecoms connectivity and redundant routing;

•

the nature of “failover” (whether manual intervention is required to
activate alternative IT provision or whether this needs to occur
automatically); and

•

third-party connectivity and external links.

NOTE 1 If a strategy of “failing over” from one site to another is adopted,
the network path distance between the two sites has to be carefully
considered as the distance between the sites could have a negative impact
on the way in which IT systems operate.
NOTE 2 Where more than one site hosts an organization’s IT, there may
be a mutual IT recovery strategy, so that the systems, network and storage
at each site is sized to cope with the combined traffic and work of the
other(s) in addition to its own work.
NOTE 3 Another solution to relocating people to alternative premises is
to provide them with remote access to IT via dial-up, or through the
Internet using Virtual Private Network (VPN) or similar technology.
NOTE 4 Further guidance on continuity for IT and telecommunications
hardware may be found in such documents as PAS 77, BS ISO/IEC 27001
and BS ISO/IEC 20000 (both parts).

© BSI 2006 •

23

BS 25999-1:2006
7.6

Information
Information strategies should be such as to ensure that information vital
to the organization’s operation is protected and recoverable according
to the timeframes described within the BIA.

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

NOTE 1 Further guidance is given in BS ISO/IEC 27001. The storage
and recovery of such information has to be compliant with relevant
legislation.

Any information required for enabling the delivery of the organization’s
critical activities should have appropriate:
•

confidentiality;

•

integrity;

•

availability; and

•

currency.

Information strategies should be documented for the recovery of
information that has not yet been copied or backed-up to a safe location.
•

Information strategies should extend to include:

•

physical (hardcopy) formats; and

•

virtual (electronic) formats, etc.

NOTE 2 In all cases, information needs to be recovered to a point in time
that is known and agreed by top management. Various methods of copying
may be used, such as electronic or tape backups, microfiche, photocopies,
creating dual copies at the time of production and so on. This known
recovery point is often referred to as the “recovery point objective”.

7.7
COMMENTARY ON 7.7
In office-based environments,
supplies might constitute cheques,
etc. Other industries might identify
retail stock or just-in-time supplies,
or vehicle fuels.

Supplies
7.7.1 The organization should identify and maintain an inventory of the
core supplies that support its critical activities. Strategies to provide
these may include:
•

storage of additional supplies at another location;

•

arrangements with third parties for delivery of stock at short
notice;

•

diversion of just-in-time deliveries to other locations;

•

holding of materials at warehouses or shipping sites;

•

transfer of sub-assembly operations to an alternative location
which has supplies; and

•

identification of alternative/substitute supplies.

7.7.2 Where critical activities are dependent upon specialist supplies,
the organization should identify the key suppliers and single sources of
supply. Strategies to manage continuity of supply may include:

24 • © BSI 2006

•

increasing the number of suppliers;

•

encouraging or requiring suppliers to have a validated business
continuity capability;

•

contractual and/or service level agreements with key suppliers; or

•

the identification of alternative, capable suppliers.

BS 25999-1:2006
7.8

Stakeholders

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

7.8.1 When determining appropriate BCM strategies, the organization
should consider and protect the interests of its key stakeholders. These
strategies should take into account relevant social and cultural
considerations.
7.8.2 The organization should identify appropriate strategies to
manage relationships with key stakeholders, business or service
partners and contractors. Each group might need particular
considerations. Strategies to protect the interests of key stakeholders
may include special arrangements for ensuring the welfare of
stakeholders with specific needs, such as disability, illness or
pregnancy.
7.8.3 The organization should identify a person or persons who will
discharge responsibility for welfare issues following an incident.

7.9

Civil emergencies
7.9.1 Organizations seeking to determine, implement or validate
strategies for incident management and business continuity
management should become familiar with official local responder
bodies at an early stage. These local responders are tasked with
anticipation, assessment, prevention, preparation, response and
recovery activities in relation to civil emergencies occurring within
their communities.
NOTE In the UK, these responder bodies may be known as local
resilience forums.

7.9.2 Key responders will be instrumental in officially declaring that a
civil emergency has occurred and in providing:
•

pre- or post-incident advice (e.g. risk assessments);

•

warning and informing procedures; and

•

community recovery arrangements following a civil emergency.

NOTE 1 Civil emergencies can result in death and physical injury; they
can have a profound and long term impact on the psychological, social,
and economic welfare of individuals and their communities. Emergencies
can quickly incur significant disruption to public transport services,
communication networks, critical infrastructures and the smooth flow of
goods, services and supplies. In light of this potential for disruption,
organizations may wish to familiarize themselves with the planning
arrangements of their respective local resilience forum.
NOTE 2 Under the UK Civil Contingencies Act (2004) [1], local
authorities are lawfully required to provide business continuity advice
and guidance to both commercial and voluntary organizations operating
within their jurisdiction.

7.10

Sign-off
Top management should sign off the documented strategies to confirm
that the determination of continuity strategies has been properly
undertaken and caters for likely causes and effects of disruption, and
that the chosen strategies are appropriate to meet the organization’s
objectives within the organization’s risk appetite.

8.1

Introduction
Clause 6 and Clause 7 set out how the organization should:
•

identify its critical activities;

•

evaluate threats to these critical activities;

•

choose appropriate strategies to reduce the likelihood and impacts
of incidents; and

•

choose appropriate strategies that provide for the continuity or
recovery of its critical activities.

The range of threats to be planned for should be determined by the
organization’s risk appetite.

8.2
COMMENTARY ON 8.2
In small organizations the
responsibility for incident and
business continuity management
may be vested in a single
individual. Larger organizations
may use a tiered approach and
may establish different teams to
focus on incident management,
business continuity and business
recovery issues. In some cases these
teams may be supported by other
teams with responsibility for
activities such as media
communications and people issues.

Incident response structure
8.2.1 The organization should define an incident response structure
that will enable an effective response and recovery from disruptions.
8.2.2 In any incident situation there should be a simple and
quickly-formed structure that will enable the organization to:
•

confirm the nature and extent of the incident,

•

take control of the situation,

•

contain the incident, and

•

communicate with stakeholders.

The same structure should trigger an appropriate business continuity
response. This structure may be referred to as the incident management
team (IMT) or crisis management team (CMT).

BS 25999-1:2006
8.2.3 The team should have plans, processes and procedures to
manage the incident and these should be supported by business
continuity tools to enable continuity and recovery of critical
activities.

Figure 2 illustrates the three main phases over time of an incident,
and the relationship between incident management and business
continuity.

coordination and communication of the incident response.

recovery of costs from insurers

NOTE In some cases an organization’s activation of its incident
management, business continuity and business recovery plans may be
enacted in rapid succession or simultaneously.

8.2.5 Organizations may develop specific plans to recover or resume
operations back to a “normal” state (recovery plans). However, in
some incidents it might not be possible to define what “normal” looks
like until some time after the incident, so that it might not be possible
to implement recovery plans immediately. Organizations might
therefore wish to ensure that business continuity plans are capable of
extended operation, giving time for the development of recovery
(“back-to-normal”) plans.

8.3.1
COMMENTARY ON 8.3.1
A small organization may have a
single plan that encompasses all
requirements for the business and
which covers its entire operations.
A very large organization may
have many plans, each of which
specifies in detail the recovery of:

Content of plans
Introduction
All plans, whether incident management plans, business continuity
plans or business recovery plans, should be concise and accessible to
those with responsibilities defined in the plans. Plans should contain the
elements in 8.3.2 to 8.3.6.

— a particular part of its business;
— particular premises; or
— a particular scenario,
and may include separate
documentation for the incident,
continuity and recovery phases.

8.3.2
COMMENTARY ON 8.3.2
Each plan may state clearly what it
does not intend to achieve and why.

Purpose and scope
The purpose and scope of each specific plan should be defined, agreed
by top management, and understood by those who will put the plan into
effect. Any relationship to other relevant plans or documents within the
organization should be clearly referenced and the method of obtaining
and accessing these plans described.
Each incident management, business continuity and business recovery
plan should set out prioritized objectives in terms of:

8.3.3
COMMENTARY ON 8.3.3
Plans may also contain, where
appropriate, procedures and
checklists that support the postincident review process.

28 • © BSI 2006

•

the critical activities to be recovered;

•

the timescales in which they are to be recovered;

•

the recovery levels needed for each critical activity; and

•

the situation in which each plan can be utilized.

Roles and responsibilities
The roles and responsibility of the people and teams having authority
(both in terms of decision-making and authority to spend) during and
following an incident should be clearly documented.
The persons or groups covered by a plan should be clearly defined.

8.3.4
COMMENTARY ON 8.3.4
Time lost during a response can
never be regained. It is almost
always better to mobilize the
response team and subsequently
stand it down than to miss an
opportunity to contain an incident
early and prevent escalation.
Organizations may factor in
defined and internationally agreed
escalation stages in line with clear
guidance from other expert
sources, e.g. the World Health
Organization for pandemics.

Plan invocation
The method by which an incident management, business continuity or
business recovery plan is invoked should be clearly documented. This
process should allow for the relevant plans or parts thereof to be
invoked in the shortest possible time following the occurrence of a
business disruption.
The organization should establish and document clear guidelines and a
set of criteria regarding which individual(s) have the authority to invoke
the plan(s) and under what circumstances.
The invocation process may require the immediate mobilization of
organizational resources. The plan should include a clear and precise
description of:
•

how to mobilize the team(s);

•

immediate rendezvous points; and

•

subsequent team meeting locations and details of any alternative
meeting locations (in larger organizations, these meeting places
may be referred to as incident management or command centres).

The organization should document a clear process for standing down
the team(s) once the incident is over, and returning to business as usual.

8.3.5

Document owner and maintainer
The organization should nominate the primary owner of the plan, and
identify and document who is responsible for reviewing, amending and
updating the plan at regular intervals.
A system of version control should be employed, and changes formally
notified to all interested parties with a formal plan distribution record
maintained and kept up-to-date.

8.3.6
COMMENTARY ON 8.3.6
The contact records may include
“out of hours” contact details.
However, where plans reference
such private details, respect for
data protection has to be a
paramount consideration.

8.4

Contact details
Each plan should contain or provide a reference to the essential contact
details for all key stakeholders.

The incident management plan (IMP)
The purpose of an IMP is to allow the organization to manage the initial
(acute) phase of an incident.
The IMP should:
a) be flexible, feasible, and relevant;
b) be easy to read and understand; and
c)

provide the basis for managing all possible issues, including the
stakeholder and external issues, facing the organization during an
incident.

© BSI 2006 •

29

BS 25999-1:2006
The IMP should also:
1) have top management support, including a board sponsor
where applicable; and
2) be supported by an appropriate budget for development,
maintenance and training.

8.5.1

Contents of the IMP
General
In addition to the content recommended in 8.3, an IMP should include
the information in 8.5.2 to 8.5.8.

8.5.2

Task and action lists
The IMP should include task lists and action checklists to manage the
immediate consequences of a business disruption. These tasks should:

8.5.3
COMMENTARY ON 8.5.3
Depending upon the scale of the
organization and the size of the
incident, a number of competent,
trained people may be required to
respond to telephone enquiries
about the incident.

8.5.4
COMMENTARY ON 8.5.4
Organizations have a direct
responsibility to safeguard the
welfare of employees, contractors,
visitors and customers where an
incident poses a direct risk to life,
livelihood and welfare. Special
attention will need to be paid to
any groups with disabilities or
other specific needs (e.g.
pregnancy, temporary disability
due to injury, etc.). Planning in
advance to meet these
requirements can reduce risk and
reassure those affected.
The long-term impacts of incidents
cannot be underestimated.
Developing appropriate strategies
in support of human welfare can
directly promote physical and
emotional recovery within the
organization.

30 • © BSI 2006

•

ensure that safety of individuals is addressed first;

•

be based upon the results of the organization’s BIA;

•

be structured in a way that delivers the strategic and tactical
options chosen by the organization (as described in Clause 7); and

•

help prevent the further loss or unavailability of critical activities,
and supporting resources as defined in Clause 7.

Emergency contacts
A description of how, and under what circumstances, the organization
will communicate with staff and their relatives, friends and emergency
contacts should be included. In some cases, it might be appropriate to
include detail in a separate document.
Next-of-kin and emergency contact information for all personnel should
be kept up-to-date and available for prompt use.

People activities
The IMP should satisfy the interests of those whose welfare might be put
at risk as a result of an incident, taking into account relevant social and
cultural considerations (see 7.8.2).
The IMP should identify the person(s), who will discharge responsibility
for welfare issues following an incident (see 7.8.3), including:
a) site evacuation (inclusive of internal “shelter-at-site” activities);
b) the mobilization of safety, first aid or evacuation-assistance teams;
c) locating and accounting for those who were on site or in the
immediate vicinity;
d) ongoing employee/customer communications and safety briefings.
The organization should deploy staff with appropriate levels of authority
to liaise where appropriate with the emergency services.
NOTE Emergency services play the primary role in protecting life and
relieving suffering during emergencies. Therefore, early liaison,
pre-planning and real-time incident coordination between the
organization and its first responders and the emergency services can
improve the efficiency of an incident response.

BS 25999-1:2006
The organization may retain a means to provide services to debrief and
counsel affected staff after an incident. Services may be sourced
externally or may be provided as an extension to existing occupational
health and employee assistance programmes.

8.5.5
COMMENTARY ON 8.5.5
Pre-prepared information can be
especially useful in the early stages
of an incident. It enables an
organization to provide details
about the organization and its
business while details of the
incident are still being established.
An organization may use all
applicable means to share
information during and after an
incident. Such sources may include
websites, spokespeople, news
sources, and generic company
briefing statements.

8.5.6
COMMENTARY ON 8.5.6
Pressure or community action
groups who collectively have power
or influence over the organization
might also need to be considered.

Media response
The organization’s media response should be documented in the IMP,
including:
a) the incident communications strategy;
b) the organization’s preferred interface with the media;
c)

a guideline or template for the drafting of a statement to be
provided to the media at the earliest practicable opportunity
following the incident;

d) appropriate numbers of trained, competent, spokespeople
nominated and authorized to release information to the media;
e)

establishment, where practicable, of a suitable venue to support
liaison with the media, or other stakeholder groups.

In some cases, it may be appropriate to:
•

provide supporting detail in a separate document;

•

establish an appropriate number of competent, trained people to
answer telephone enquiries from the press;

•

prepare background material about the organization and its
operations (this information should be pre-agreed for release);

•

ensure that all media information is made available without undue
delay.

Stakeholder management
A process for identifying and prioritizing communications with other
key stakeholders should be included. It may be necessary to develop a
separate stakeholder management plan to provide criteria for setting
priorities and allocating a person to each stakeholder or group of
stakeholders.

8.5.7
COMMENTARY ON 8.5.7
An incident management location
provides a known focal point from
which the incident can be
managed. It is important to
capture and share key information
and to set objectives, assign tasks,
manage resources, identify and
track issues, and make informed
decisions. Good communications
are essential. The use of a meeting
point overcomes the situations
where telephone networks are
overloaded.

Incident management location
The organization should define a robust and predetermined location,
room or space from which an incident will be managed. Once
established, this location should be the focal point for the organization’s
response. An alternative meeting point at a different location should
also be nominated in case access to the primary location is denied. Each
location should have access to appropriate resources by which the
incident team may initiate effective incident management activities
without delay.
The chosen location should be fit-for-purpose and include:
a) effective primary and secondary means of communication;
b) facilities for accessing and sharing information, including the
monitoring of the news media.

The location may be as simple as a
hotel room or a staff member’s
house. It may be as complex as a
dedicated “command centre” with
PCs, video-conferencing and
multiple telephones.
Initially, it might be necessary to
hold a virtual or off-site meeting,
e.g. via telephone, teleconference or
videoconference, so that key
decisions can be made promptly.

8.5.8

Annexes
The IMP should include up-to-date contact and mobilization details for
any relevant agencies, organizations and resources that might be
required to support the organization’s response strategies.
The IMP should include logs or forms for the recording of vital
information about the incident, such as the incident timeline, details of
casualties, decisions made, money spent, details of casualties, damage
assessments, communications issued, and all other information deemed
essential by the organization to support post incident review.
The IMP may also include or reference:
a) maps, charts, plans, photographs and other information that might
be relevant in the event of an incident;
b) documented response strategies agreed with third parties as
appropriate (joint venture partners, contractors, suppliers, etc.);
c) details of equipment storage and staging areas;
d) site access plans; and
e) a claims management procedure that ensures all insurance and
legal claims for or against the organization meet regulatory and
contractual requirements.

COMMENTARY ON 8.6
The components and contents of
BCPs vary from organization to
organization and have a different
level of detail based on the scale,
environment, culture and technical
complexity of the organization.

The business continuity plan(s) [BCP(s)]
The purpose of a business continuity plan (BCP) is to enable an
organization to recover or maintain its activities in the event of a
disruption to normal business operations.
BCPs are activated (invoked) to support the critical activities required
to deliver the organization's objectives. They may be invoked in whole
or part and at any stage of the response to an incident.

Large organizations might require
separate documents for each of
their critical activities, whereas
smaller organizations might be
able to cover everything that is
critical to them within a single
document.

8.7
8.7.1

Contents of the BCP
General
In addition to the items recommended in 8.3, a BCP should contain the
elements in 8.7.2 to 8.7.5.

8.7.2
COMMENTARY ON 8.7.2
These points are consistent with the
requirements of the Civil
Contingencies Act [1], Section 6.20.
Plans will reference the people,
premises, technology, information,
supplies and stakeholders
identified in the strategies phase
(see Clause 7). Clear assumptions
and details of any resources
required to implement plans ought
to be included. In the event that the
lack of a service or resource makes
the plan’s goals unachievable, a
clear procedure for escalating the
issue ought to be defined.

Action plans/ task lists
The action plan should include a structured checklist of actions and
tasks in an order of priority, highlighting:
a) how the BCP is invoked;
b) the person(s) responsible for invoking the business continuity
plan;
c)

the procedure that person should adopt in taking that decision;

d) the person(s) who should be consulted before such a decision is
taken;
e)

the person(s) who should be informed once a decision has been
taken;

f)

who goes where, and when;

g) what services are available where, and when; including how the
organization mobilizes external and third-party resources;
h) how and when this information is communicated; and
i)

if relevant, detailed procedures for manual workarounds, system
recovery, etc.

management of, and communication with, stakeholders.

Responsible person(s)
The organization should identify a nominated person(s) to manage the
business continuity and business recovery phases of a disruption.

Forms and annexes
Where appropriate, the BCP should contain up-to-date contact details
for relevant internal and external agencies, organizations and providers
that might be required to support the organization.
The business continuity plan should include an incident log or forms for
the recording of vital information, especially in respect of decisions
made.

9.1

Introduction
An organization’s business continuity and incident management
arrangements cannot be considered reliable until exercised and unless
their currency is maintained. Exercising is essential to developing
teamwork, competence, confidence and knowledge which is vital at the
time of an incident.
Arrangements should be verified through exercising, audit and
self-assessment processes to ensure that they are fit-for-purpose.

9.2
COMMENTARY ON 9.2
Exercises provide demonstrable
evidence of a business continuity
and incident management
competence and capability. Time
and resources spent proving BCM
strategies by exercising BCPs will
lead to a fit-for-purpose capability.
No matter how well designed and
thought-out a BCM strategy or BCP
appears to be, a series of robust
and realistic exercises will identify
areas that require amendment.

Exercise programme
An exercise programme should be consistent with the scope of the
business continuity plan(s), giving due regard to any relevant legislation
and regulation. Exercises may:
•

anticipate a predetermined outcome, e.g. are planned and scoped
in advance; or

•

allow the organization to develop innovative solutions.

An exercise programme should be devised that, over a period of time,
leads to objective assurance that the BCP will work as anticipated when
required. The programme should:
•

exercise the technical, logistical, administrative, procedural and
other operational systems of the BCP;

•

exercise the BCM arrangements and infrastructure (including
roles, responsibilities, and any incident management locations and
work areas, etc.);

•

validate the technology and telecommunications recovery,
including the availability and relocation of staff.

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

In addition, it might lead to the improvement of BCM capability by:

9.3

•

practising the organization’s ability to recover from an incident;

•

verifying that the BCP incorporates all organizational critical
activities and their dependencies and priorities;

•

highlighting assumptions which need to be questioned;

•

instilling confidence amongst exercise participants;

•

raising awareness of business continuity throughout the
organization by publicizing the exercise;

•

validating the effectiveness and timeliness of restoration of critical
activities; and

•

demonstrating competence of the primary response teams and
their alternatives.

Exercising BCM arrangements
9.3.1 Exercises should be realistic, carefully planned, and agreed with
stakeholders, so that there is minimum risk of disruption to business
processes. An exercise should be planned such that the risk of an
incident occurring as a direct result of the exercise is minimized.
9.3.2 Every exercise should have clearly defined aims and objectives. A
post-exercise debriefing and analysis should be undertaken which
considers the achievement of the aims and objectives of the exercise. A
post-exercise report should be produced that contains
recommendations and a timetable for their implementation.
9.3.3 The scale and complexity of exercises should be appropriate to
the organization’s recovery objectives.

COMMENTARY ON 9.3.4
Exercises that show serious
deficiencies or inaccuracies in the
BCP ought to be rerun after
corrective actions have been
completed.
A range of approaches to
exercising BCM strategies is shown
in Table 1.

9.3.4 Business continuity and incident management plans should be
exercised to ensure that they can be executed correctly, and contain
appropriate detail and instructions.

The frequency of exercises should depend upon both the organization’s needs, the environment in which it operates,
and stakeholder requirements. However, the exercising programme should be flexible, taking into account the rate of
change within the organization and the outcome of previous exercises. The above exercise methods can be employed
for individual plan components, and single and multiple plans.

9.3.5 The exercise programme should consider the roles of all parties,
including key third party providers, outsource partners and others who
would be expected to participate in recovery activities. An organization
may include such parties in its exercises.

9.4
COMMENTARY ON 9.4
The purpose of the BCM
maintenance process is to ensure
that the organization’s BCM
competence and capability
remains effective, fit-for purpose
and up-to-date.
Maintenance activities ought to
modify existing exercise schedules
when they indicate that there has
been a significant change in the
strategy, solution or business
process.

Maintaining BCM arrangements
A clearly defined and documented BCM maintenance programme
should be established. This programme should ensure that any changes
(internal or external) that impact the organization are reviewed in
relation to BCM. It should also identify any new products and services
and their dependent activities that need to be included in the BCM
maintenance programme.
As a result of the BCM maintenance programme, the organization
should:
•

review and challenge any assumptions made in any components of
BCM throughout the organization; and

•

distribute updated, amended or changed BCM policy, strategies,
solutions, processes and plans to key personnel under a formal
change control process.

NOTE If there are major business changes then a revision of the BIA
ought to be undertaken. The other components of the BCM programme may
be amended to take account of these changes.

The outcomes from the BCM maintenance process should include:
•

documented evidence of the proactive management and
governance of the organization’s business continuity programme;

•

verification that key people who are to implement the BCM
strategy and plans are trained and competent;

9.5

•

verification of the monitoring and control of the BCM risks faced
by the organization; and

•

documented evidence that material changes to the organization’s
structure, products and services, activities, purpose, staff and
objectives have been incorporated into the organization’s business
continuity and incident management plans.

Reviewing BCM arrangements
9.5.1 The organization’s top management should, at intervals that it
deems appropriate, review the organization’s BCM capability, to
ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. This
review should be documented.
9.5.2 The review should verify that compliance with the organization’s
BCM policy ensures compliance with any applicable laws, standards,
strategies, frameworks and good practice guidelines.

COMMENTARY ON 9.5.3
In the context of continual
improvement, the organization
may acquire knowledge on new
BCM-related technology and
practices, including new tools and
techniques, and these have to be
evaluated to establish their
potential benefit to the
organization.

9.5.3 The review should address the possible need for changes to
policy, strategy, objectives and other elements of the BCM
management system in the light of such things as exercise results,
changing circumstances and the commitment to continual
improvement.
9.5.4 The review can take the form of internal or external audits, or
self-assessments. The frequency and timing of reviews can be
influenced by laws and regulations, depending on the size, nature and
legal status of the organization. They might also be influenced by the
requirements of stakeholders.
An audit or self-assessment of the organization’s BCM programme
should verify that:

38 • © BSI 2006

•

all key products and services and their supporting critical activities
and resources have been identified and included in the
organization’s BCM strategy;

•

the organization’s BCM policy, strategies, framework and plans
accurately reflect its priorities and requirements (the
organization’s objectives);

•

the organization’s BCM competence and its BCM capability are
effective and fit-for-purpose and will permit management,
command, control and coordination of an incident;

•

the organization’s BCM solutions are effective, up-to-date and
fit-for-purpose, and appropriate to the level of risk faced by the
organization;

•

the organization’s BCM maintenance and exercising programmes
have been effectively implemented;

•

BCM strategies and plans incorporate improvements identified
during incidents and exercises and in the maintenance
programme;

•

the organization has an ongoing programme for BCM training and
awareness;

•

BCM procedures have been effectively communicated to relevant
staff, and that those staff understand their roles and
responsibilities; and

•

change control processes are in place and operate effectively.

BS 25999-1:2006
9.5.5

Audit

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

The organization should provide for the independent audit of its
BCM competence and capability to identify actual and potential
shortcomings. It should establish, implement and maintain procedures
for dealing with these. Independent audits should be conducted by
competent persons, whether internal or external.

9.5.6

Self-assessment
A BCM self-assessment process plays a role in ensuring that
an organization has a robust, effective and fit-for-purpose
BCM competence and capability. It provides the qualitative
verification of an organization’s ability to recover from an
incident. Self-assessment should be conducted against the

To be successful, business continuity has to become part of
the way that an organization is managed, regardless of size or
sector. At each stage of the BCM process, opportunities exist
to introduce and enhance an organization’s BCM culture.

10.1

General

COMMENTARY ON 10.1
Creating and embedding a BCM
culture within an organization can
be a lengthy and difficult process
which might encounter a level of
resistance that was not
anticipated. An understanding of
the existing culture within the
organization will assist in the
development of an appropriate
BCM culture programme.

Building, promoting and embedding a BCM culture within an
organization ensures that it becomes part of the organization’s core
values and effective management.

All staff have to understand that
BCM is a serious issue for the
organization and that they have an
important role to play in
maintaining the delivery of
products and services to their
clients and customers.

10.2
COMMENTARY ON 10.2
Raising and maintaining
awareness of BCM with all the
organization’s staff is important to
ensure that they are aware of why
BCM is important to the
organization. They will need to be
shown that this is a lasting
initiative that has the ongoing
support of top management.

An organization with a positive BCM culture will:
•

develop a BCM programme more efficiently;

•

instil confidence in its stakeholders (especially staff and
customers) in its ability to handle business disruptions;

•

increase its resilience over time by ensuring BCM implications are
considered in decisions at all levels; and

•

minimize the likelihood and impact of disruptions.

Development of a BCM culture is supported by:
•

leadership from senior personnel in the organization;

•

assignment of responsibilities (see 5.2);

•

awareness raising;

•

skills training; and

•

exercising plans.

Awareness
The organization should have a process for identifying and delivering
the BCM awareness requirements of the organization and evaluating the
effectiveness of its delivery.
BCM staff should make themselves aware of external BCM information.
This may be done in conjunction with seeking guidance from emergency
services, local authorities and regulators.

BS 25999-1:2006
The organization should raise, enhance and maintain awareness by
maintaining an ongoing BCM education and information programme for
all staff.

Such a programme may include:
•

a consultation process with staff throughout the organization
concerning the implementation of the BCM programme;

•

discussion of BCM in the organization’s newsletters, briefings,
induction programme or journals;

•

inclusion of BCM on relevant web pages or intranets;

•

learning from internal and external incidents;

•

BCM as an item at team meetings;

•

exercising continuity plans at an alternative location (e.g. a
recovery site); and

•

visits to any designated alternative location (e.g. a recovery site).

The organization may extend its BCM awareness programme to its
suppliers and other stakeholders.

10.3

Skills training
The organization should have a process for identifying and delivering
the BCM training requirements of relevant participants and evaluating
the effectiveness of its delivery.
The organization should undertake training of:
a) BCM staff for tasks such as:
•

BCM programme management,

•

conducting a business impact analysis,

•

developing and implementing BCPs,

•

running a BCP exercise programme,

•

risk and threat assessment, and

•

media communications;

b) non-BCM staff requiring skills to undertake their nominated roles
in incident response or business recovery.
Response skills and competence throughout the organization should be
developed by practical training, including active participation in
exercises.
