BS 25999-2:2007

Foreword
This British Standard was published by BSI and came into effect
on 20 November 2007. It was prepared by Panel BCM/1/-/2, under the
authority of Technical Committee BCM/1, Business continuity
management. A list of organizations represented on this committee
can be obtained on request to its secretary.
This British Standard has been developed by practitioners throughout
the business continuity community, drawing upon their academic,
technical and practical experiences of business continuity management
(BCM). It has been produced to define requirements for a management
systems approach to business continuity management based on good
practice for use in large, medium and small organizations operating in
industrial, commercial, public and voluntary sectors.
BS 25999, Business continuity management, is published in two
parts:
– Part 1: Code of practice;
– Part 2: Specification.
The requirements specified in this British Standard have been
developed with due regard for the principles and practices contained
within BS25999-1.
This British Standard provides a specification for use by internal and
external parties, including certification bodies, to assess the
organization’s ability to meet regulatory, customer, and the
organization’s own requirements.
This British Standard contains only those requirements that can be
objectively audited. Those organizations requiring more general
guidance on a broad range of business continuity management issues
are referred to BS 25999-1.
Demonstration of successful implementation of this British Standard
can therefore be used by an organization to assure interested parties
that an appropriate business continuity management system is in place.
In common with modern management system standards this standard
utilizes the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle for developing,
implementing, and improving the effectiveness of an organization’s
business continuity management system.
This publication does not purport to include all the necessary provisions
of a contract.
Users are responsible for its correct application.
Compliance with a British Standard cannot confer immunity
from legal obligations.

BS 25999-2:2007

Introduction
General
This British Standard specifies requirements for setting up and
managing an effective business continuity management system
(BCMS).
This emphasizes the importance of:
a) understanding business continuity needs and the necessity for
establishing policy and objectives for business continuity;
b) implementing and operating controls and measures for managing
an organization’s overall business continuity risks;
c)

monitoring and reviewing the performance and effectiveness of
the BCMS; and

d) continual improvement based on objective measurement.
A BCMS, like any other management system, has the following key
components:
a) a policy;
b) people with defined responsibilities;
c)

management processes relating to:
1) policy;
2) planning;
3) implementation and operation;
4) performance assessment;
5) management review; and
6) improvement;

d) a set of documentation providing auditable evidence; and
e)

topic specific processes relating to the subject, in this case
business continuity, such as business impact analysis (BIA) and
business continuity plan development.

The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle
The standard applies the “Plan-Do-Check-Act” (PDCA) cycle to
establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, exercising,
maintaining and improving the effectiveness of an organization’s BCMS.
This ensures a degree of consistency with other management systems
standards, such as BS EN ISO 9001:2000 (Quality Management
Systems), BS EN ISO 14001:2004 (Environmental
Management Systems), BS ISO/IEC 27001:2005 (Information
Security Management Systems) and BS ISO/IEC 20000:2005
(IT Service Management), thereby supporting consistent and
integrated implementation and operation with related management
systems (see Annex A).

BS 25999-2:2007
Figure 1 illustrates how a BCMS takes as inputs the business continuity
requirements and expectations of the interested parties and, through
the necessary actions and processes, produces business continuity
outcomes (i.e. managed business continuity) that meet those
requirements and expectations.

BS 25999-2:2007
A widely accepted approach that incorporates the PDCA cycle within
each activity is recommended in BS 25999-1 and summarized within
Figure 2. This iterative process ensures that business continuity is
established and continuously managed in an organization (for an
explanation of each element of the business continuity management
cycle, see BS 25999-1:2006, 3.7).

BS 25999-2:2007

1 Scope
This British Standard specifies requirements for planning, establishing,
implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, exercising,
maintaining and improving a documented BCMS within the context of
managing an organization’s overall business risks.
The requirements specified in this British Standard are generic and
intended to be applicable to all organizations (or parts thereof),
regardless of type, size and nature of business. The extent of application
of these requirements depends on the organization’s operating
environment and complexity.
It is not the intent of this British Standard to imply uniformity in the
structure of a BCMS but for an organization to design a BCMS that is
appropriate to its needs and that meets its stakeholders’ requirements.
These needs are shaped by regulatory, customer and business
requirements, the products and services, the processes employed, the
size and structure of the organization and the requirements of its
stakeholders.
This British Standard can be used by internal and external parties,
including certification bodies, to assess an organization’s ability to meet
its own business continuity needs, as well as any customer, legal or
regulatory needs.

2 Terms and definitions
For the purposes of this part of BS 25999, the following definitions
apply.

2.1

activity

behalf) that produces or supports one or more products or services
NOTE Examples of such processes include accounts, call centre, IT,
manufacture, distribution.

2.2

audit
systematic examination to determine whether activities and related
results conform to planned arrangements and whether these
arrangements are implemented effectively and are suitable for achieving
the organization’s policy and objectives
[BS EN ISO 9000:2005]

2.3

business continuity
strategic and tactical capability of the organization to plan for and
respond to incidents and business disruptions in order to continue

BS 25999-2:2007
2.4

business continuity management (BCM)
holistic management process that identifies potential threats to an
organization and the impacts to business operations that those threats,
if realized, might cause, and which provides a framework for building
organizational resilience with the capability for an effective response
that safeguards the interests of its key stakeholders, reputation, brand
and value-creating activities
NOTE Business continuity management involves managing the
recovery or continuation of business activities in the event of a business
disruption, and management of the overall programme through training,
exercises and reviews, to ensure the business continuity plan(s) stays
current and up-to-date.

2.5

business continuity management lifecycle

aspects and phases of the business continuity management
programme
NOTE The business continuity management lifecycle is illustrated in
Figure 2.

2.6

2.7

business continuity management personnel

those assigned responsibilities defined in the BCMS, those accountable
for BCM policy and its implementation, those who implement and
maintain the BCMS, those who use or invoke the business continuity
and incident management plans, and those with authority during an
incident

business continuity management programme
ongoing management and governance process supported by top
management and appropriately resourced to ensure that the necessary
steps are taken to identify the impact of potential losses, maintain viable
recovery strategies and plans, and ensure continuity of products and
services through training, exercising, maintenance and review

2.8

business continuity management response
element of BCM concerned with the development and implementation
of appropriate plans and arrangements to ensure continuity of critical
activities, and the management of an incident

2.9

business continuity management system (BCMS)
that part of the overall management system that establishes,
implements, operates, monitors, reviews, maintains and improves
business continuity
NOTE The management system includes organizational structure,
policies, planning activities, responsibilities, procedures, processes and
resources.

2.10

business continuity plan (BCP)
documented collection of procedures and information that is developed,
compiled and maintained in readiness for use in an incident to enable
an organization to continue to deliver its critical activities at an
acceptable predefined level

process of analysing business functions and the effect that a business
disruption might have upon them

2.13

consequence
outcome of an incident that will have an impact on an organization’s
objectives
NOTE 1

There can be a range of consequences from one incident.

NOTE 2 A consequence can be certain or uncertain and can have positive
or negative impact on objectives.

2.14

cost-benefit analysis
financial technique that measures the cost of implementing a particular
solution and compares this with the benefit delivered by that solution
NOTE The benefit may be defined in financial, reputational, service
delivery, regulatory or other terms appropriate to the organization.

2.15

critical activities
those activities which have to be performed in order to deliver the key
products and services which enable an organization to meet its most
important and time-sensitive objectives

2.16

disruption

unanticipated (e.g. a blackout or earthquake), which causes an
unplanned, negative deviation from the expected delivery of products or
services according to the organization’s objectives

2.17

exercise
activity in which the business continuity plan(s) is rehearsed in part or
in whole to ensure that the plan(s) contains the appropriate information
and produces the desired result when put into effect
NOTE An exercise can involve invoking business continuity procedures,
but is more likely to involve the simulation of a business continuity
incident, announced or unannounced, in which participants role-play in
order to assess what issues might arise, prior to a real invocation.

2.18

2.22

internal audit
audit conducted by, or on behalf of, the organization itself for
management review and other internal purposes, and which might form
the basis for an organization’s self-declaration of conformity
NOTE In many cases, particularly in smaller organizations,
independence can be demonstrated by the freedom from responsibility for
the activity being audited.

2.23

invocation
act of declaring that an organization’s business continuity plan needs to
be put into effect in order to continue delivery of key products or
services

2.24

likelihood

chance of something happening, whether defined, measured or
estimated objectively or subjectively, or in terms of general descriptors
(such as rare, unlikely, likely, almost certain), frequencies or
mathematical probabilities
NOTE 1 Likelihood can be expressed qualitatively or quantitatively.
NOTE 2 The word “probability” can be used instead of “likelihood” in
some non-English languages that have no direct equivalent. Because
“probability” is often interpreted more formally in English as a
mathematical term, “likelihood” is used throughout this Standard with the
intention that it is given the same broad interpretation as “probability”.

2.25

loss
negative consequence

2.26

management system
system to establish policy and objectives and to achieve those
objectives
[BS EN ISO 9000:2005]

2.27

2.30

process
set of interrelated or interacting activities which transforms inputs into
outputs
[BS EN ISO 9000:2005]

2.31

products and services
beneficial outcomes provided by an organization to its customers,
recipients and stakeholders, e.g. manufactured items, car insurance,
regulatory compliance and community nursing

2.32

recovery time objective
target time set for resumption of product, service or activity delivery
after an incident
NOTE The recovery time objective has to be less than the maximum
tolerable period of disruption.

2.33

resilience
ability of an organization to resist being affected by an incident

2.34

resources
all assets, people, skills, information, technology (including plant and
equipment), premises, and supplies and information (whether
electronic or not) that an organization has to have available to use, when
needed, in order to operate and meet its objectives

2.35

risk
something that might happen and its effect(s) on the achievement of
objectives
NOTE 1 The word “risk” is used colloquially in various ways, as a noun
(“a risk” or, in the plural, “risks”), a verb (to risk [something], or to put at
risk), or as an adjective (“risky”). Used as a noun the term “a risk” could
relate to either a potential event, its causes, the chance (likelihood) of
something happening, or the effects of such events. In risk management it
is important to make a clear distinction between these various usages of
the word “risk”.
NOTE 2 Risk is defined relative to a particular objective; therefore,
concern for several objectives implies the possibility of more than one
measure of risk with respect to any source of risk.
NOTE 3 Risk is often quantified as an average effect by summing the
combined effect of each possible consequence weighted by the associated
likelihood of each consequence, to obtain an “expected value”. However,
probability distributions are needed to quantify perceptions about the
range of possible consequences. Alternatively, summary statistics, such as
standard deviation, may be used in addition to expected value.

2.36

risk assessment
overall process of risk identification, analysis and evaluation

2.37

risk management
structured development and application of management culture, policy,
procedures and practices to the tasks of identifying, analysing,
evaluating, and controlling responding to risk

2.38

stakeholders
those with a vested interest in an organization’s achievements
NOTE This is a wide-ranging term that includes, but is not limited to,
internal and “outsourced” employees, customers, suppliers, partners,
employees, distributors, investors, insurers, shareholders, owners,
government and regulators.

2.39

system
set of interrelated or interacting elements
[BS EN ISO 9000:2005]

2.40

top management
person or group of people who direct and control an organization at the
highest level [BS EN ISO 9000:2005]
NOTE Top management, especially in a large multinational
organization, might not be directly involved; however, top management
accountability through the chain of command is manifest. In a small
organization, top management might be the owner or sole proprietor.
