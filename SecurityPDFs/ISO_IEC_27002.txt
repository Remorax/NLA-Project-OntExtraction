Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27002 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.
This first edition of ISO/IEC 27002 comprises ISO/IEC 17799:2005 and ISO/IEC 17799:2005/Cor.1:2007. Its
technical content is identical to that of ISO/IEC 17799:2005. ISO/IEC 17799:2005/Cor.1:2007 changes the
reference
number
of
the
standard
from
17799
to
27002.
ISO/IEC 17799:2005
and
ISO/IEC 17799:2005/Cor.1:2007 are provisionally retained until publication of the second edition of
ISO/IEC 27002.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives,
Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft
International Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of

ISO/IEC 17799 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.
This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO/IEC 17799:2000), which has been
technically revised.
A family of Information Security Management System (ISMS) International Standards is being
developed within ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27. The family includes International Standards on information
security management system requirements, risk management, metrics and measurement, and
implementation guidance. This family will adopt a numbering scheme using the series of numbers
27000 et seq.
From 2007, it is proposed to incorporate the new edition of ISO/IEC 17799 into this new numbering
scheme as ISO/IEC 27002.

Introduction

0.1

What is information security?

Information is an asset that, like other important business assets, is essential to an organization’s
business and consequently needs to be suitably protected. This is especially important in the
increasingly interconnected business environment. As a result of this increasing interconnectivity,
information is now exposed to a growing number and a wider variety of threats and vulnerabilities
(see also OECD Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks).
Information can exist in many forms. It can be printed or written on paper, stored electronically,
transmitted by post or by using electronic means, shown on films, or spoken in conversation.
Whatever form the information takes, or means by which it is shared or stored, it should always be
appropriately protected.
Information security is the protection of information from a wide range of threats in order to ensure
business continuity, minimize business risk, and maximize return on investments and business
opportunities.
Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, including policies,
processes, procedures, organizational structures and software and hardware functions. These controls
need to be established, implemented, monitored, reviewed and improved, where necessary, to ensure
that the specific security and business objectives of the organization are met. This should be done in
conjunction with other business management processes.

0.2

Why information security is needed?

Information and the supporting processes, systems, and networks are important business assets.
Defining, achieving, maintaining, and improving information security may be essential to maintain
competitive edge, cash flow, profitability, legal compliance, and commercial image.
Organizations and their information systems and networks are faced with security threats from a wide
range of sources, including computer-assisted fraud, espionage, sabotage, vandalism, fire or flood.
Causes of damage such as malicious code, computer hacking, and denial of service attacks have
become more common, more ambitious, and increasingly sophisticated.
Information security is important to both public and private sector businesses, and to protect critical
infrastructures. In both sectors, information security will function as an enabler, e.g. to achieve egovernment or e-business, and to avoid or reduce relevant risks. The interconnection of public and
private networks and the sharing of information resources increase the difficulty of achieving access
control. The trend to distributed computing has also weakened the effectiveness of central, specialist
control.
Many information systems have not been designed to be secure. The security that can be achieved
through technical means is limited, and should be supported by appropriate management and
procedures. Identifying which controls should be in place requires careful planning and attention to
detail. Information security management requires, as a minimum, participation by all employees in the
organization. It may also require participation from shareholders, suppliers, third parties, customers or
other external parties. Specialist advice from outside organizations may also be needed.

0.3

How to establish security requirements

It is essential that an organization identifies its security requirements. There are three main sources of
security requirements.
1. One source is derived from assessing risks to the organization, taking into account the
organization’s overall business strategy and objectives. Through a risk assessment, threats to
assets are identified, vulnerability to and likelihood of occurrence is evaluated and potential
impact is estimated.
2. Another source is the legal, statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements that an
organization, its trading partners, contractors, and service providers have to satisfy, and their
socio-cultural environment.
3. A further source is the particular set of principles, objectives and business requirements for

information processing that an organization has developed to support its operations.

0.4

Assessing security risks

Security requirements are identified by a methodical assessment of security risks. Expenditure on
controls needs to be balanced against the business harm likely to result from security failures.
The results of the risk assessment will help to guide and determine the appropriate management action
and priorities for managing information security risks, and for implementing controls selected to
protect against these risks.
Risk assessment should be repeated periodically to address any changes that might influence the risk
assessment results.
More information about the assessment of security risks can be found in clause 4.1 “Assessing
security risks”.

0.5

Selecting controls

Once security requirements and risks have been identified and decisions for the treatment of risks
have been made, appropriate controls should be selected and implemented to ensure risks are reduced
to an acceptable level. Controls can be selected from this standard or from other control sets, or new
controls can be designed to meet specific needs as appropriate. The selection of security controls is
dependent upon organizational decisions based on the criteria for risk acceptance, risk treatment
options, and the general risk management approach applied to the organization, and should also be
subject to all relevant national and international legislation and regulations.
Some of the controls in this standard can be considered as guiding principles for information security
management and applicable for most organizations. They are explained in more detail below under the
heading “Information security starting point”.
More information about selecting controls and other risk treatment options can be found in clause 4.2
"Treating security risks".

0.6

Information security starting point

A number of controls can be considered as a good starting point for implementing information
security. They are either based on essential legislative requirements or considered to be common
practice for information security.

ix

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)

Controls considered to be essential to an organization from a legislative point of view include,
depending on applicable legislation:
a)

data protection and privacy of personal information (see 15.1.4);

b)

protection of organizational records (see 15.1.3);

c)

intellectual property rights (see 15.1.2).

Controls considered to be common practice for information security include:
a)

information security policy document (see 5.1.1);

b)

allocation of information security responsibilities (see 6.1.3);

c)

information security awareness, education, and training (see 8.2.2);

d)

correct processing in applications (see 12.2);

e)

technical vulnerability management (see 12.6);

f)

business continuity management (see 14);

g)

management of information security incidents and improvements (see 13.2).

These controls apply to most organizations and in most environments.
It should be noted that although all controls in this standard are important and should be considered,
the relevance of any control should be determined in the light of the specific risks an organization is
facing. Hence, although the above approach is considered a good starting point, it does not replace
selection of controls based on a risk assessment.

0.7

Critical success factors

Experience has shown that the following factors are often critical to the successful implementation of
information security within an organization:

1

a)

information security policy, objectives, and activities that reflect business objectives;

b)

an approach and framework to implementing, maintaining, monitoring, and improving
information security that is consistent with the organizational culture;

c)

visible support and commitment from all levels of management;

d)

a good understanding of the information security requirements, risk assessment, and risk
management;

e)

effective marketing of information security to all managers, employees, and other parties to
achieve awareness;

f)

distribution of guidance on information security policy and standards to all managers,
employees and other parties;

g)

provision to fund information security management activities;

h)

providing appropriate awareness, training, and education;

i)

establishing an effective information security incident management process;

j)

implementation of a measurement 1 system that is used to evaluate performance in
information security management and feedback suggestions for improvement.

Note that information security measurements are outside of the scope of this standard.

Developing your own guidelines

This code of practice may be regarded as a starting point for developing organization specific
guidelines. Not all of the controls and guidance in this code of practice may be applicable.
Furthermore, additional controls and guidelines not included in this standard may be required. When
documents are developed containing additional guidelines or controls, it may be useful to include
cross-references to clauses in this standard where applicable to facilitate compliance checking by
auditors and business partners.

Risk assessment and treatment

4.1

Assessing security risks

Risk assessments should identify, quantify, and prioritize risks against criteria for risk acceptance and
objectives relevant to the organization. The results should guide and determine the appropriate
management action and priorities for managing information security risks and for implementing
controls selected to protect against these risks. The process of assessing risks and selecting controls
may need to be performed a number of times to cover different parts of the organization or individual
information systems.
Risk assessment should include the systematic approach of estimating the magnitude of risks (risk
analysis) and the process of comparing the estimated risks against risk criteria to determine the
significance of the risks (risk evaluation).
Risk assessments should also be performed periodically to address changes in the security
requirements and in the risk situation, e.g. in the assets, threats, vulnerabilities, impacts, the risk
evaluation, and when significant changes occur. These risk assessments should be undertaken in a
methodical manner capable of producing comparable and reproducible results.
The information security risk assessment should have a clearly defined scope in order to be effective
and should include relationships with risk assessments in other areas, if appropriate.
The scope of a risk assessment can be either the whole organization, parts of the organization, an
individual information system, specific system components, or services where this is practicable,
realistic, and helpful. Examples of risk assessment methodologies are discussed in ISO/IEC TR
13335-3 (Guidelines for the Management of IT Security: Techniques for the Management of IT
Security).

4.2

Treating security risks

Before considering the treatment of a risk, the organization should decide criteria for determining
whether or not risks can be accepted. Risks may be accepted if, for example, it is assessed that the risk
is low or that the cost of treatment is not cost-effective for the organization. Such decisions should be
recorded.
For each of the risks identified following the risk assessment a risk treatment decision needs to be
made. Possible options for risk treatment include:
a) applying appropriate controls to reduce the risks;
b) knowingly and objectively accepting risks, providing they clearly satisfy the
organization’s policy and criteria for risk acceptance;
c) avoiding risks by not allowing actions that would cause the risks to occur;
d) transferring the associated risks to other parties, e.g. insurers or suppliers.
For those risks where the risk treatment decision has been to apply appropriate controls, these controls
should be selected and implemented to meet the requirements identified by a risk assessment. Controls
should ensure that risks are reduced to an acceptable level taking into account:
a) requirements and constraints of national and international legislation and regulations;
b) organizational objectives;
c) operational requirements and constraints;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
d) cost of implementation and operation in relation to the risks being reduced, and remaining
proportional to the organization’s requirements and constraints;
e) the need to balance the investment in implementation and operation of controls against the
harm likely to result from security failures.
Controls can be selected from this standard or from other control sets, or new controls can be designed
to meet the specific needs of the organization. It is necessary to recognize that some controls may not
be applicable to every information system or environment, and might not be practicable for all
organizations. As an example, 10.1.3 describes how duties may be segregated to prevent fraud and
error. It may not be possible for smaller organizations to segregate all duties and other ways of
achieving the same control objective may be necessary. As another example, 10.10 describes how
system use can be monitored and evidence collected. The described controls e.g. event logging, might
conflict with applicable legislation, such as privacy protection for customers or in the workplace.
Information security controls should be considered at the systems and projects requirements
specification and design stage. Failure to do so can result in additional costs and less effective
solutions, and maybe, in the worst case, inability to achieve adequate security.
It should be kept in mind that no set of controls can achieve complete security, and that additional
management action should be implemented to monitor, evaluate, and improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of security controls to support the organization’s aims.

Security policy

5.1

Information security policy

Objective: To provide management direction and support for information security in accordance with
business requirements and relevant laws and regulations.
Management should set a clear policy direction in line with business objectives and demonstrate
support for, and commitment to, information security through the issue and maintenance of an
information security policy across the organization.

5.1.1

Information security policy document

Control
An information security policy document should be approved by management, and published and
communicated to all employees and relevant external parties.
Implementation guidance
The information security policy document should state management commitment and set out the
organization’s approach to managing information security. The policy document should contain
statements concerning:
a) a definition of information security, its overall objectives and scope and the importance of
security as an enabling mechanism for information sharing (see introduction);
b) a statement of management intent, supporting the goals and principles of information
security in line with the business strategy and objectives;
c) a framework for setting control objectives and controls, including the structure of risk
assessment and risk management;
d) a brief explanation of the security policies, principles, standards, and compliance
requirements of particular importance to the organization, including:
1) compliance with legislative, regulatory, and contractual requirements;
2) security education, training, and awareness requirements;
3) business continuity management;
4) consequences of information security policy violations;
e) a definition of general and specific responsibilities for information security management,
including reporting information security incidents;
f) references to documentation which may support the policy, e.g. more detailed security
policies and procedures for specific information systems or security rules users should
comply with.
This information security policy should be communicated throughout the organization to users in a
form that is relevant, accessible and understandable to the intended reader.
Other information
The information security policy might be a part of a general policy document. If the information
security policy is distributed outside the organisation, care should be taken not to disclose sensitive
information. Further information can be found in the ISO/IEC 13335-1:2004.

5.1.2

Review of the information security policy

Control
The information security policy should be reviewed at planned intervals or if significant changes
occur to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.
Implementation guidance
The information security policy should have an owner who has approved management responsibility
for the development, review, and evaluation of the security policy. The review should include
assessing opportunities for improvement of the organization’s information security policy and
approach to managing information security in response to changes to the organizational environment,
business circumstances, legal conditions, or technical environment.
The review of the information security policy should take account of the results of management
reviews. There should be defined management review procedures, including a schedule or period of
the review.
The input to the management review should include information on:
a) feedback from interested parties;
b) results of independent reviews (see 6.1.8);
c) status of preventive and corrective actions (see 6.1.8 and 15.2.1);
d) results of previous management reviews;
e) process performance and information security policy compliance;
f) changes that could affect the organization’s approach to managing information security,
including changes to the organizational environment, business circumstances, resource
availability, contractual, regulatory, and legal conditions, or to the technical environment;
g) trends related to threats and vulnerabilities;
h) reported information security incidents (see 13.1);
i)

recommendations provided by relevant authorities (see 6.1.6).

The output from the management review should include any decisions and actions related to:
a) improvement of the organization’s approach to managing information security and its
processes;
b) improvement of control objectives and controls;
c) improvement in the allocation of resources and/or responsibilities.
A record of the management review should be maintained.
Management approval for the revised policy should be obtained.

Organization of information security

6.1

Internal organization

Objective: To manage information security within the organization.
A management framework should be established to initiate and control the implementation of
information security within the organization.
Management should approve the information security policy, assign security roles and co-ordinate and
review the implementation of security across the organization.
If necessary, a source of specialist information security advice should be established and made
available within the organization. Contacts with external security specialists or groups, including
relevant authorities, should be developed to keep up with industrial trends, monitor standards and
assessment methods and provide suitable liaison points when handling information security incidents.
A multi-disciplinary approach to information security should be encouraged.

6.1.1

Management commitment to information security

Control
Management should actively support security within the organization through clear direction,
demonstrated commitment, explicit assignment, and acknowledgment of information security
responsibilities.
Implementation guidance
Management should:
a) ensure that information security goals are identified, meet the organizational
requirements, and are integrated in relevant processes;
b) formulate, review, and approve information security policy;
c) review the effectiveness of the implementation of the information security policy;
d) provide clear direction and visible management support for security initiatives;
e) provide the resources needed for information security;
f) approve assignment of specific roles and responsibilities for information security across
the organization;
g) initiate plans and programs to maintain information security awareness;
h) ensure that the implementation of information security controls is co-ordinated across
the organization (see 6.1.2).
Management should identify the needs for internal or external specialist information security advice,
and review and coordinate results of the advice throughout the organization.
Depending on the size of the organization, such responsibilities could be handled by a dedicated
management forum or by an existing management body, such as the board of directors.
Other information
Further information is contained in ISO/IEC 13335-1:2004.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)

6.1.2

Information security co-ordination

Control
Information security activities should be co-ordinated by representatives from different parts of the
organization with relevant roles and job functions.
Implementation guidance
Typically, information security co-ordination should involve the co-operation and collaboration of
managers, users, administrators, application designers, auditors and security personnel, and
specialist skills in areas such as insurance, legal issues, human resources, IT or risk management.
This activity should:
a) ensure that security activities are executed in compliance with the information security
policy;
b) identify how to handle non-compliances;
c) approve methodologies and processes for information security, e.g. risk assessment,
information classification;
d) identify significant threat changes and exposure of information and information
processing facilities to threats;
e) assess the adequacy and co-ordinate the implementation of information security
controls;
f) effectively promote information security education, training and awareness throughout
the organization;
g) evaluate information received from the monitoring and reviewing of information
security incidents, and recommend appropriate actions in response to identified
information security incidents.
If the organization does not use a separate cross-functional group, e.g. because such a group is not
appropriate for the organization’s size, the actions described above should be undertaken by another
suitable management body or individual manager.

6.1.3

Allocation of information security responsibilities

Control
All information security responsibilities should be clearly defined.
Implementation guidance
Allocation of information security responsibilities should be done in accordance with the information
security policy (see clause 4). Responsibilities for the protection of individual assets and for carrying
out specific security processes should be clearly identified. This responsibility should be
supplemented, where necessary, with more detailed guidance for specific sites and information
processing facilities. Local responsibilities for the protection of assets and for carrying out specific
security processes, such as business continuity planning, should be clearly defined.
Individuals with allocated security responsibilities may delegate security tasks to others. Nevertheless
they remain responsible and should determine that any delegated tasks have been correctly performed.
Areas for which individuals are responsible should be clearly stated; in particular the following should
take place:
a) the assets and security processes associated with each particular system should be
identified and clearly defined;
b) the entity responsible for each asset or security process should be assigned and the details
of this responsibility should be documented (see also 7.1.2);
c) authorization levels
should
bePEDDINTI
clearly defined and documented.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Other information
In many organizations an information security manager will be appointed to take overall responsibility
for the development and implementation of security and to support the identification of controls.
However, responsibility for resourcing and implementing the controls will often remain with
individual managers. One common practice is to appoint an owner for each asset who then becomes
responsible for its day-to-day protection.

6.1.4

Authorization process for information processing facilities

Control
A management authorization process for new information processing facilities should be defined and
implemented.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered for the authorization process:
a) new facilities should have appropriate user management authorization, authorizing their
purpose and use. Authorization should also be obtained from the manager responsible for
maintaining the local information system security environment to ensure that all relevant
security policies and requirements are met;
b) where necessary, hardware and software should be checked to ensure that they are
compatible with other system components;
c) the use of personal or privately owned information processing facilities, e.g. laptops,
home-computers or hand-held devices, for processing business information, may
introduce new vulnerabilities and necessary controls should be identified and
implemented.

6.1.5

Confidentiality agreements

Control
Requirements for confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements reflecting the organization’s needs for
the protection of information should be identified and regularly reviewed.
Implementation guidance
Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements should address the requirement to protect confidential
information using legally enforceable terms. To identify requirements for confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements, the following elements should be considered:
a) a definition of the information to be protected (e.g. confidential information);
b) expected duration of an agreement, including cases where confidentiality might need to be
maintained indefinitely;
c) required actions when an agreement is terminated;
d) responsibilities and actions of signatories to avoid unauthorized information disclosure
(such as ‘need to know’);
e) ownership of information, trade secrets and intellectual property, and how this relates to
the protection of confidential information;
f) the permitted use of confidential information, and rights of the signatory to use
information;
g) the right to audit and monitor activities that involve confidential information;

h) process for notification and reporting of unauthorized disclosure or confidential
information breaches;
i)

terms for information to be returned or destroyed at agreement cessation; and

j)

expected actions to be taken in case of a breach of this agreement.

Based on an organization’s security requirements, other elements may be needed in a confidentiality
or non-disclosure agreement.
Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements should comply with all applicable laws and regulations
for the jurisdiction to which it applies (see also 15.1.1).
Requirements for confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements should be reviewed periodically and
when changes occur that influence these requirements.
Other Information
Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements protect organisational information and inform
signatories of their responsibility to protect, use, and disclose information in a responsible and
authorised manner.
There may be a need for an organisation to use different forms of confidentiality or non-disclose
agreements in different circumstances.

6.1.6

Contact with authorities

Control
Appropriate contacts with relevant authorities should be maintained.
Implementation guidance
Organizations should have procedures in place that specify when and by whom authorities (e.g. law
enforcement, fire department, supervisory authorities) should be contacted, and how identified
information security incidents should be reported in a timely manner if it is suspected that laws may
have been broken.
Organizations under attack from the Internet may need external third parties (e.g. an Internet service
provider or telecommunications operator) to take action against the attack source.
Other information
Maintaining such contacts may be a requirement to support information security incident management
(Section 13.2) or the business continuity and contingency planning process (Section 14). Contacts
with regulatory bodies are also useful to anticipate and prepare for upcoming changes in law or
regulations, which have to be followed by the organization. Contacts with other authorities include
utilities, emergency services, and health and safety, e.g. fire departments (in connection with business
continuity), telecommunication providers (in connection with line routing and availability),
water suppliers (in connection with cooling facilities for equipment).

6.1.7

Contact with special interest groups

Control
Appropriate contacts with special interest groups or other specialist security forums and professional
associations should be maintained.
Implementation guidance
Membership in special interest groups or forums should be considered as a means to:
a) improve knowledge about best practices and staying up to date with relevant security
information;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
b) ensure the understanding of the information security environment is current and complete;
c) receive early warnings of alerts, advisories, and patches pertaining to attacks and
vulnerabilities;
d) gain access to specialist information security advice;
e) share and exchange information about new technologies, products, threats, or
vulnerabilities;
f) provide suitable liaison points when dealing with information security incidents (see also
13.2.1).
Other information
Information sharing agreements can be established to improve cooperation and coordination of
security issues. Such agreements should identify requirements for the protection of sensitive
information.

6.1.8

Independent review of information security

Control
The organization’s approach to managing information security and its implementation (i.e. control
objectives, controls, policies, processes, and procedures for information security) should be reviewed
independently at planned intervals, or when significant changes to the security implementation occur.
Implementation guidance
The independent review should be initiated by management. Such an independent review is necessary
to ensure the continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the organization's approach to
managing information security. The review should include assessing opportunities for improvement
and the need for changes to the approach to security, including the policy and control objectives.
Such a review should be carried out by individuals independent of the area under review, e.g. the
internal audit function, an independent manager or a third party organization specializing in such
reviews. Individuals carrying out these reviews should have the appropriate skills and experience.
The results of the independent review should be recorded and reported to the management who
initiated the review. These records should be maintained.
If the independent review identifies that the organization’s approach and implementation to managing
information security is inadequate or not compliant with the direction for information security stated
in the information security policy document (see 5.1.1), management should consider corrective
actions.
Other information
The area, which managers should regularly review (see 15.2.1), may also be reviewed independently.
Review techniques may include interviews of management, checking records or review of security
policy documents. ISO 19011:2002, Guidelines for quality and/or environmental management
systems auditing, may also provide helpful guidance for carrying out the independent review,
including establishment and implementation of a review programme. Section 15.3 specifies controls
relevant to the independent review of operational information systems and the use of system audit
tools.

6.2

External parties

Objective: To maintain the security of the organization’s information and information processing
facilities that are accessed, processed, communicated to, or managed by external parties.
The security of the organization’s information and information processing facilities should not be
reduced by the introduction of external party products or services.
Any access to the organization’s information processing facilities and processing and communication
of information by external parties should be controlled.
Where there is a business need for working with external parties that may require access to the
organization’s information and information processing facilities, or in obtaining or providing a
product and service from or to an external party, a risk assessment should be carried out to determine
security implications and control requirements. Controls should be agreed and defined in an
agreement with the external party.

6.2.1

Identification of risks related to external parties

Control
The risks to the organization’s information and information processing facilities from business
processes involving external parties should be identified and appropriate controls implemented before
granting access.
Implementation guidance
Where there is a need to allow an external party access to the information processing facilities or
information of an organization, a risk assessment (see also Section 4) should be carried out to identify
any requirements for specific controls. The identification of risks related to external party access
should take into account the following issues:
a) the information processing facilities an external party is required to access;
b) the type of access the external party will have to the information and information
processing facilities, e.g.:
1)

physical access, e.g. to offices, computer rooms, filing cabinets;

2)

logical access, e.g. to an organization’s databases, information systems;

3)

network connectivity between the organization’s and the external party’s
network(s), e.g. permanent connection, remote access;

4)

whether the access is taking place on-site or off-site;

c) the value and sensitivity of the information involved, and its criticality for business
operations;
d) the controls necessary to protect information that is not intended to be accessible by
external parties;
e) the external party personnel involved in handling the organization’s information;
f) how the organization or personnel authorized to have access can be identified, the
authorization verified, and how often this needs to be reconfirmed;
g) the different means and controls employed by the external party when storing, processing,
communicating, sharing and exchanging information;
h) the impact of access not being available to the external party when required, and the
external party entering or receiving inaccurate or misleading information;
i)

practices and procedures to deal with information security incidents and potential
damages, and the terms and conditions for the continuation of external party access in the
case of an information security incident;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
j)

legal and regulatory requirements and other contractual obligations relevant to the
external party that should be taken into account;

k) how the interests of any other stakeholders may be affected by the arrangements.
Access by external parties to the organization’s information should not be provided until the
appropriate controls have been implemented and, where feasible, a contract has been signed defining
the terms and conditions for the connection or access and the working arrangement. Generally, all
security requirements resulting from work with external parties or internal controls should be reflected
by the agreement with the external party (see also 6.2.2 and 6.2.3).
It should be ensured that the external party is aware of their obligations, and accepts the
responsibilities and liabilities involved in accessing, processing, communicating, or managing the
organization’s information and information processing facilities.
Other information
Information might be put at risk by external parties with inadequate security management. Controls
should be identified and applied to administer external party access to information processing
facilities. For example, if there is a special need for confidentiality of the information, non-disclosure
agreements might be used.
Organizations may face risks associated with inter-organizational processes, management, and
communication if a high degree of outsourcing is applied, or where there are several external parties
involved.
The controls 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 cover different external party arrangements, e.g. including:
a) service providers, such as ISPs, network providers, telephone services, maintenance and
support services;
b) managed security services;
c) customers;
d) outsourcing of facilities and/or operations, e.g. IT systems, data collection services, call
centre operations;
e) management and business consultants, and auditors;
f) developers and suppliers, e.g. of software products and IT systems;
g) cleaning, catering, and other outsourced support services;
h) temporary personnel, student placement, and other casual short-term appointments.
Such agreements can help to reduce the risks associated with external parties.

6.2.2

Addressing security when dealing with customers

Control
All identified security requirements should be addressed before giving customers access to the
organization’s information or assets.
Implementation guidance
The following terms should be considered to address security prior to giving customers access to any
of the organization’s assets (depending on the type and extent of access given, not all of them might
apply):
a) asset protection, including:
1) procedures to protect the organization’s assets, including information and software,
and management of known vulnerabilities;

15

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
2) procedures to determine whether any compromise of the assets, e.g. loss or
modification of data, has occurred;
3) integrity;
4) restrictions on copying and disclosing information;
b) description of the product or service to be provided;
c) the different reasons, requirements, and benefits for customer access;
d) access control policy, covering:
1) permitted access methods, and the control and use of unique identifiers such as user
IDs and passwords;
2) an authorization process for user access and privileges;
3) a statement that all access that is not explicitly authorised is forbidden;
4) a process for revoking access rights or interrupting the connection between systems;
e) arrangements for reporting, notification, and investigation of information inaccuracies
(e.g. of personal details), information security incidents and security breaches;
f) a description of each service to be made available;
g) the target level of service and unacceptable levels of service;
h) the right to monitor, and revoke, any activity related to the organization’s assets;
i)

the respective liabilities of the organization and the customer;

j)

responsibilities with respect to legal matters and how it is ensured that the legal
requirements are met, e.g. data protection legislation, especially taking into account
different national legal systems if the agreement involves co-operation with customers in
other countries (see also 15.1);

k) intellectual property rights (IPRs) and copyright assignment (see 15.1.2) and protection of
any collaborative work (see also 6.1.5).
Other information
The security requirements related to customers accessing organizational assets can vary considerably
depending on the information processing facilities and information being accessed. These security
requirements can be addressed using customer agreements, which contain all identified risks and
security requirements (see 6.2.1).
Agreements with external parties may also involve other parties. Agreements granting external party
access should include allowance for designation of other eligible parties and conditions for their
access and involvement.

6.2.3

Addressing security in third party agreements

Control
Agreements with third parties involving accessing, processing, communicating or managing the
organization’s information or information processing facilities, or adding products or services to
information processing facilities should cover all relevant security requirements.
Implementation guidance
The agreement should ensure that there is no misunderstanding between the organization and the third
party. Organizations should satisfy themselves as to the indemnity of the third party.

1) procedures to protect organizational assets, including information, software and
hardware;
2) any required physical protection controls and mechanisms;
3) controls to ensure protection against malicious software (see 10.4.1);
4) procedures to determine whether any compromise of the assets, e.g. loss or
modification of information, software and hardware, has occurred;
5) controls to ensure the return or destruction of information and assets at the end of, or
at an agreed point in time during, the agreement;
6) confidentiality, integrity, availability, and any other relevant property (see 2.1.5) of
the assets;
7) restrictions on copying and disclosing information, and using confidentiality
agreements (see 6.1.5);
c) user and administrator training in methods, procedures, and security;
d) ensuring user awareness for information security responsibilities and issues;

o) the right to audit responsibilities defined in the agreement, to have those audits carried out
by a third party, and to enumerate the statutory rights of auditors;
p) the establishment of an escalation process for problem resolution;
q) service continuity requirements, including measures for availability and reliability, in
accordance with an organization’s business priorities;
r) the respective liabilities of the parties to the agreement;
s) responsibilities with respect to legal matters and how it is ensured that the legal
requirements are met, e.g. data protection legislation, especially taking into account
different national legal systems if the agreement involves co-operation with organizations
in other countries (see also 15.1);
t)

intellectual property rights (IPRs) and copyright assignment (see 15.1.2) and protection of
any collaborative work (see also 6.1.5);

u) involvement of the third party with subcontractors, and the security controls these
subcontractors need to implement;
v) conditions for renegotiation/termination of agreements:
1) a contingency plan should be in place in case either party wishes to terminate the
relation before the end of the agreements;
2) renegotiation of agreements if the security requirements of the organization change;
3) current documentation of asset lists, licences, agreements or rights relating to them.
Other information
The agreements can vary considerably for different organizations and among the different types of
third parties. Therefore, care should be taken to include all identified risks and security requirements
(see also 6.2.1) in the agreements. Where necessary, the required controls and procedures can be
expanded in a security management plan.
If information security management is outsourced, the agreements should address how the third party
will guarantee that adequate security, as defined by the risk assessment, will be maintained, and how
security will be adapted to identify and deal with changes to risks.
Some of the differences between outsourcing and the other forms of third party service provision
include the question of liability, planning the transition period and potential disruption of operations
during this period, contingency planning arrangements and due diligence reviews, and collection and
management of information on security incidents. Therefore, it is important that the organization
plans and manages the transition to an outsourced arrangement and has suitable processes in place to
manage changes and the renegotiation/termination of agreements.
The procedures for continuing processing in the event that the third party becomes unable to supply its
services need to be considered in the agreement to avoid any delay in arranging replacement services.
Agreements with third parties may also involve other parties. Agreements granting third party access
should include allowance for designation of other eligible parties and conditions for their access and
involvement.
Generally agreements are primarily developed by the organization. There may be occasions in some
circumstances where an agreement may be developed and imposed upon an organization by a third
party. The organization needs to ensure that its own security is not unnecessarily impacted by third
party requirements stipulated in imposed agreements.

Asset management

7.1

Responsibility for assets

Objective: To achieve and maintain appropriate protection of organizational assets.
All assets should be accounted for and have a nominated owner.
Owners should be identified for all assets and the responsibility for the maintenance of appropriate
controls should be assigned. The implementation of specific controls may be delegated by the owner
as appropriate but the owner remains responsible for the proper protection of the assets.

7.1.1

Inventory of assets

Control
All assets should be clearly identified and an inventory of all important assets drawn up and
maintained.
Implementation guidance
An organization should identify all assets and document the importance of these assets. The asset
inventory should include all information necessary in order to recover from a disaster, including type
of asset, format, location, backup information, license information, and a business value. The
inventory should not duplicate other inventories unnecessarily, but it should be ensured that the
content is aligned.
In addition, ownership (see 7.1.2) and information classification (see 7.2) should be agreed and
documented for each of the assets. Based on the importance of the asset, its business value and its
security classification, levels of protection commensurate with the importance of the assets should be
identified (more information on how to value assets to represent their importance can be found in
ISO/IEC TR 13335-3).
Other information
There are many types of assets, including:
a) information: databases and data files, contracts and agreements, system documentation,
research information, user manuals, training material, operational or support procedures,
business continuity plans, fallback arrangements, audit trails, and archived information;
b) software assets: application software, system software, development tools, and utilities;
c) physical assets: computer equipment, communications equipment, removable media, and
other equipment;
d) services: computing and communications services, general utilities, e.g. heating, lighting,
power, and air-conditioning;
e) people, and their qualifications, skills, and experience;
f) intangibles, such as reputation and image of the organization.
Inventories of assets help to ensure that effective asset protection takes place, and may also be
required for other business purposes, such as health and safety, insurance or financial (asset
management) reasons. The process of compiling an inventory of assets is an important prerequisite of
risk management (see also Section 4).

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)

7.1.2

Ownership of assets

Control
All information and assets associated with information processing facilities should be owned2 by a
designated part of the organization.
Implementation guidance
The asset owner should be responsible for:
a) ensuring that information and assets associated with information processing facilities are
appropriately classified;
b) defining and periodically reviewing access restrictions and classifications, taking into
account applicable access control policies.
Ownership may be allocated to:
a) a business process;
b) a defined set of activities;
c) an application; or
d) a defined set of data.
Other information
Routine tasks may be delegated, e.g. to a custodian looking after the asset on a daily basis, but the
responsibility remains with the owner.
In complex information systems it may be useful to designate groups of assets, which act together to
provide a particular function as ‘services’. In this case the service owner is responsible for the delivery
of the service, including the functioning of the assets, which provide it.

7.1.3

Acceptable use of assets

Control
Rules for the acceptable use of information and assets associated with information processing
facilities should be identified, documented, and implemented.
Implementation guidance
All employees, contractors and third party users should follow rules for the acceptable use of
information and assets associated with information processing facilities, including:
a) rules for electronic mail and Internet usages (see 10.8);
b) guidelines for the use of mobile devices, especially for the use outside the premises of the
organization (see 11.7.1);
Specific rules or guidance should be provided by the relevant management. Employees, contractors
and third party users using or having access to the organization’s assets should be aware of the limits
existing for their use of organization’s information and assets associated with information processing
facilities, and resources. They should be responsible for their use of any information processing
resources, and of any such use carried out under their responsibility.

2

The term ‘owner’ identifies an individual or entity that has approved management responsibility for
controlling the production, development, maintenance, use and security of the assets. The term
’owner’ does not mean that the person actually has any property rights to the asset.

7.2

Information classification

Objective: To ensure that information receives an appropriate level of protection.
Information should be classified to indicate the need, priorities, and expected degree of protection
when handling the information.
Information has varying degrees of sensitivity and criticality. Some items may require an additional
level of protection or special handling. An information classification scheme should be used to define
an appropriate set of protection levels and communicate the need for special handling measures.

7.2.1

Classification guidelines

Control
Information should be classified in terms of its value, legal requirements, sensitivity, and criticality to
the organization.
Implementation guidance
Classifications and associated protective controls for information should take account of business
needs for sharing or restricting information and the business impacts associated with such needs.
Classification guidelines should include conventions for initial classification and reclassification over
time; in accordance with some predetermined access control policy (see 11.1.1).
It should be the responsibility of the asset owner (see 7.1.2) to define the classification of an asset,
periodically review it, and ensure it is kept up to date and at the appropriate level. The classification
should take account of the aggregation effect mentioned in 10.7.2.
Consideration should be given to the number of classification categories and the benefits to be gained
from their use. Overly complex schemes may become cumbersome and uneconomic to use or prove
impractical. Care should be taken in interpreting classification labels on documents from other
organizations, which may have different definitions for the same or similarly named labels.
Other Information
The level of protection can be assessed by analyzing confidentiality, integrity and availability and any
other requirements for the information considered.
Information often ceases to be sensitive or critical after a certain period of time, for example, when the
information has been made public. These aspects should be taken into account, as over-classification
can lead to the implementation of unnecessary controls resulting in additional expense.
Considering documents with similar security requirements together when assigning classification
levels might help to simplify the classification task.
In general, the classification given to information is a shorthand way of determining how this
information is to be handled and protected.

7.2.2

Information labeling and handling

Control
An appropriate set of procedures for information labeling and handling should be developed and
implemented in accordance with the classification scheme adopted by the organization.
Implementation guidance
Procedures for information labeling need to cover information assets in physical and electronic
formats.

21

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Output from systems containing information that is classified as being sensitive or critical should
carry an appropriate classification label (in the output). The labeling should reflect the classification
according to the rules established in 7.2.1. Items for consideration include printed reports, screen
displays, recorded media (e.g. tapes, disks, CDs), electronic messages, and file transfers.
For each classification level, handling procedures including the secure processing, storage,
transmission, declassification, and destruction should be defined. This should also include the
procedures for chain of custody and logging of any security relevant event.
Agreements with other organizations that include information sharing should include procedures to
identify the classification of that information and to interpret the classification labels from other
organizations.
Other Information
Labeling and secure handling of classified information is a key requirement for information sharing
arrangements. Physical labels are a common form of labeling. However, some information assets,
such as documents in electronic form, cannot be physically labeled and electronic means of labeling
need to be used. For example, notification labeling may appear on the screen or display. Where
labeling is not feasible, other means of designating the classification of information may be applied,
e.g. via procedures or meta-data.

Human resources security

8.1

Prior to employment3

Objective: To ensure that employees, contractors and third party users understand their
responsibilities, and are suitable for the roles they are considered for, and to reduce the risk of theft,
fraud or misuse of facilities.
Security responsibilities should be addressed prior to employment in adequate job descriptions and in
terms and conditions of employment.
All candidates for employment, contractors and third party users should be adequately screened,
especially for sensitive jobs.
Employees, contractors and third party users of information processing facilities should sign an
agreement on their security roles and responsibilities.

8.1.1

Roles and responsibilities

Control
Security roles and responsibilities of employees, contractors and third party users should be defined
and documented in accordance with the organization’s information security policy.
Implementation guidance
Security roles and responsibilities should include the requirement to:
a) implement and act in accordance with the organization’s information security policies
(see 5.1);
b) protect assets from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, destruction or
interference;
c) execute particular security processes or activities;
d) ensure responsibility is assigned to the individual for actions taken;
e) report security events or potential events or other security risks to the organization.
Security roles and responsibilities should be defined and clearly communicated to job candidates
during the pre-employment process.
Other Information
Job descriptions can be used to document security roles and responsibilities. Security roles and
responsibilities for individuals not engaged via the organization’s employment process, e.g. engaged
via a third party organization, should also be clearly defined and communicated.

8.1.2

Screening

Control
Background verification checks on all candidates for employment, contractors, and third party users
should be carried out in accordance with relevant laws, regulations and ethics, and proportional to the
business requirements, the classification of the information to be accessed, and the perceived risks.

3

Explanation: The word ’employment’ is meant here to cover all of the following different situations:
employment of people (temporary or longer lasting), appointment of job roles, changing of job roles, assignment
of contracts, and the termination of any of these arrangements.

23

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Implementation guidance
Verification checks should take into account all relevant privacy, protection of personal data and/or
employment based legislation, and should, where permitted, include the following:
a) availability of satisfactory character references, e.g. one business and one personal;
b) a check (for completeness and accuracy) of the applicant’s curriculum vitae;
c) confirmation of claimed academic and professional qualifications;
d) independent identity check (passport or similar document);
e) more detailed checks, such as credit checks or checks of criminal records.
Where a job, either on initial appointment or on promotion, involves the person having access to
information processing facilities, and in particular if these are handling sensitive information, e.g.
financial information or highly confidential information, the organization should also consider further,
more detailed checks.
Procedures should define criteria and limitations for verification checks, e.g. who is eligible to screen
people, and how, when and why verification checks are carried out.
A screening process should also be carried out for contractors, and third party users. Where
contractors are provided through an agency the contract with the agency should clearly specify the
agency’s responsibilities for screening and the notification procedures they need to follow if screening
has not been completed or if the results give cause for doubt or concern. In the same way, the
agreement with the third party (see also 6.2.3) should clearly specify all responsibilities and
notification procedures for screening.
Information on all candidates being considered for positions within the organization should be
collected and handled in accordance with any appropriate legislation existing in the relevant
jurisdiction. Depending on applicable legislation, the candidates should be informed beforehand about
the screening activities.

8.1.3

Terms and conditions of employment

Control
As part of their contractual obligation, employees, contractors and third party users should agree and
sign the terms and conditions of their employment contract, which should state their and the
organization’s responsibilities for information security.
Implementation guidance
The terms and conditions of employment should reflect the organization’s security policy in addition
to clarifying and stating:
a) that all employees, contractors and third party users who are given access to sensitive
information should sign a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement prior to being given

e) responsibilities of the organization for the handling of personal information, including
personal information created as a result of, or in the course of, employment with the
organization (see also 15.1.4);
f) responsibilities that are extended outside the organization’s premises and outside normal
working hours, e.g. in the case of home-working (see also 9.2.5 and 11.7.1);
g) actions to be taken if the employee, contractor or third party user disregards the
organization’s security requirements (see also 8.2.3).
The organization should ensure that employees, contractors and third party users agree to terms and
conditions concerning information security appropriate to the nature and extent of access they will
have to the organization’s assets associated with information systems and services.
Where appropriate, responsibilities contained within the terms and conditions of employment should
continue for a defined period after the end of the employment (see also 8.3).
Other Information
A code of conduct may be used to cover the employee’s, contractor’s or third party user’s
responsibilities regarding confidentiality, data protection, ethics, appropriate use of the organization’s
equipment and facilities, as well as reputable practices expected by the organization. The contractor
or third party users may be associated with an external organization that may in turn be required to
enter in contractual arrangements on behalf of the contracted individual.

8.2

During employment

Objective: To ensure that employees, contractors and third party users are aware of information
security threats and concerns, their responsibilities and liabilities, and are equipped to support
organizational security policy in the course of their normal work, and to reduce the risk of human
error.
Management responsibilities should be defined to ensure that security is applied throughout an
individual’s employment within the organization.
An adequate level of awareness, education, and training in security procedures and the correct use of
information processing facilities should be provided to all employees, contractors and third party users
to minimize possible security risks. A formal disciplinary process for handling security breaches
should be established.

8.2.1

Management responsibilities

Control
Management should require employees, contractors and third party users to apply security in
accordance with established policies and procedures of the organization.
Implementation guidance
Management responsibilities should include ensuring that employees, contractors and third party
users:
a) are properly briefed on their information security roles and responsibilities prior to being
granted access to sensitive information or information systems;
b) are provided with guidelines to state security expectations of their role within the
organization;
c) are motivated to fulfil the security policies of the organization;

25

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
d) achieve a level of awareness on security relevant to their roles and responsibilities within
the organization (see also 8.2.2);
e) conform to the terms and conditions of employment, which includes the organization’s
information security policy and appropriate methods of working;
f) continue to have the appropriate skills and qualifications.
Other Information
If employees, contractors and third party users are not made aware of their security responsibilities,
they can cause considerable damage to an organization. Motivated personnel are likely to be more
reliable and cause less information security incidents.
Poor management may cause personnel to feel undervalued resulting in a negative security impact to
the organization. For example, poor management may lead to security being neglected or potential
misuse of the organization’s assets.

8.2.2

Information security awareness, education, and training

Control
All employees of the organization and, where relevant, contractors and third party users should
receive appropriate awareness training and regular updates in organizational policies and procedures,
as relevant for their job function.
Implementation guidance
Awareness training should commence with a formal induction process designed to introduce the
organization’s security policies and expectations before access to information or services is granted.
Ongoing training should include security requirements, legal responsibilities and business controls, as
well as training in the correct use of information processing facilities e.g. log-on procedure, use of
software packages and information on the disciplinary process (see 8.2.3).
Other Information
The security awareness, education, and training activities should be suitable and relevant to the
person’s role, responsibilities and skills, and should include information on known threats, who to
contact for further security advice and the proper channels for reporting information security incidents
(see also 13.1).
Training to enhance awareness is intended to allow individuals to recognize information security
problems and incidents, and respond according to the needs of their work role.

8.2.3

Disciplinary process

Control
There should be a formal disciplinary process for employees who have committed a security breach.
Implementation guidance
The disciplinary process should not be commenced without prior verification that a security breach
has occurred (see also 13.2.3 for collection of evidence).
The formal disciplinary process should ensure correct and fair treatment for employees who are
suspected of committing breaches of security. The formal disciplinary process should provide for a
graduated response that takes into consideration factors such as the nature and gravity of the breach
and its impact on business, whether or not this is a first or repeat offence, whether or not the violator
was properly trained, relevant legislation, business contracts and other factors as required. In serious
cases of misconduct the process should allow for instant removal of duties, access rights and
privileges, and for immediate escorting out of the site, if necessary.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Other Information
The disciplinary process should also be used as a deterrent to prevent employees, contractors and third
party users in violating organizational security policies and procedures, and any other security
breaches.

8.3

Termination or change of employment

Objective: To ensure that employees, contractors and third party users exit an organization or change
employment in an orderly manner.
Responsibilities should be in place to ensure an employee’s, contractor’s or third party user’s exit
from the organization is managed, and that the return of all equipment and the removal of all access
rights are completed.
Change of responsibilities and employments within an organization should be managed as the
termination of the respective responsibility or employment in line with this section, and any new
employments should be managed as described in section 8.1.

8.3.1

Termination responsibilities

Control
Responsibilities for performing employment termination or change of employment should be clearly
defined and assigned.
Implementation guidance
The communication of termination responsibilities should include ongoing security requirements and
legal responsibilities and, where appropriate, responsibilities contained within any confidentiality
agreement (see 6.1.5), and the terms and conditions of employment (see 8.1.3) continuing for a
defined period after the end of the employee’s, contractor’s or third party user’s employment.
Responsibilities and duties still valid after termination of employment should be contained in
employee’s, contractor’s or third party user’s contracts.
Changes of responsibility or employment should be managed as the termination of the respective
responsibility or employment, and the new responsibility or employment should be controlled as
described in clause 8.1.
Other Information
The Human Resources function is generally responsible for the overall termination process and works
together with the supervising manager of the person leaving to manage the security aspects of the
relevant procedures. In the case of a contractor, this termination responsibility process may be
undertaken by an agency responsible for the contractor, and in case of an other user this might be
handled by their organization.
It may be necessary to inform employees, customers, contractors, or third party users of changes to
personnel and operating arrangements.

8.3.2

Return of assets

Control
All employees, contractors and third party users should return all of the organization’s assets in their
possession upon termination of their employment, contract or agreement.

27

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Implementation guidance
The termination process should be formalized to include the return of all previously issued software,
corporate documents, and equipment. Other organizational assets such as mobile computing devices,
credit cards, access cards, software, manuals, and information stored on electronic media also need to
be returned.
In cases where an employee, contractor or third party user purchases the organization’s equipment or
uses their own personal equipment, procedures should be followed to ensure that all relevant
information is transferred to the organization and securely erased from the equipment (see also
10.7.1).
In cases where an employee, contractor or third party user has knowledge that is important to ongoing
operations, that information should be documented and transferred to the organization.

8.3.3

Removal of access rights

Control
The access rights of all employees, contractors and third party users to information and information
processing facilities should be removed upon termination of their employment, contract or agreement,
or adjusted upon change.
Implementation guidance
Upon termination, the access rights of an individual to assets associated with information systems and
services should be reconsidered. This will determine whether it is necessary to remove access rights.
Changes of an employment should be reflected in removal of all access rights that were not approved
for the new employment. The access rights that should be removed or adapted include physical and
logical access, keys, identification cards, information processing facilities (see also 11.2.4),
subscriptions, and removal from any documentation that identifies them as a current member of the
organization. If a departing employee, contractor or third party user has known passwords for
accounts remaining active, these should be changed upon termination or change of employment,
contract or agreement.
Access rights for information assets and information processing facilities should be reduced or
removed before the employment terminates or changes, depending on the evaluation of risk factors
such as:
a) whether the termination or change is initiated by the employee, contractor or third party
user, or by management and the reason of termination;
b) the current responsibilities of the employee, contractor or any other user;
c) the value of the assets currently accessible.
Other Information
In certain circumstances access rights may be allocated on the basis of being available to more people
than the departing employee, contractor or third party user, e.g. group IDs. In such circumstances,
departing individuals should be removed from any group access lists and arrangements should be
made to advise all other employees, contractors and third party users involved to no longer share this
information with the person departing.
In cases of management-initiated termination, disgruntled employees, contractors or third party users
may deliberately corrupt information or sabotage information processing facilities. In cases of persons
resigning, they may be tempted to collect information for future use.

Physical and environmental security

9.1

Secure areas

Objective: To prevent unauthorized physical access, damage, and interference to the organization’s
premises and information.
Critical or sensitive information processing facilities should be housed in secure areas, protected by
defined security perimeters, with appropriate security barriers and entry controls. They should be
physically protected from unauthorized access, damage, and interference.
The protection provided should be commensurate with the identified risks.

9.1.1

Physical security perimeter

Control
Security perimeters (barriers such as walls, card controlled entry gates or manned reception desks)
should be used to protect areas that contain information and information processing facilities.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered and implemented where appropriate for physical
security perimeters:
a) security perimeters should be clearly defined, and the siting and strength of each of the
perimeters should depend on the security requirements of the assets within the perimeter
and the results of a risk assessment;
b) perimeters of a building or site containing information processing facilities should be
physically sound (i.e. there should be no gaps in the perimeter or areas where a break-in
could easily occur); the external walls of the site should be of solid construction and all
external doors should be suitably protected against unauthorized access with control
mechanisms, e.g. bars, alarms, locks etc; doors and windows should be locked when
unattended and external protection should be considered for windows, particularly at
ground level;
c) a manned reception area or other means to control physical access to the site or building
should be in place; access to sites and buildings should be restricted to authorized
personnel only;
d) physical barriers should, where applicable, be built to prevent unauthorized physical
access and environmental contamination;
e) all fire doors on a security perimeter should be alarmed, monitored, and tested in
conjunction with the walls to establish the required level of resistance in accordance to
suitable regional, national, and international standards; they should operate in accordance
with local fire code in a failsafe manner;
f) suitable intruder detection systems should be installed to national, regional or
international standards and regularly tested to cover all external doors and accessible
windows; unoccupied areas should be alarmed at all times; cover should also be provided
for other areas, e.g. computer room or communications rooms;
g) information processing facilities managed by the organization should be physically
separated from those managed by third parties.

29

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Other information
Physical protection can be achieved by creating one or more physical barriers around the
organization’s premises and information processing facilities. The use of multiple barriers gives
additional protection, where the failure of a single barrier does not mean that security is immediately
compromised.
A secure area may be a lockable office, or several rooms surrounded by a continuous internal physical
security barrier. Additional barriers and perimeters to control physical access may be needed between
areas with different security requirements inside the security perimeter.
Special consideration towards physical access security should be given to buildings where multiple
organizations are housed.

9.1.2

Physical entry controls

Control
Secure areas should be protected by appropriate entry controls to ensure that only authorized
personnel are allowed access.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered:
a) the date and time of entry and departure of visitors should be recorded, and all visitors
should be supervised unless their access has been previously approved; they should only
be granted access for specific, authorized purposes and should be issued with instructions
on the security requirements of the area and on emergency procedures.
b) access to areas where sensitive information is processed or stored should be controlled
and restricted to authorized persons only; authentication controls, e.g. access control card
plus PIN, should be used to authorize and validate all access; an audit trail of all access
should be securely maintained;
c) all employees, contractors and third party users and all visitors should be required to wear
some form of visible identification and should immediately notify security personnel if
they encounter unescorted visitors and anyone not wearing visible identification;
d) third party support service personnel should be granted restricted access to secure areas or
sensitive information processing facilities only when required; this access should be
authorized and monitored;
e) access rights to secure areas should be regularly reviewed and updated, and revoked when
necessary (see 8.3.3).

a neighbouring building, water leaking from the roof or in floors below ground level or an explosion
in the street.
The following guidelines should be considered to avoid damage from fire, flood, earthquake,
explosion, civil unrest, and other forms of natural or man-made disaster:
a) hazardous or combustible materials should be stored at a safe distance from a secure area.
Bulk supplies such as stationery should not be stored within a secure area;
b) fallback equipment and back-up media should be sited at a safe distance to avoid damage
from a disaster affecting the main site;
c) appropriate fire fighting equipment should be provided and suitably placed.

9.1.5

Working in secure areas

Control
Physical protection and guidelines for working in secure areas should be designed and applied.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered:
a) personnel should only be aware of the existence of, or activities within, a secure area on a
need to know basis;
b) unsupervised working in secure areas should be avoided both for safety reasons and to
prevent opportunities for malicious activities;
c) vacant secure areas should be physically locked and periodically checked;
d) photographic, video, audio or other recording equipment, such as cameras in mobile

Public access, delivery, and loading areas

Control
Access points such as delivery and loading areas and other points where unauthorized persons may
enter the premises should be controlled and, if possible, isolated from information processing facilities
to avoid unauthorized access.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered:
a) access to a delivery and loading area from outside of the building should be restricted to
identified and authorized personnel;
b) the delivery and loading area should be designed so that supplies can be unloaded without
delivery personnel gaining access to other parts of the building;
c) the external doors of a delivery and loading area should be secured when the internal
doors are opened;
d) incoming material should be inspected for potential threats (see 9.2.1d)) before this
material is moved from the delivery and loading area to the point of use;
e) incoming material should be registered in accordance with asset management procedures
(see also 7.1.1) on entry to the site;
f) incoming and outgoing shipments should be physically segregated, where possible.

9.2

Equipment security

Objective: To prevent loss, damage, theft or compromise of assets and interruption to the
organization’s activities.
Equipment should be protected from physical and environmental threats.
Protection of equipment (including that used off-site, and the removal of property) is necessary to
reduce the risk of unauthorized access to information and to protect against loss or damage. This
should also consider equipment siting and disposal. Special controls may be required to protect
against physical threats, and to safeguard supporting facilities, such as the electrical supply and
cabling infrastructure.

9.2.1

Equipment siting and protection

Control
Equipment should be sited or protected to reduce the risks from environmental threats and hazards,
and opportunities for unauthorized access.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered to protect equipment:
a) equipment should be sited to minimize unnecessary access into work areas;
b) information processing facilities handling sensitive data should be positioned and the
viewing angle restricted to reduce the risk of information being viewed by unauthorized
persons during their use, and storage facilities secured to avoid unauthorized access;
c) items requiring special protection should be isolated to reduce the general level of
protection required;
d) controls should be adopted to minimize the risk of potential physical threats, e.g. theft,
fire, explosives, smoke, water (or water supply failure), dust, vibration, chemical effects,
electrical supply interference, communications interference, electromagnetic radiation,

i)

9.2.2

equipment processing sensitive information should be protected to minimize the risk of
information leakage due to emanation.

Supporting utilities

Control
Equipment should be protected from power failures and other disruptions caused by failures in
supporting utilities.
Implementation guidance
All supporting utilities, such as electricity, water supply, sewage, heating/ventilation, and air
conditioning should be adequate for the systems they are supporting. Support utilities should be
regularly inspected and as appropriate tested to ensure their proper functioning and to reduce any risk
from their malfunction or failure. A suitable electrical supply should be provided that conforms to the
equipment manufacturer’s specifications.
An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to support orderly close down or continuous running is
recommended for equipment supporting critical business operations. Power contingency plans should
cover the action to be taken on failure of the UPS. A back-up generator should be considered if
processing is required to continue in case of a prolonged power failure. An adequate supply of fuel
should be available to ensure that the generator can perform for a prolonged period. UPS equipment
and generators should be regularly checked to ensure it has adequate capacity and is tested in accordance
with the manufacturer’s recommendations. In addition, consideration could be given to using multiple
power sources or, if the site is large, a separate power substation.
Emergency power off switches should be located near emergency exits in equipment rooms to
facilitate rapid power down in case of an emergency. Emergency lighting should be provided in case
of main power failure.
The water supply should be stable and adequate to supply air conditioning, humidification equipment
and fire suppression systems (where used). Malfunctions in the water supply system may damage
equipment or prevent fire suppression from acting effectively. An alarm system to detect malfunctions
in the supporting utilities should be evaluated and installed if required.
Telecommunications equipment should be connected to the utility provider by at least two diverse
routes to prevent failure in one connection path removing voice services. Voice services should be
adequate to meet local legal requirements for emergency communications.
Other information
Options to achieve continuity of power supplies include multiple feeds to avoid a single point of
failure in the power supply.

Security of equipment off-premises

Control
Security should be applied to off-site equipment taking into account the different risks of working
outside the organization’s premises.
Implementation guidance
Regardless of ownership, the use of any information processing equipment outside the organization’s
premises should be authorized by management.
The following guidelines should be considered for the protection of off-site equipment:
a) equipment and media taken off the premises should not be left unattended in public
places; portable computers should be carried as hand luggage and disguised where
possible when travelling;
b) manufacturers’ instructions for protecting equipment should be observed at all times, e.g.
protection against exposure to strong electromagnetic fields;
c) home-working controls should be determined by a risk assessment and suitable controls
applied as appropriate, e.g. lockable filing cabinets, clear desk policy, access controls for
computers and secure communication with the office (see also ISO/IEC 18028 Network
Security);
d) adequate insurance cover should be in place to protect equipment off-site.
Security risks, e.g. of damage, theft or eavesdropping, may vary considerably between locations and
should be taken into account in determining the most appropriate controls.
Other information
Information storing and processing equipment includes all forms of personal computers, organizers,
mobile phones, smart cards, paper or other form, which is held for home working or being transported
away from the normal work location.
More information about other aspects of protecting mobile equipment can be found in 11.7.1.

9.2.6

Secure disposal or re-use of equipment

Control
All items of equipment containing storage media should be checked to ensure that any sensitive data
and licensed software has been removed or securely overwritten prior to disposal.
Implementation guidance
Devices containing sensitive information should be physically destroyed or the information should be
destroyed, deleted or overwritten using techniques to make the original information non-retrievable
rather than using the standard delete or format function.
Other information
Damaged devices containing sensitive data may require a risk assessment to determine whether the
items should be physically destroyed rather than sent for repair or discarded.
Information can be compromised through careless disposal or re-use of equipment (see also 10.7.2).

from failed jobs (see 10.7.2 and 10.7.3);
g) system restart and recovery procedures for use in the event of system failure;
h) the management of audit-trail and system log information (see 10.10).
Operating procedures, and the documented procedures for system activities, should be treated as
formal documents and changes authorized by management. Where technically feasible, information
systems should be managed consistently, using the same procedures, tools, and utilities.

10.1.2 Change management
Control
Changes to information processing facilities and systems should be controlled.
Implementation guidance
Operational systems and application software should be subject to strict change management control.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
In particular, the following items should be considered:
a) identification and recording of significant changes;
b) planning and testing of changes;
c) assessment of the potential impacts, including security impacts, of such changes;
d) formal approval procedure for proposed changes;
e) communication of change details to all relevant persons;
f) fallback procedures, including procedures and responsibilities for aborting and recovering
from unsuccessful changes and unforeseen events.
Formal management responsibilities and procedures should be in place to ensure satisfactory control
of all changes to equipment, software or procedures. When changes are made, an audit log containing
all relevant information should be retained.
Other information
Inadequate control of changes to information processing facilities and systems is a common cause of
system or security failures. Changes to the operational environment, especially when transferring a
system from development to operational stage, can impact on the reliability of applications (see also
12.5.1).
Changes to operational systems should only be made when there is a valid business reason to do so,
such as an increase in the risk to the system. Updating systems with the latest versions of operating
system or application is not always in the business interest as this could introduce more vulnerabilities
and instability than the current version. There may also be a need for additional training, license costs,
support, maintenance and administration overhead, and new hardware especially during migration.

10.1.3 Segregation of duties
Control
Duties and areas of responsibility should be segregated to reduce opportunities for unauthorized or
unintentional modification or misuse of the organization’s assets.
Implementation guidance
Segregation of duties is a method for reducing the risk of accidental or deliberate system misuse. Care
should be taken that no single person can access, modify or use assets without authorization or
detection. The initiation of an event should be separated from its authorization. The possibility of
collusion should be considered in designing the controls.
Small organizations may find segregation of duties difficult to achieve, but the principle should be
applied as far as is possible and practicable. Whenever it is difficult to segregate, other controls such
as monitoring of activities, audit trails and management supervision should be considered. It is
important that security audit remains independent.

10.1.4 Separation of development, test, and operational facilities
Control
Development, test, and operational facilities should be separated to reduce the risks of unauthorised
access or changes to the operational system.
Implementation guidance
The level of separation between operational, test, and development environments that is necessary to
prevent operational problems should be identified and appropriate controls implemented.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
The following items should be considered:
a) rules for the transfer of software from development to operational status should be defined
and documented;
b) development and operational software should run on different systems or computer
processors and in different domains or directories;
c) compilers, editors, and other development tools or system utilities should not be
accessible from operational systems when not required;
d) the test system environment should emulate the operational system environment as
closely as possible;
e) users should use different user profiles for operational and test systems, and menus should
display appropriate identification messages to reduce the risk of error;
f) sensitive data should not be copied into the test system environment (see 12.4.2).
Other information
Development and test activities can cause serious problems, e.g. unwanted modification of files or
system environment, or system failure. In this case, there is a need to maintain a known and stable
environment in which to perform meaningful testing and to prevent inappropriate developer access.
Where development and test personnel have access to the operational system and its information, they
may be able to introduce unauthorized and untested code or alter operational data. On some systems
this capability could be misused to commit fraud, or introduce untested or malicious code, which can
cause serious operational problems.
Developers and testers also pose a threat to the confidentiality of operational information.
Development and testing activities may cause unintended changes to software or information if they
share the same computing environment. Separating development, test, and operational facilities is
therefore desirable to reduce the risk of accidental change or unauthorized access to operational
software and business data (see also 12.4.2 for the protection of test data).

10.2

Third party service delivery management

Objective: To implement and maintain the appropriate level of information security and service
delivery in line with third party service delivery agreements.
The organization should check the implementation of agreements, monitor compliance with the
agreements and manage changes to ensure that the services delivered meet all requirements agreed
with the third party.

10.2.1 Service delivery
Control
It should be ensured that the security controls, service definitions and delivery levels included in the
third party service delivery agreement are implemented, operated, and maintained by the third party.
Implementation guidance
Service delivery by a third party should include the agreed security arrangements, service definitions,
and aspects of service management. In case of outsourcing arrangements, the organization should plan
the necessary transitions (of information, information processing facilities, and anything else that
needs to be moved), and should ensure that security is maintained throughout the transition period.
The organization should ensure that the third party maintains sufficient service capability together
with workable plans designed to ensure that agreed service continuity levels are maintained following
major service failures or disaster (see 14.1).

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)

10.2.2 Monitoring and review of third party services
Control
The services, reports and records provided by the third party should be regularly monitored and
reviewed, and audits should be carried out regularly.
Implementation guidance
Monitoring and review of third party services should ensure that the information security terms and
conditions of the agreements are being adhered to, and that information security incidents and
problems are managed properly. This should involve a service management relationship and process
between the organization and the third party to:
a) monitor service performance levels to check adherence to the agreements;
b) review service reports produced by the third party and arrange regular progress meetings
as required by the agreements;
c) provide information about information security incidents and review of this information
by the third party and the organization as required by the agreements and any supporting
guidelines and procedures;
d) review third party audit trails and records of security events, operational problems,
failures, tracing of faults and disruptions related to the service delivered;
e) resolve and manage any identified problems.
The responsibility for managing the relationship with a third party should be assigned to a designated
individual or service management team. In addition, the organization should ensure that the third
party assigns responsibilities for checking for compliance and enforcing the requirements of the
agreements. Sufficient technical skills and resources should be made available to monitor that
requirements of the agreement (see 6.2.3), in particular the information security requirements, are
being met. Appropriate action should be taken when deficiencies in the service delivery are observed.
The organization should maintain sufficient overall control and visibility into all security aspects for
sensitive or critical information or information processing facilities accessed, processed or managed
by a third party. The organization should ensure they retain visibility into security activities such as
change management, identification of vulnerabilities, and information security incident
reporting/response through a clearly defined reporting process, format and structure.
Other information
In case of outsourcing, the organization needs to be aware that the ultimate responsibility for
information processed by an outsourcing party remains with the organization.

10.2.3 Managing changes to third party services
Control
Changes to the provision of services, including maintaining and improving existing information
security policies, procedures and controls, should be managed, taking account of the criticality of
business systems and processes involved and re-assessment of risks.
Implementation guidance
The process of managing changes to a third party service needs to take account of:
a) changes made by the organization to implement:
1) enhancements to the current services offered;
2) development of any new applications and systems;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
3) modifications or updates of the organization’s policies and procedures;
4) new controls to resolve information security incidents and to improve security;
b) changes in third party services to implement:
1) changes and enhancement to networks;
2) use of new technologies;
3) adoption of new products or newer versions/releases;
4) new development tools and environments;
5) changes to physical location of service facilities;
6) change of vendors.

10.3

System planning and acceptance

Objective: To minimize the risk of systems failures.
Advance planning and preparation are required to ensure the availability of adequate capacity and
resources to deliver the required system performance.
Projections of future capacity requirements should be made, to reduce the risk of system overload.
The operational requirements of new systems should be established, documented, and tested prior to
their acceptance and use.

10.3.1 Capacity management
Control
The use of resources should be monitored, tuned, and projections made of future capacity
requirements to ensure the required system performance.
Implementation guidance
For each new and ongoing activity, capacity requirements should be identified. System tuning and
monitoring should be applied to ensure and, where necessary, improve the availability and efficiency
of systems. Detective controls should be put in place to indicate problems in due time. Projections of
future capacity requirements should take account of new business and system requirements and
current and projected trends in the organization's information processing capabilities.
Particular attention needs to be paid to any resources with long procurement lead times or high costs;
therefore managers should monitor the utilization of key system resources. They should identify
trends in usage, particularly in relation to business applications or management information system
tools.
Managers should use this information to identify and avoid potential bottlenecks and dependence on
key personnel that might present a threat to system security or services, and plan appropriate action.

10.3.2 System acceptance
Control
Acceptance criteria for new information systems, upgrades, and new versions should be established
and suitable tests of the system(s) carried out during development and prior to acceptance.
Implementation guidance
Managers should ensure that the requirements and criteria for acceptance of new systems are clearly
defined, agreed, documented, and tested. New information systems, upgrades, and new versions

should only be migrated into production after obtaining formal acceptance. The following items
should be considered prior to formal acceptance being provided:
a) performance and computer capacity requirements;
b) error recovery and restart procedures, and contingency plans;
c) preparation and testing of routine operating procedures to defined standards;
d) agreed set of security controls in place;
e) effective manual procedures;
f) business continuity arrangements (see 14.1);
g) evidence that installation of the new system will not adversely affect existing systems,
particularly at peak processing times, such as month end;
h) evidence that consideration has been given to the effect the new system has on the overall
security of the organization;
i)

training in the operation or use of new systems;

j)

ease of use, as this affects user performance and avoids human error.

For major new developments, the operations function and users should be consulted at all stages in the
development process to ensure the operational efficiency of the proposed system design. Appropriate
tests should be carried out to confirm that all acceptance criteria have been fully satisfied.
Other information
Acceptance may include a formal certification and accreditation process to verify that the security
requirements have been properly addressed.

10.4

Protection against malicious and mobile code

Objective: To protect the integrity of software and information.
Precautions are required to prevent and detect the introduction of malicious code and unauthorized
mobile code.
Software and information processing facilities are vulnerable to the introduction of malicious code,
such as computer viruses, network worms, Trojan horses, and logic bombs. Users should be made
aware of the dangers of malicious code. Managers should, where appropriate, introduce controls to
prevent, detect, and remove malicious code and control mobile code.

10.4.1 Controls against malicious code
Control
Detection, prevention, and recovery controls to protect against malicious code and appropriate user
awareness procedures should be implemented.
Implementation guidance
Protection against malicious code should be based on malicious code detection and repair software,
security awareness, and appropriate system access and change management controls. The following
guidance should be considered:
a) establishing a formal policy prohibiting the use of unauthorized software (see 15.1.2);
b) establishing a formal policy to protect against risks associated with obtaining files and
software either from or via external networks, or on any other medium, indicating what
protective measures should be taken;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
c) conducting regular reviews of the software and data content of systems supporting critical
business processes; the presence of any unapproved files or unauthorized amendments
should be formally investigated;
d) installation and regular update of malicious code detection and repair software to scan
computers and media as a precautionary control, or on a routine basis; the checks carried
out should include:
1) checking any files on electronic or optical media, and files received over networks,
for malicious code before use;
2) checking electronic mail attachments and downloads for malicious code before use;
this check should be carried out at different places, e.g. at electronic mail servers,
desk top computers and when entering the network of the organization;
3) checking web pages for malicious code;
e) defining management procedures and responsibilities to deal with malicious code
protection on systems, training in their use, reporting and recovering from malicious code
attacks (see 13.1 and 13.2);
f) preparing appropriate business continuity plans for recovering from malicious code
attacks, including all necessary data and software back-up and recovery arrangements (see
clause 14);
g) implementing procedures to regularly collect information, such as subscribing to mailing
lists and/or checking web sites giving information about new malicious code;
h) implementing procedures to verify information relating to malicious code, and ensure that
warning bulletins are accurate and informative; managers should ensure that qualified
sources, e.g. reputable journals, reliable Internet sites or suppliers producing software
protecting against malicious code, are used to differentiate between hoaxes and real
malicious code; all users should be made aware of the problem of hoaxes and what to do
on receipt of them.
Other information
The use of two or more software products protecting against malicious code across the information
processing environment from different vendors can improve the effectiveness of malicious code
protection.
Software to protect against malicious code can be installed to provide automatic updates of definition
files and scanning engines to ensure the protection is up to date. In addition, this software can be
installed on every desktop to carry out automatic checks.
Care should be taken to protect against the introduction of malicious code during maintenance and
emergency procedures, which may bypass normal malicious code protection controls.

10.4.2 Controls against mobile code
Control
Where the use of mobile code is authorized, the configuration should ensure that the authorised
mobile code operates according to a clearly defined security policy, and unauthorized mobile code
should be prevented from executing.
Implementation guidance
The following actions should be considered to protect against mobile code performing unauthorized
actions:
a) executing mobile code in a logically isolated environment;
b) blocking any use of mobile code;

43

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
c) blocking receipt of mobile code;
d) activating technical measures as available on a specific system to ensure mobile code is
managed;
e) control the resources available to mobile code access;
f) cryptographic controls to uniquely authenticate mobile code.
Other information
Mobile code is software code which transfers from one computer to another computer and then
executes automatically and performs a specific function with little or no user interaction. Mobile code
is associated with a number of middleware services.
In addition to ensuring that mobile code does not contain malicious code, control of mobile code is
essential to avoid unauthorised use or disruption of system, network, or application resources and
other breaches of information security.

10.5

Back-up

Objective: To maintain the integrity and availability of information and information processing
facilities.
Routine procedures should be established to implement the agreed back-up policy and strategy (see
also 14.1) for taking back-up copies of data and rehearsing their timely restoration.

10.5.1 Information back-up
Control
Back-up copies of information and software should be taken and tested regularly in accordance with
the agreed backup policy.
Implementation guidance
Adequate back-up facilities should be provided to ensure that all essential information and software
can be recovered following a disaster or media failure.
The following items for information back up should be considered:
a) the necessary level of back-up information should be defined;
b) accurate and complete records of the back-up copies and documented restoration
procedures should be produced;
c) the extent (e.g. full or differential backup) and frequency of backups should reflect the
business requirements of the organization, the security requirements of the information
involved, and the criticality of the information to the continued operation of the
organization;
d) the back-ups should be stored in a remote location, at a sufficient distance to escape any
damage from a disaster at the main site;
e) back-up information should be given an appropriate level of physical and environmental
protection (see clause 9) consistent with the standards applied at the main site; the
controls applied to media at the main site should be extended to cover the back-up site;
f) back-up media should be regularly tested to ensure that they can be relied upon for
emergency use when necessary;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
g) restoration procedures should be regularly checked and tested to ensure that they are
effective and that they can be completed within the time allotted in the operational
procedures for recovery;
h) in situations where confidentiality is of importance, back-ups should be protected by
means of encryption.
Back-up arrangements for individual systems should be regularly tested to ensure that they meet the
requirements of business continuity plans (see clause 14). For critical systems, the backup
arrangements should cover all systems information, applications, and data necessary to recover the
complete system in the event of a disaster.
The retention period for essential business information, and also any requirement for archive copies to
be permanently retained should be determined (see 15.1.3).
Other information
Back up arrangements can be automated to ease the back-up and restore process. Such automated
solutions should be sufficiently tested prior to implementation and at regular intervals.

10.6

Network security management

Objective: To ensure the protection of information in networks and the protection of the supporting
infrastructure.
The secure management of networks, which may span organizational boundaries, requires careful
consideration to dataflow, legal implications, monitoring, and protection.
Additional controls may also be required to protect sensitive information passing over public
networks.

10.6.1 Network controls
Control
Networks should be adequately managed and controlled, in order to be protected from threats, and to
maintain security for the systems and applications using the network, including information in transit.
Implementation guidance
Network managers should implement controls to ensure the security of information in networks, and
the protection of connected services from unauthorized access. In particular, the following items
should be considered:
a) operational responsibility for networks should be separated from computer operations
where appropriate (see 10.1.3);
b) responsibilities and procedures for the management of remote equipment, including
equipment in user areas, should be established;
c) special controls should be established to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of data
passing over public networks or over wireless networks, and to protect the connected
systems and applications (see 11.4 and 12.3); special controls may also be required to
maintain the availability of the network services and computers connected;
d) appropriate logging and monitoring should be applied to enable recording of security
relevant actions;
e) management activities should be closely co-ordinated both to optimize the service to the
organization and to ensure that controls are consistently applied across the information
processing infrastructure.

Other information
Additional information on network security can be found in ISO/IEC 18028, Information technology –
Security techniques – IT network security.

10.6.2 Security of network services
Control
Security features, service levels, and management requirements of all network services should be
identified and included in any network services agreement, whether these services are provided inhouse or outsourced.
Implementation guidance
The ability of the network service provider to manage agreed services in a secure way should be
determined and regularly monitored, and the right to audit should be agreed.
The security arrangements necessary for particular services, such as security features, service levels,
and management requirements, should be identified. The organization should ensure that network
service providers implement these measures.
Other information
Network services include the provision of connections, private network services, and value added
networks and managed network security solutions such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
These services can range from simple unmanaged bandwidth to complex value-added offerings.
Security features of network services could be:
a) technology applied for security of network services, such as authentication, encryption,
and network connection controls;
b) technical parameters required for secured connection with the network services in
accordance with the security and network connection rules;
c) procedures for the network service usage to restrict access to network services or
applications, where necessary.

10.7

Media handling

Objective: To prevent unauthorized disclosure, modification, removal or destruction of assets, and
interruption to business activities.
Media should be controlled and physically protected.
Appropriate operating procedures should be established to protect documents, computer media (e.g.
tapes, disks), input/output data and system documentation from unauthorized disclosure, modification,
removal, and destruction.

10.7.1 Management of removable media
Control
There should be procedures in place for the management of removable media.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines for the management of removable media should be considered:
a) if no longer required, the contents of any re-usable media that are to be removed from the
organization should be made unrecoverable;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
b) where necessary and practical, authorization should be required for media removed from
the organization and a record of such removals should be kept in order to maintain an
audit trail;
c) all media should be stored in a safe, secure environment, in accordance with
manufacturers’ specifications;
d) information stored on media that needs to be available longer than the media lifetime (in
accordance with manufacturers’ specifications) should be also stored elsewhere to avoid
information loss due to media deterioration;
e) registration of removable media should be considered to limit the opportunity for data
loss;
f) removable media drives should only be enabled if there is a business reason for doing so.
All procedures and authorization levels should be clearly documented.
Other information
Removable media include tapes, disks, flash disks, removable hard drives, CDs, DVDs, and printed
media.

10.7.2 Disposal of media
Control
Media should be disposed of securely and safely when no longer required, using formal procedures.
Implementation guidance
Formal procedures for the secure disposal of media should minimize the risk of sensitive information
leakage to unauthorised persons. The procedures for secure disposal of media containing sensitive
information should be commensurate with the sensitivity of that information. The following items
should be considered:
a) media containing sensitive information should be stored and disposed of securely and
safely, e.g. by incineration or shredding, or erased of data for use by another application
within the organization;
b) procedures should be in place to identify the items that might require secure disposal;
c) it may be easier to arrange for all media items to be collected and disposed of securely,
rather than attempting to separate out the sensitive items;
d) many organizations offer collection and disposal services for papers, equipment and
media; care should be taken in selecting a suitable contractor with adequate controls and
experience;
e) disposal of sensitive items should be logged where possible in order to maintain an audit
trail.
When accumulating media for disposal, consideration should be given to the aggregation effect, which
may cause a large quantity of non-sensitive information to become sensitive.
Other information
Sensitive information could be disclosed through careless disposal of media (see also 9.2.6 for
information about disposal of equipment).

10.7.3 Information handling procedures
Control
Procedures for the handling and storage of information should be established to protect this
information from unauthorized disclosure or misuse.

letters, unauthorized purchasing, etc.;
g) use of cryptographic techniques e.g. to protect the confidentiality, integrity and
authenticity of information (see Clause 12.3);
h) retention and disposal guidelines for all business correspondence, including messages, in
accordance with relevant national and local legislation and regulations;
i)

not leaving sensitive or critical information on printing facilities, e.g. copiers, printers,
and facsimile machines, as these may be accessed by unauthorized personnel;

j)

controls and restrictions associated with the forwarding of communication facilities, e.g.
automatic forwarding of electronic mail to external mail addresses;

k) reminding personnel that they should take appropriate precautions, e.g. not to reveal
sensitive information to avoid being overheard or intercepted when making a phone call
by:
1) people in their immediate vicinity particularly when using mobile phones;
2) wiretapping, and other forms of eavesdropping through physical access to the phone
handset or the phone line, or using scanning receivers;
3) people at the recipient’s end;
l)

not leaving messages containing sensitive information on answering machines since these
may be replayed by unauthorized persons, stored on communal systems or stored
incorrectly as a result of misdialling;

m) reminding personnel about the problems of using facsimile machines, namely:
1) unauthorized access to built-in message stores to retrieve messages;
2) deliberate or accidental programming of machines to send messages to specific
numbers;
3) sending documents and messages to the wrong number either by misdialling or using
the wrong stored number;

personal information, in any software to avoid collection for unauthorized use;
o) reminding personnel that modern facsimile machines and photocopiers have page caches
and store pages in case of a paper or transmission fault, which will be printed once the
fault is cleared.
In addition, personnel should be reminded that they should not have confidential conversations in
public places or open offices and meeting places with non-sound proofed-walls.
Information exchange facilities should comply with any relevant legal requirements (see clause 15).
Other Information
Information exchange may occur through the use of a number of different types of communication
facilities, including electronic mail, voice, facsimile, and video.
Software exchange may occur through a number of different mediums, including downloading from
the Internet and acquired from vendors selling off-the-shelf products.
The business, legal, and security implications associated with electronic data interchange, electronic
commerce, and electronic communications and the requirements for controls should be considered.
Information could be compromised due to lack of awareness, policy or procedures on the use of
information exchange facilities, e.g. being overheard on a mobile phone in a public place, misdirection
of an electronic mail message, answering machines being overheard, unauthorised access to dial-in
voice-mail systems or accidentally sending facsimiles to the wrong facsimile equipment.
Business operations could be disrupted and information could be compromised if communications
facilities fail, are overloaded or interrupted (see 10.3 and clause 14). Information could be
compromised if accessed by unauthorized users (see clause 11).

10.8.2 Exchange agreements
Control
Agreements should be established for the exchange of information and software between the
organization and external parties.
Implementation guidance
Exchange agreements should consider the following security conditions:
a) management responsibilities for controlling and notifying transmission, dispatch, and
receipt;
b) procedures for notifying sender of transmission, dispatch, and receipt;
c) procedures to ensure traceability and non-repudiation;
d) minimum technical standards for packaging and transmission;
e) escrow agreements;
f) courier identification standards;
g) responsibilities and liabilities in the event of information security incidents, such as loss
of data;
h) use of an agreed labelling system for sensitive or critical information, ensuring that the
meaning of the labels is immediately understood and that the information is appropriately
protected;

ownership and responsibilities for data protection, copyright, software license compliance
and similar considerations (see 15.1.2 and 15.1.4);

j)

technical standards for recording and reading information and software;

k) any special controls that may be required to protect sensitive items, such as cryptographic
keys (see 12.3).
Policies, procedures, and standards should be established and maintained to protect information and
physical media in transit (see also 10.8.3), and should be referenced in such exchange agreements.
The security content of any agreement should reflect the sensitivity of the business information
involved.
Other Information
Agreements may be electronic or manual, and may take the form of formal contracts or conditions of
employment. For sensitive information, the specific mechanisms used for the exchange of such
information should be consistent for all organizations and types of agreements.

10.8.3 Physical media in transit
Control
Media containing information should be protected against unauthorized access, misuse or corruption
during transportation beyond an organization’s physical boundaries.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered to protect information media being transported
between sites:
a) reliable transport or couriers should be used;
b) a list of authorized couriers should be agreed with management;
c) procedures to check the identification of couriers should be developed;
d) packaging should be sufficient to protect the contents from any physical damage likely to
arise during transit and in accordance with any manufacturers’ specifications (e.g. for
software), for example protecting against any environmental factors that may reduce the
media’s restoration effectiveness such as exposure to heat, moisture or electromagnetic
fields;
e) controls should be adopted, where necessary, to protect sensitive information from
unauthorized disclosure or modification; examples include:
1) use of locked containers;
2) delivery by hand;
3) tamper-evident packaging (which reveals any attempt to gain access);
4) in exceptional cases, splitting of the consignment into more than one delivery and
dispatch by different routes.
Other Information
Information can be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse or corruption during physical transport,
for instance when sending media via the postal service or via courier.

10.8.4 Electronic messaging
Control
Information involved in electronic messaging should be appropriately protected.
Implementation guidance
Security considerations for electronic messaging should include the following:
a) protecting messages from unauthorized access, modification or denial of service;
b) ensuring correct addressing and transportation of the message;
c) general reliability and availability of the service;
d) legal considerations, for example requirements for electronic signatures;
e) obtaining approval prior to using external public services such as instant messaging or file
sharing;
f) stronger levels of authentication controlling access from publicly accessible networks.
Other Information
Electronic messaging such as email, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and instant messaging play an
increasingly important role in business communications. Electronic messaging has different risks
than paper based communications.

10.8.5 Business information systems
Control
Policies and procedures should be developed and implemented to protect information associated with
the interconnection of business information systems.
Implementation guidance
Consideration given to the security and business implications of interconnecting such facilities should
include:
a) known vulnerabilities in the administrative and accounting systems where information is
shared between different parts of the organization;
b) vulnerabilities of information in business communication systems, e.g. recording phone
calls or conference calls, confidentiality of calls, storage of facsimiles, opening mail,
distribution of mail;
c) policy and appropriate controls to manage information sharing;
d) excluding categories of sensitive business information and classified documents if the
system does not provide an appropriate level of protection (see 7.2);
e) restricting access to diary information relating to selected individuals, e.g. personnel
working on sensitive projects;
f) categories of personnel, contractors or business partners allowed to use the system and the
locations from which it may be accessed (see 6.2 and 6.3);
g) restricting selected facilities to specific categories of user;
h) identifying the status of users, e.g. employees of the organization or contractors in
directories for the benefit of other users;
i)

retention and back-up of information held on the system (see 10.5.1);

j)

fallback requirements and arrangements (see 14).

information using a combination of: documents, computers, mobile computing, mobile
communications, mail, voice mail, voice communications in general, multimedia, postal
services/facilities and facsimile machines.

10.9

Electronic commerce services

Objective: To ensure the security of electronic commerce services, and their secure use.
The security implications associated with using electronic commerce services, including on-line
transactions, and the requirements for controls, should be considered. The integrity and availability of
information electronically published through publicly available systems should also be considered.

10.9.1 Electronic commerce
Control
Information involved in electronic commerce passing over public networks should be protected from
fraudulent activity, contract dispute, and unauthorized disclosure and modification.
Implementation guidance
Security considerations for electronic commerce should include the following:
a) the level of confidence each party requires in each others claimed identity, e.g. through
authentication;
b) authorization processes associated with who may set prices, issue or sign key trading
documents;
c) ensuring that trading partners are fully informed of their authorisations;
d) determining and meeting requirements for confidentiality, integrity, proof of dispatch and
receipt of key documents, and the non-repudiation of contracts, e.g. associated with
tendering and contract processes;
e) the level of trust required in the integrity of advertised price lists;
f) the confidentiality of any sensitive data or information;
g) the confidentiality and integrity of any order transactions, payment information, delivery
address details, and confirmation of receipts;
h) the degree of verification appropriate to check payment information supplied by a
customer;
i)

selecting the most appropriate settlement form of payment to guard against fraud;

j)

the level of protection required to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of order
information;

k) avoidance of loss or duplication of transaction information;
l)

liability associated with any fraudulent transactions;

m) insurance requirements.
Many of the above considerations can be addressed by the application of cryptographic controls (see
12.3), taking into account compliance with legal requirements (see 15.1, especially 15.1.6 for
cryptography legislation).
Electronic commerce arrangements between trading partners should be supported by a documented
agreement which commits both parties to the agreed terms of trading, including details of
authorization (see b) above). Other agreements with information service and value added network
providers may be necessary.

53

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Public trading systems should publicize their terms of business to customers.
Consideration should be given to the resilience to attack of the host(s) used for electronic commerce,
and the security implications of any network interconnection required for the implementation of
electronic commerce services (see 11.4.6).
Other Information
Electronic commerce is vulnerable to a number of network threats that may result in fraudulent
activity, contract dispute, and disclosure or modification of information.
Electronic commerce can make use of secure authentication methods, e.g. using public key
cryptography and digital signatures (see also 12.3) to reduce the risks. Also, trusted third parties can
be used, where such services are needed.

10.9.2 On-Line Transactions
Control
Information involved in on-line transactions should be protected to prevent incomplete transmission,
mis-routing, unauthorized message alteration, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized message
duplication or replay.
Implementation guidance
Security considerations for on-line transactions should include the following:
a) the use of electronic signatures by each of the parties involved in the transaction;
b) all aspects of the transaction, i.e. ensuring that:
1) user credentials of all parties are valid and verified;
2) the transaction remains confidential; and
3) privacy associated with all parties involved is retained;
c) communications path between all involved parties is encrypted;
d) protocols used to communicate between all involved parties is secured;
e) ensuring that the storage of the transaction details are located outside of any public
accessible environment, e.g. on a storage platform existing on the organizational Intranet,
and not retained and exposed on a storage medium directly accessible from the Internet;
f) where a trusted authority is used (e.g. for the purposes of issuing and maintaining digital
signatures and/or digital certificates) security is integrated and embedded throughout the
entire end-to-end certificate/signature management process.
Other Information
The extent of the controls adopted will need to be commensurate with the level of the risk associated
with each form of on-line transaction.
Transactions may need to comply with laws, rules, and regulations in the jurisdiction in which the
transaction is generated from, processed via, completed at, and/or stored.
There exist many forms of transactions that can be performed in an on-line manner e.g. contractual,
financial etc.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)

10.9.3 Publicly available information
Control
The integrity of information being made available on a publicly available system should be protected
to prevent unauthorized modification.
Implementation guidance
Software, data, and other information requiring a high level of integrity, being made available on a
publicly available system, should be protected by appropriate mechanisms, e.g. digital signatures (see
12.3). The publicly accessible system should be tested against weaknesses and failures prior to
information being made available.
There should be a formal approval process before information is made publicly available. In addition,
all input provided from the outside to the system should be verified and approved.
Electronic publishing systems, especially those that permit feedback and direct entering of
information, should be carefully controlled so that:
a) information is obtained in compliance with any data protection legislation (see 15.1.4);
b) information input to, and processed by, the publishing system will be processed
completely and accurately in a timely manner;
c) sensitive information will be protected during collection, processing, and storage;
d) access to the publishing system does not allow unintended access to networks to which
the system is connected.
Other Information
Information on a publicly available system, e.g. information on a Web server accessible via the
Internet, may need to comply with laws, rules, and regulations in the jurisdiction in which the system
is located, where trade is taking place or where the owner(s) reside. Unauthorized modification of
published information may harm the reputation of the publishing organization.

10.10 Monitoring
Objective: To detect unauthorized information processing activities.
Systems should be monitored and information security events should be recorded. Operator logs and
fault logging should be used to ensure information system problems are identified.
An organization should comply with all relevant legal requirements applicable to its monitoring and
logging activities.
System monitoring should be used to check the effectiveness of controls adopted and to verify
conformity to an access policy model.

10.10.1 Audit logging
Control
Audit logs recording user activities, exceptions, and information security events should be produced
and kept for an agreed period to assist in future investigations and access control monitoring.
Implementation guidance
Audit logs should include, when relevant:
a) user IDs;
b) dates, times, and details of key events, e.g. log-on and log-off;

55

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
c) terminal identity or location if possible;
d) records of successful and rejected system access attempts;
e) records of successful and rejected data and other resource access attempts;
f) changes to system configuration;
g) use of privileges;
h) use of system utilities and applications;
i)

files accessed and the kind of access;

j)

network addresses and protocols;

k) alarms raised by the access control system;
l)

activation and de-activation of protection systems, such as anti-virus systems and
intrusion detection systems.

Other information
The audit logs may contain intrusive and confidential personal data. Appropriate privacy protection
measures should be taken (see also 15.1.4). Where possible, system administrators should not have
permission to erase or de-activate logs of their own activities (see 10.1.3).

10.10.2 Monitoring system use
Control
Procedures for monitoring use of information processing facilities should be established and the
results of the monitoring activities reviewed regularly.
Implementation guidance
The level of monitoring required for individual facilities should be determined by a risk assessment.
An organisation should comply with all relevant legal requirements applicable to its monitoring
activities. Areas that should be considered include:
a) authorized access, including detail such as:
1) the user ID;
2) the date and time of key events;
3) the types of events;
4) the files accessed;
5) the program/utilities used;
b) all privileged operations, such as:
1) use of privileged accounts, e.g. supervisor, root, administrator;
2) system start-up and stop;
3) I/O device attachment/detachment;
c) unauthorized access attempts, such as:
1) failed or rejected user actions;
2) failed or rejected actions involving data and other resources;
3) access policy violations and notifications for network gateways and firewalls;
4) alerts from proprietary intrusion detection systems;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
d) system alerts or failures such as:
1) console alerts or messages;
2) system log exceptions;
3) network management alarms;
4) alarms raised by the access control system;
e) changes to, or attempts to change, system security settings and controls.
How often the results of monitoring activities are reviewed should depend on the risks involved. Risk
factors that should be considered include the:
a) criticality of the application processes;
b) value, sensitivity, and criticality of the information involved;
c) past experience of system infiltration and misuse, and the frequency of vulnerabilities
being exploited;
d) extent of system interconnection (particularly public networks);
e) logging facility being de-activated.
Other information
Usage monitoring procedures are necessary to ensure that users are only performing activities that
have been explicitly authorized.
A log review involves understanding the threats faced by the system and the manner in which these
may arise. Examples of events that might require further investigation in case of information security
incidents are given in 13.1.1.

10.10.3 Protection of log information
Control
Logging facilities and log information should be protected against tampering and unauthorized access.
Implementation guidance
Controls should aim to protect against unauthorized changes and operational problems with the
logging facility including:
a) alterations to the message types that are recorded;
b) log files being edited or deleted;
c) storage capacity of the log file media being exceeded, resulting in either the failure to
record events or over-writing of past recorded events.
Some audit logs may be required to be archived as part of the record retention policy or because of
requirements to collect and retain evidence (see also 13.2.3).
Other information
System logs often contain a large volume of information, much of which is extraneous to security
monitoring. To help identify significant events for security monitoring purposes, the copying of
appropriate message types automatically to a second log, and/or the use of suitable system utilities or
audit tools to perform file interrogation and rationalization should be considered.
System logs need to be protected, because if the data can be modified or data in them deleted, their
existence may create a false sense of security.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)

10.10.4 Administrator and operator logs
Control
System administrator and system operator activities should be logged.
Implementation guidance
Logs should include:
a) the time at which an event (success or failure) occurred;
b) information about the event (e.g. files handled) or failure (e.g. error occurred and
corrective action taken);
c) which account and which administrator or operator was involved;
d) which processes were involved.
System administrator and operator logs should be reviewed on a regular basis.
Other information
An intrusion detection system managed outside of the control of system and network administrators
can be used to monitor system and network administration activities for compliance.

10.10.5 Fault logging
Control
Faults should be logged, analysed, and appropriate action taken.
Implementation guidance
Faults reported by users or by system programs related to problems with information processing or
communications systems should be logged. There should be clear rules for handling reported faults
including:
a) review of fault logs to ensure that faults have been satisfactorily resolved;
b) review of corrective measures to ensure that controls have not been compromised, and
that the action taken is fully authorized.
It should be ensured that error logging is enabled, if this system function is available.
Other information
Logging of errors and faults can impact the performance of a system. Such logging should be enabled
by competent personnel, and the level of logging required for individual systems should be
determined by a risk assessment, taking performance degradation into account.

10.10.6 Clock synchronization
Control
The clocks of all relevant information processing systems within an organization or security domain
should be synchronized with an agreed accurate time source.
Implementation guidance
Where a computer or communications device has the capability to operate a real-time clock, this clock
should be set to an agreed standard, e.g. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or local standard time. As
some clocks are known to drift with time, there should be a procedure that checks for and corrects any
significant variation.
The correct interpretation of the date/time format is important to ensure that the timestamp reflects the
real date/time. Local specifics (e.g. daylight savings) should be taken into account.

Other information
The correct setting of computer clocks is important to ensure the accuracy of audit logs, which may be
required for investigations or as evidence in legal or disciplinary cases. Inaccurate audit logs may
hinder such investigations and damage the credibility of such evidence. A clock linked to a radio time
broadcast from a national atomic clock can be used as the master clock for logging systems. A
network time protocol can be used to keep all of the servers in synchronisation with the master clock.

Access control

11.1

Business requirement for access control

Objective: To control access to information.
Access to information, information processing facilities, and business processes should be controlled
on the basis of business and security requirements.
Access control rules should take account of policies for information dissemination and authorization.

11.1.1 Access control policy
Control
An access control policy should be established, documented, and reviewed based on business and
security requirements for access.
Implementation guidance
Access control rules and rights for each user or group of users should be clearly stated in an access
control policy. Access controls are both logical and physical (see also section 9) and these should be
considered together. Users and service providers should be given a clear statement of the business
requirements to be met by access controls.
The policy should take account of the following:
a) security requirements of individual business applications;
b) identification of all information related to the business applications and the risks the
information is facing;
c) policies for information dissemination and authorization, e.g. the need to know principle
and security levels and classification of information (see 7.2);
d) consistency between the access control and information classification policies of different
systems and networks;
e) relevant legislation and any contractual obligations regarding protection of access to data
or services (see 15.1);
f) standard user access profiles for common job roles in the organization;
g) management of access rights in a distributed and networked environment which
recognizes all types of connections available;
h) segregation of access control roles, e.g. access request, access authorization, access
administration;
i)

requirements for formal authorization of access requests (see 11.2.1);

j)

requirements for periodic review of access controls (see 11.2.4);

k) removal of access rights (see 8.3.3).
Other information
Care should be taken when specifying access control rules to consider:
a) differentiating between rules that must always be enforced and guidelines that are
optional or conditional;

Licensed to Mr. PEDDINTI

60

© ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
b) establishing rules based on the premise “Everything is generally forbidden unless
expressly permitted” rather than the weaker rule “Everything is generally permitted unless
expressly forbidden”;
c) changes in information labels (see 7.2) that are initiated automatically by information
processing facilities and those initiated at the discretion of a user;
d) changes in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the information system and
those initiated by an administrator;
e) rules, which require specific approval before enactment, and those which do not.
Access control rules should be supported by formal procedures and clearly defined responsibilities
(see, for example, 6.1.3, 11.3, 10.4.1, 11.6).

11.2

User access management

Objective: To ensure authorized user access and to prevent unauthorized access to information
systems.
Formal procedures should be in place to control the allocation of access rights to information systems
and services.
The procedures should cover all stages in the life-cycle of user access, from the initial registration of
new users to the final de-registration of users who no longer require access to information systems and
services. Special attention should be given, where appropriate, to the need to control the allocation of
privileged access rights, which allow users to override system controls.

11.2.1 User registration
Control
There should be a formal user registration and de-registration procedure in place for granting and
revoking access to all information systems and services.
Implementation guidance
The access control procedure for user registration and de-registration should include:
a) using unique user IDs to enable users to be linked to and held responsible for their
actions; the use of group IDs should only be permitted where they are necessary for
business or operational reasons, and should be approved and documented;
b) checking that the user has authorization from the system owner for the use of the
information system or service; separate approval for access rights from management may
also be appropriate;
c) checking that the level of access granted is appropriate to the business purpose (see 11.1)
and is consistent with organizational security policy, e.g. it does not compromise
segregation of duties (see 10.1.3);
d) giving users a written statement of their access rights;
e) requiring users to sign statements indicating that they understand the conditions of access;
f) ensuring service providers do not provide access until authorization procedures have been
completed;
g) maintaining a formal record of all persons registered to use the service;
h) immediately removing or blocking access rights of users who have changed roles or jobs
or left the organization;
i)

periodically checking for, and removing or blocking, redundant user IDs and accounts
(see 11.2.4);

j)

ensuring that redundant user IDs are not issued to other users.

61

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Other information
Consideration should be given to establish user access roles based on business requirements that
summarize a number of access rights into typical user access profiles. Access requests and reviews
(see 11.2.4) are easier managed at the level of such roles than at the level of particular rights.
Consideration should be given to including clauses in personnel contracts and service contracts that
specify sanctions if unauthorized access is attempted by personnel or service agents (see also 6.1.5,
8.1.3 and 8.2.3).

11.2.2 Privilege management
Control
The allocation and use of privileges should be restricted and controlled.
Implementation guidance
Multi-user systems that require protection against unauthorized access should have the allocation of
privileges controlled through a formal authorization process. The following steps should be
considered:
a) the access privileges associated with each system product, e.g. operating system, database
management system and each application, and the users to which they need to be
allocated should be identified;
b) privileges should be allocated to users on a need-to-use basis and on an event-by-event
basis in line with the access control policy (11.1.1), i.e. the minimum requirement for
their functional role only when needed;
c) an authorization process and a record of all privileges allocated should be maintained.
Privileges should not be granted until the authorization process is complete;
d) the development and use of system routines should be promoted to avoid the need to grant
privileges to users;
e) the development and use of programs which avoid the need to run with privileges should
be promoted;
f) privileges should be assigned to a different user ID from those used for normal business
use.
Other information
Inappropriate use of system administration privileges (any feature or facility of an information system
that enables the user to override system or application controls) can be a major contributory factor to
the failures or breaches of systems.

11.2.3 User password management
Control
The allocation of passwords should be controlled through a formal management process.
Implementation guidance
The process should include the following requirements:
a) users should be required to sign a statement to keep personal passwords confidential and
to keep group passwords solely within the members of the group; this signed statement
could be included in the terms and conditions of employment (see 8.1.3);

62

© ISO/IEC 2005 – All rights reserved

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
b) when users are required to maintain their own passwords they should be provided initially
with a secure temporary password (see 11.3.1), which they are forced to change
immediately;
c) establish procedures to verify the identity of a user prior to providing a new, replacement
or temporary password;
d) temporary passwords should be given to users in a secure manner; the use of third parties
or unprotected (clear text) electronic mail messages should be avoided;
e) temporary passwords should be unique to an individual and should not be guessable;
f) users should acknowledge receipt of passwords;
g) passwords should never be stored on computer systems in an unprotected form;
h) default vendor passwords should be altered following installation of systems or software.
Other information
Passwords are a common means of verifying a user’s identity before access is given to an information
system or service according to the user’s authorization. Other technologies for user identification and
authentication, such as biometrics, e.g. finger-print verification, signature verification, and use of
hardware tokens, e.g. smart cards, are available, and should be considered if appropriate.

11.2.4 Review of user access rights
Control
Management should review users’ access rights at regular intervals using a formal process.
Implementation guidance
The review of access rights should consider the following guidelines:
a) users’ access rights should be reviewed at regular intervals, e.g. a period of 6 months, and
after any changes, such as promotion, demotion, or termination of employment (see
11.2.1);
b) user access rights should be reviewed and re-allocated when moving from one
employment to another within the same organization;
c) authorizations for special privileged access rights (see 11.2.2) should be reviewed at more
frequent intervals, e.g. at a period of 3 months;
d) privilege allocations should be checked at regular intervals to ensure that unauthorized
privileges have not been obtained;
e) changes to privileged accounts should be logged for periodic review.
Other information
It is necessary to regularly review users’ access rights to maintain effective control over access to data
and information services.

11.3

User responsibilities

Objective: To prevent unauthorized user access, and compromise or theft of information and
information processing facilities.
The co-operation of authorized users is essential for effective security.
Users should be made aware of their responsibilities for maintaining effective access controls,
particularly regarding the use of passwords and the security of user equipment.
A clear desk and clear screen policy should be implemented to reduce the risk of unauthorized access
or damage to papers, media, and information processing facilities.

11.3.1 Password use
Control
Users should be required to follow good security practices in the selection and use of passwords.
Implementation guidance
All users should be advised to:
a) keep passwords confidential;
b) avoid keeping a record (e.g. paper, software file or hand-held device) of passwords, unless
this can be stored securely and the method of storing has been approved;
c) change passwords whenever there is any indication of possible system or password
compromise;
d) select quality passwords with sufficient minimum length which are:
1) easy to remember;
2) not based on anything somebody else could easily guess or obtain using person
related information, e.g. names, telephone numbers, and dates of birth etc.;
3) not vulnerable to dictionary attacks (i.e. do not consist of words included in
dictionaries);
4) free of consecutive identical, all-numeric or all-alphabetic characters;
e) change passwords at regular intervals or based on the number of accesses (passwords for
privileged accounts should be changed more frequently than normal passwords), and
avoid re-using or cycling old passwords;
f) change temporary passwords at the first log-on;
g) not include passwords in any automated log-on process, e.g. stored in a macro or function
key;
h) not share individual user passwords;
i)

not use the same password for business and non-business purposes.

If users need to access multiple services, systems or platforms, and are required to maintain multiple
separate passwords, they should be advised that they may use a single, quality password (see d)
above) for all services where the user is assured that a reasonable level of protection has been
established for the storage of the password within each service, system or platform.
Other information
Management of the help desk system dealing with lost or forgotten passwords needs special care as
this may also be a means of attack to the password system.

11.3.2 Unattended user equipment
Control
Users should ensure that unattended equipment has appropriate protection.
Implementation guidance
All users should be made aware of the security requirements and procedures for protecting unattended
equipment, as well as their responsibilities for implementing such protection. Users should be advised
to:
a) terminate active sessions when finished, unless they can be secured by an appropriate
locking mechanism, e.g. a password protected screen saver;
b) log-off mainframe computers, servers, and office PCs when the session is finished (i.e.
not just switch off the PC screen or terminal);

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
c) secure PCs or terminals from unauthorized use by a key lock or an equivalent control, e.g.
password access, when not in use (see also 11.3.3).
Other information
Equipment installed in user areas, e.g. workstations or file servers, may require specific protection
from unauthorized access when left unattended for an extended period.

11.3.3 Clear desk and clear screen policy
Control
A clear desk policy for papers and removable storage media and a clear screen policy for information
processing facilities should be adopted.
Implementation guidance
The clear desk and clear screen policy should take into account the information classifications (see
7.2), legal and contractual requirements (see 15.1), and the corresponding risks and cultural aspects of
the organization. The following guidelines should be considered:
a) sensitive or critical business information, e.g. on paper or on electronic storage media,
should be locked away (ideally in a safe or cabinet or other forms of security furniture)
when not required, especially when the office is vacated;
b) computers and terminals should be left logged off or protected with a screen and keyboard
locking mechanism controlled by a password, token or similar user authentication
mechanism when unattended and should be protected by key locks, passwords or other
controls when not in use;
c) incoming and outgoing mail points and unattended facsimile machines should be
protected;
d) unauthorised use of photocopiers and other reproduction technology (e.g., scanners,
digital cameras) should be prevented;
e) documents containing sensitive or classified information should be removed from printers
immediately.
Other information
A clear desk/clear screen policy reduces the risks of unauthorized access, loss of, and damage to
information during and outside normal working hours. Safes or other forms of secure storage
facilities might also protect information stored therein against disasters such as a fire, earthquake,
flood or explosion.
Consider the use of printers with pin code function, so the originators are the only ones who can get
their print outs, and only when standing next to the printer.

11.4

Network access control

Objective: To prevent unauthorized access to networked services.
Access to both internal and external networked services should be controlled.
User access to networks and network services should not compromise the security of the network
services by ensuring:
a) appropriate interfaces are in place between the organization’s network and networks owned by
other organizations, and public networks;
b) appropriate authentication mechanisms are applied for users and equipment;
c) control of user access to information services in enforced.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)

11.4.1 Policy on use of network services
Control
Users should only be provided with access to the services that they have been specifically authorized
to use.
Implementation guidance
A policy should be formulated concerning the use of networks and network services. This policy
should cover:
a) the networks and network services which are allowed to be accessed;
b) authorization procedures for determining who is allowed to access which networks and
networked services;
c) management controls and procedures to protect access to network connections and
network services;
d) the means used to access networks and network services (e.g. the conditions for allowing
dial-up access to an Internet service provider or remote system).
The policy on the use of network services should be consistent with the business access control policy
(see 11.1).
Other information
Unauthorized and insecure connections to network services can affect the whole organization. This
control is particularly important for network connections to sensitive or critical business applications
or to users in high-risk locations, e.g. public or external areas that are outside the organization’s
security management and control.

11.4.2 User authentication for external connections
Control
Appropriate authentication methods should be used to control access by remote users.
Implementation guidance
Authentication of remote users can be achieved using, for example, a cryptographic based technique,
hardware tokens, or a challenge/response protocol. Possible implementations of such techniques can
be found in various virtual private network (VPN) solutions. Dedicated private lines can also be used
to provide assurance of the source of connections.
Dial-back procedures and controls, e.g. using dial-back modems, can provide protection against
unauthorized and unwanted connections to an organization’s information processing facilities. This
type of control authenticates users trying to establish a connection to an organization’s network from
remote locations. When using this control, an organization should not use network services, which
include call forwarding, or, if they do, they should disable the use of such features to avoid
weaknesses associated with call forwarding. The call back process should ensure that an actual
disconnection on the organization’s side occurs. Otherwise, the remote user could hold the line open
pretending that the call back verification has occurred. Call back procedures and controls should be
thoroughly tested for this possibility.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Node authentication can serve as an alternative means of authenticating groups of remote users where
they are connected to a secure, shared computer facility. Cryptographic techniques, e.g. based on
machine certificates, can be used for node authentication. This is part of several VPN based solutions.
Additional authentication controls should be implemented to control access to wireless networks. In
particular, special care is needed in the selection of controls for wireless networks due to the greater
opportunities for undetected interception and insertion of network traffic.
Other information
External connections provide a potential for unauthorized access to business information, e.g. access
by dial-up methods. There are different types of authentication method, some of these provide a
greater level of protection than others, e.g. methods based on the use of cryptographic techniques can
provide strong authentication. It is important to determine from a risk assessment the level of
protection required. This is needed for the appropriate selection of an authentication method.
A facility for automatic connection to a remote computer could provide a way of gaining unauthorized
access to a business application. This is especially important if the connection uses a network that is
outside the control of the organization’s security management.

11.4.3 Equipment identification in networks
Control
Automatic equipment identification should be considered as a means to authenticate connections from
specific locations and equipment.
Implementation guidance
Equipment identification can be used if it is important that the communication can only be initiated
from a specific location or equipment. An identifier in or attached to, the equipment can be used to
indicate whether this equipment is permitted to connect to the network. These identifiers should
clearly indicate to which network the equipment is permitted to connect, if more than one network
exists and particularly if these networks are of differing sensitivity. It may be necessary to consider
physical protection of the equipment to maintain the security of the equipment identifier.
Other information
This control can be complemented with other techniques to authenticate the equipment’s user (see
11.4.2). Equipment identification can be applied additionally to user authentication.

11.4.4 Remote diagnostic and configuration port protection
Control
Physical and logical access to diagnostic and configuration ports should be controlled.
Implementation guidance
Potential controls for the access to diagnostic and configuration ports include the use of a key lock and
supporting procedures to control physical access to the port. An example for such a supporting
procedure is to ensure that diagnostic and configuration ports are only accessible by arrangement
between the manager of the computer service and the hardware/software support personnel requiring
access.
Ports, services, and similar facilities installed on a computer or network facility, which are not
specifically required for business functionality, should be disabled or removed.
Other information
Many computer systems, network systems, and communication systems are installed with a remote
diagnostic or configuration facility for use by maintenance engineers. If unprotected, these diagnostic
ports provide a means of unauthorized access.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)

11.4.5 Segregation in networks
Control
Groups of information services, users, and information systems should be segregated on networks.
Implementation guidance
One method of controlling the security of large networks is to divide them into separate logical
network domains, e.g. an organization’s internal network domains and external network domains,
each protected by a defined security perimeter. A graduated set of controls can be applied in different
logical network domains to further segregate the network security environments, e.g. publicly
accessible systems, internal networks, and critical assets. The domains should be defined based on a
risk assessment and the different security requirements within each of the domains.
Such a network perimeter can be implemented by installing a secure gateway between the two
networks to be interconnected to control access and information flow between the two domains. This
gateway should be configured to filter traffic between these domains (see 11.4.6 and 11.4.7) and to
block unauthorized access in accordance with the organization’s access control policy (see 11.1). An
example of this type of gateway is what is commonly referred to as a firewall. Another method of
segregating separate logical domains is to restrict network access by using virtual private networks for
user groups within the organization.
Networks can also be segregated using the network device functionality, e.g. IP switching. Separate
domains can then be implemented by controlling the network data flows using the routing/switching
capabilities, such as access control lists.
The criteria for segregation of networks into domains should be based on the access control policy and
access requirements (see 10.1), and also take account of the relative cost and performance impact of
incorporating suitable network routing or gateway technology (see 11.4.6 and 11.4.7).
In addition, segregation of networks should be based on the value and classification of information
stored or processed in the network, levels of trust, or lines of business, in order to reduce the total
impact of a service disruption.
Consideration should be given to the segregation of wireless networks from internal and private
networks. As the perimeters of wireless networks are not well defined, a risk assessment should be
carried out in such cases to identify controls (e.g. strong authentication, cryptographic methods, and
frequency selection) to maintain network segregation.
Other information
Networks are increasingly being extended beyond traditional organizational boundaries, as business
partnerships are formed that may require the interconnection or sharing of information processing and
networking facilities. Such extensions might increase the risk of unauthorized access to existing
information systems that use the network, some of which may require protection from other network
users because of their sensitivity or criticality.

11.4.6 Network connection control
Control
For shared networks, especially those extending across the organization’s boundaries, the capability of
users to connect to the network should be restricted, in line with the access control policy and
requirements of the business applications (see 11.1).
Implementation guidance
The network access rights of users should be maintained and updated as required by the access control
policy (see 11.1.1).

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
The connection capability of users can be restricted through network gateways that filter traffic by
means of pre-defined tables or rules. Examples of applications to which restrictions should be applied
are:
a) messaging, e.g. electronic mail;
b) file transfer;
c) interactive access;
d) application access.
Linking network access rights to certain times of day or dates should be considered.
Other information
The incorporation of controls to restrict the connection capability of the users may be required by the
access control policy for shared networks, especially those extending across organizational boundaries.

11.4.7 Network routing control
Control
Routing controls should be implemented for networks to ensure that computer connections and
information flows do not breach the access control policy of the business applications.
Implementation guidance
Routing controls should be based on positive source and destination address checking mechanisms.
Security gateways can be used to validate source and destination addresses at internal and external
network control points if proxy and/or network address translation technologies are employed.
Implementers should be aware of the strength and shortcomings of any mechanisms deployed. The
requirements for network routing control should be based on the access control policy (see 11.1).
Other information
Shared networks, especially those extending across organizational boundaries, may require additional
routing controls. This particularly applies where networks are shared with third party (nonorganization) users.

11.5

Operating system access control

Objective: To prevent unauthorized access to operating systems.
Security facilities should be used to restrict access to operating systems to authorized users. The
facilities should be capable of the following:
a)

authenticating authorized users, in accordance with a defined access control policy;

b) recording successful and failed system authentication attempts;
c)

recording the use of special system privileges;

d) issuing alarms when system security policies are breached;
e)

providing appropriate means for authentication;

f)

where appropriate, restricting the connection time of users.

11.5.1 Secure log-on procedures
Control
Access to operating systems should be controlled by a secure log-on procedure.

69

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Implementation guidance
The procedure for logging into an operating system should be designed to minimize the opportunity
for unauthorized access. The log-on procedure should therefore disclose the minimum of information
about the system, in order to avoid providing an unauthorized user with any unnecessary assistance. A
good log-on procedure should:
a) not display system or application identifiers until the log-on process has been successfully
completed;
b) display a general notice warning that the computer should only be accessed by authorized
users;
c) not provide help messages during the log-on procedure that would aid an unauthorized
user;
d) validate the log-on information only on completion of all input data. If an error condition
arises, the system should not indicate which part of the data is correct or incorrect;
e) limit the number of unsuccessful log-on attempts allowed, e.g. to three attempts, and
consider:
1) recording unsuccessful and successful attempts;
2) forcing a time delay before further log-on attempts are allowed or rejecting any
further attempts without specific authorization;
3) disconnecting data link connections;
4) sending an alarm message to the system console if the maximum number of log-on
attempts is reached;
5) setting the number of password retries in conjunction with the minimum length of the
password and the value of the system being protected;
f) limit the maximum and minimum time allowed for the log-on procedure. If exceeded, the
system should terminate the log-on;
g) display the following information on completion of a successful log-on:
1) date and time of the previous successful log-on;
2) details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts since the last successful log-on;
h) not display the password being entered or consider hiding the password characters by
symbols;
i)

not transmit passwords in clear text over a network.

Other information
If passwords are transmitted in clear text during the log-on session over a network, they may be
captured by a network ‘sniffer’ program on the network.

11.5.2 User identification and authentication
Control
All users should have a unique identifier (user ID) for their personal use only, and a suitable
authentication technique should be chosen to substantiate the claimed identity of a user.
Implementation guidance
This control should be applied for all types of users (including technical support personnel, operators,
network administrators, system programmers, and database administrators).

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
User IDs should be used to trace activities to the responsible individual. Regular user activities should
not be performed from privileged accounts.
In exceptional circumstances, where there is a clear business benefit, the use of a shared user ID for a
group of users or a specific job can be used. Approval by management should be documented for such
cases. Additional controls may be required to maintain accountability.
Generic IDs for use by an individual should only be allowed either where the functions accessible or
actions carried out by the ID do not need to be traced (e.g. read only access), or where there are other
controls in place (e.g. password for a generic ID only issued to one staff at a time and logging such
instance).
Where strong authentication and identity verification is required, authentication methods alternative to
passwords, such as cryptographic means, smart cards, tokens or biometric means, should be used.
Other information
Passwords (see also 11.3.1 and 11.5.3) are a very common way to provide identification and
authentication based on a secret that only the user knows. The same can also be achieved with
cryptographic means and authentication protocols. The strength of user identification and
authentication should be suitable to the sensitivity of the information to be accessed.
Objects such as memory tokens or smart cards that users possess can also be used for identification
and authentication. Biometric authentication technologies that use the unique characteristics or
attributes of an individual can also be used to authenticate the person’s identity. A combination of
technologies and mechanisms securely linked will result in stronger authentication.

11.5.3 Password management system
Control
Systems for managing passwords should be interactive and should ensure quality passwords.
Implementation guidance
A password management system should:
a) enforce the use of individual user IDs and passwords to maintain accountability;
b) allow users to select and change their own passwords and include a confirmation
procedure to allow for input errors;
c) enforce a choice of quality passwords (see 11.3.1);
d) enforce password changes (see 11.3.1);
e) force users to change temporary passwords at the first log-on (see 11.2.3);
f) maintain a record of previous user passwords and prevent re-use;
g) not display passwords on the screen when being entered;
h) store password files separately from application system data;
i)

store and transmit passwords in protected (e.g. encrypted or hashed) form.

Other information
Passwords are one of the principal means of validating a user’s authority to access a computer service.
Some applications require user passwords to be assigned by an independent authority; in such cases,
points b), d) and e) of the above guidance do not apply. In most cases the passwords are selected and
maintained by users. See section 11.3.1 for guidance on the use of passwords.

11.5.4 Use of system utilities
Control
The use of utility programs that might be capable of overriding system and application controls should
be restricted and tightly controlled.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines for the use of system utilities should be considered:
a) use of identification, authentication, and authorization procedures for system utilities;
b) segregation of system utilities from applications software;
c) limitation of the use of system utilities to the minimum practical number of trusted,
authorized users (see also 11.2.2);
d) authorization for ad hoc use of systems utilities;
e) limitation of the availability of system utilities, e.g. for the duration of an authorized
change;
f) logging of all use of system utilities;
g) defining and documenting of authorization levels for system utilities;
h) removal or disabling of all unnecessary software based utilities and system software;
i)

not making system utilities available to users who have access to applications on systems
where segregation of duties is required.

Other information
Most computer installations have one or more system utility programs that might be capable of
overriding system and application controls.

11.5.5 Session time-out
Control
Inactive sessions should shut down after a defined period of inactivity.
Implementation guidance
A time-out facility should clear the session screen and also, possibly later, close both application and
network sessions after a defined period of inactivity. The time-out delay should reflect the security
risks of the area, the classification of the information being handled and the applications being used,
and the risks related to the users of the equipment.
A limited form of time-out facility can be provided for some systems, which clears the screen and
prevents unauthorized access but does not close down the application or network sessions.
Other information
This control is particularly important in high risk locations, which include public or external areas
outside the organization's security management. The sessions should be shut down to prevent access
by unauthorized persons and denial of service attacks.

11.5.6 Limitation of connection time
Control
Restrictions on connection times should be used to provide additional security for high-risk
applications.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Implementation guidance
Connection time controls should be considered for sensitive computer applications, especially from
high risk locations, e.g. public or external areas that are outside the organization’s security
management. Examples of such restrictions include:
a) using predetermined time slots, e.g. for batch file transmissions, or regular interactive
sessions of short duration;
b) restricting connection times to normal office hours if there is no requirement for overtime
or extended-hours operation;
c) considering re-authentication at timed intervals.
Other information
Limiting the period during which connections to computer services are allowed reduces the window of
opportunity for unauthorized access. Limiting the duration of active sessions prevents users from
holding sessions open to prevent re-authenticating.

11.6

Application and information access control

Objective: To prevent unauthorized access to information held in application systems.
Security facilities should be used to restrict access to and within application systems.
Logical access to application software and information should be restricted to authorized users.
Application systems should:
a)

control user access to information and application system functions, in accordance with a defined
access control policy;

b) provide protection from unauthorized access by any utility, operating system software, and
malicious software that is capable of overriding or bypassing system or application controls;
c)

not compromise other systems with which information resources are shared.

11.6.1 Information access restriction
Control
Access to information and application system functions by users and support personnel should be
restricted in accordance with the defined access control policy.
Implementation guidance
Restrictions to access should be based on individual business application requirements. The access
control policy should also be consistent with the organizational access policy (see section 11.1).
Applying the following guidelines should be considered in order to support access restriction
requirements:
a) providing menus to control access to application system functions;
b) controlling the access rights of users, e.g. read, write, delete, and execute;
c) controlling access rights of other applications;
d) ensuring that outputs from application systems handling sensitive information contain
only the information relevant to the use of the output and are sent only to authorized
terminals and locations; this should include periodic reviews of such outputs to ensure
that redundant information is removed.

11.6.2 Sensitive system isolation
Control
Sensitive systems should have a dedicated (isolated) computing environment.
Implementation guidance
The following points should be considered for sensitive system isolation:
a) the sensitivity of an application system should be explicitly identified and documented by
the application owner (see 7.1.2);
b) when a sensitive application is to run in a shared environment, the application systems
with which it will share resources and the corresponding risks should be identified and
accepted by the owner of the sensitive application.
Other information
Some application systems are sufficiently sensitive to potential loss that they require special handling.
The sensitivity may indicate that the application system:
a) should run on a dedicated computer; or
b) should only share resources with trusted applications systems.
Isolation could be achieved using physical or logical methods (see also 11.4.5).

11.7

Mobile computing and teleworking

Objective: To ensure information security when using mobile computing and teleworking facilities.
The protection required should be commensurate with the risks these specific ways of working cause.
When using mobile computing the risks of working in an unprotected environment should be
considered and appropriate protection applied. In the case of teleworking the organization should
apply protection to the teleworking site and ensure that suitable arrangements are in place for this way
of working.

11.7.1 Mobile computing and communications
Control
A formal policy should be in place, and appropriate security measures should be adopted to protect
against the risks of using mobile computing and communication facilities.
Implementation guidance
When using mobile computing and communicating facilities, e.g. notebooks, palmtops, laptops, smart
cards, and mobile phones, special care should be taken to ensure that business information is not
compromised. The mobile computing policy should take into account the risks of working with
mobile computing equipment in unprotected environments.
The mobile computing policy should include the requirements for physical protection, access controls,
cryptographic techniques, back-ups, and virus protection. This policy should also include rules and
advice on connecting mobile facilities to networks and guidance on the use of these facilities in public
places.
Care should be taken when using mobile computing facilities in public places, meeting rooms and
other unprotected areas outside of the organization’s premises. Protection should be in place to avoid
the unauthorized access to or disclosure of the information stored and processed by these facilities, e.g.
using cryptographic techniques (see 12.3).
Users of mobile computing facilities in public places should take care to avoid the risk of overlooking
by unauthorized persons. Procedures against malicious software should be in place and be kept up to
date (see 10.4).

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Back-ups of critical business information should be taken regularly. Equipment should be available to
enable the quick and easy back-up of information. These back-ups should be given adequate
protection against, e.g., theft or loss of information.
Suitable protection should be given to the use of mobile facilities connected to networks. Remote
access to business information across public network using mobile computing facilities should only
take place after successful identification and authentication, and with suitable access control
mechanisms in place (see 11.4).
Mobile computing facilities should also be physically protected against theft especially when left, for
example, in cars and other forms of transport, hotel rooms, conference centres, and meeting places. A
specific procedure taking into account legal, insurance and other security requirements of the
organization should be established for cases of theft or loss of the mobile computing facilities.
Equipment carrying important, sensitive, and/or critical business information should not be left
unattended and, where possible, should be physically locked away, or special locks should be used to
secure the equipment (see 9.2.5).
Training should be arranged for personnel using mobile computing to raise their awareness on the
additional risks resulting from this way of working and the controls that should be implemented.
Other information
Mobile network wireless connections are similar to other types of network connection, but have
important differences that should be considered when identifying controls. Typical differences are
a) some wireless security protocols are immature and have known weaknesses;
b) information stored on mobile computers may not be backed-up because of limited network
bandwidth and/or because mobile equipment may not be connected at the times when back-ups
are scheduled.

11.7.2 Teleworking
Control
A policy, operational plans and procedures should be developed and implemented for teleworking
activities.
Implementation guidance
Organizations should only authorize teleworking activities if they are satisfied that appropriate
security arrangements and controls are in place, and that these comply with the organization’s security
policy.
Suitable protection of the teleworking site should be in place against, e.g., the theft of equipment and
information, the unauthorized disclosure of information, unauthorized remote access to the
organization’s internal systems or misuse of facilities. Teleworking activities should both be
authorized and controlled by management, and it should be ensured that suitable arrangements are in
place for this way of working.
The following matters should be considered:
a) the existing physical security of the teleworking site, taking into account the physical
security of the building and the local environment;
b) the proposed physical teleworking environment;
c) the communications security requirements, taking into account the need for remote access
to the organization’s internal systems, the sensitivity of the information that will be
accessed and pass over the communication link and the sensitivity of the internal system;

d) the threat of unauthorized access to information or resources from other persons using the
accommodation, e.g. family and friends;
e) the use of home networks and requirements or restrictions on the configuration of wireless
network services;
f) policies and procedures to prevent disputes concerning rights to intellectual property
developed on privately owned equipment;
g) access to privately owned equipment (to check the security of the machine or during an
investigation), which may be prevented by legislation;
h) software licensing agreements that are such that organizations may become liable for
licensing for client software on workstations owned privately by employees, contractors
or third party users;
i)

anti-virus protection and firewall requirements.

The guidelines and arrangements to be considered should include:
a) the provision of suitable equipment and storage furniture for the teleworking activities,
where the use of privately owned equipment that is not under the control of the
organization is not allowed;
b) a definition of the work permitted, the hours of work, the classification of information that
may be held and the internal systems and services that the teleworker is authorized to
access;
c) the provision of suitable communication equipment, including methods for securing
remote access;
d) physical security;
e) rules and guidance on family and visitor access to equipment and information;
f) the provision of hardware and software support and maintenance;
g) the provision of insurance;
h) the procedures for back-up and business continuity;
i)

audit and security monitoring;

j)

revocation of authority and access rights, and the return of equipment when the
teleworking activities are terminated.

Other information
Teleworking uses communications technology to enable personnel to work remotely from a fixed
location outside of their organization.

Information systems acquisition, development and maintenance

12.1

Security requirements of information systems

Objective: To ensure that security is an integral part of information systems.
Information systems include operating systems, infrastructure, business applications, off-the-shelf
products, services, and user-developed applications. The design and implementation of the
information system supporting the business process can be crucial for security. Security requirements
should be identified and agreed prior to the development and/or implementation of information
systems.
All security requirements should be identified at the requirements phase of a project and justified,
agreed, and documented as part of the overall business case for an information system.

12.1.1 Security requirements analysis and specification
Control
Statements of business requirements for new information systems, or enhancements to existing
information systems should specify the requirements for security controls.
Implementation guidance
Specifications for the requirements for controls should consider the automated controls to be
incorporated in the information system, and the need for supporting manual controls. Similar
considerations should be applied when evaluating software packages, developed or purchased, for
business applications.
Security requirements and controls should reflect the business value of the information assets involved
(see also 7.2), and the potential business damage, which might result from a failure or absence of
security.
System requirements for information security and processes for implementing security should be
integrated in the early stages of information system projects. Controls introduced at the design stage
are significantly cheaper to implement and maintain than those included during or after
implementation.
If products are purchased, a formal testing and acquisition process should be followed. Contracts with
the supplier should address the identified security requirements. Where the security functionality in a
proposed product does not satisfy the specified requirement then the risk introduced and associated
controls should be reconsidered prior to purchasing the product. Where additional functionality is
supplied and causes a security risk, this should be disabled or the proposed control structure should be
reviewed to determine if advantage can be taken of the enhanced functionality available.
Other information
If considered appropriate, for example for cost reasons, management may wish to make use of
independently evaluated and certified products. Further information about evaluation criteria for IT
security products can be found in ISO/IEC 15408 or other evaluation or certification standards, as
appropriate.
ISO/IEC TR 13335-3 provides guidance on the use of risk management processes to identify
requirements for security controls.

12.2

Correct processing in applications

Objective: To prevent errors, loss, unauthorized modification or misuse of information in applications.
Appropriate controls should be designed into applications, including user developed applications to
ensure correct processing. These controls should include the validation of input data, internal
processing and output data.
Additional controls may be required for systems that process, or have an impact on, sensitive, valuable
or critical information. Such controls should be determined on the basis of security requirements and
risk assessment.

12.2.1 Input data validation
Control
Data input to applications should be validated to ensure that this data is correct and appropriate.
Implementation guidance
Checks should be applied to the input of business transactions, standing data (e.g. names and
addresses, credit limits, customer reference numbers), and parameter tables (e.g. sales prices, currency
conversion rates, tax rates). The following guidelines should be considered:
a) dual input or other input checks, such as boundary checking or limiting fields to specific
ranges of input data, to detect the following errors:
1) out-of-range values;
2) invalid characters in data fields;
3) missing or incomplete data;
4) exceeding upper and lower data volume limits;
5) unauthorized or inconsistent control data;
b) periodic review of the content of key fields or data files to confirm their validity and
integrity;
c) inspecting hard-copy input documents for any unauthorized changes (all changes to input
documents should be authorized);
d) procedures for responding to validation errors;
e) procedures for testing the plausibility of the input data;
f) defining the responsibilities of all personnel involved in the data input process;
g) creating a log of the activities involved in the data input process (see 10.10.1).
Other information
Automatic examination and validation of input data can be considered, where applicable, to reduce the
risk of errors and to prevent standard attacks including buffer overflow and code injection.

12.2.2 Control of internal processing
Control
Validation checks should be incorporated into applications to detect any corruption of information
through processing errors or deliberate acts.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Implementation guidance
The design and implementation of applications should ensure that the risks of processing failures
leading to a loss of integrity are minimized. Specific areas to consider include:
a) the use of add, modify, and delete functions to implement changes to data;
b) the procedures to prevent programs running in the wrong order or running after failure of
prior processing (see also 10.1.1);
c) the use of appropriate programs to recover from failures to ensure the correct processing
of data;
d) protection against attacks using buffer overruns/overflows.
An appropriate checklist should be prepared, activities documented, and the results should be kept
secure. Examples of checks that can be incorporated include the following:
a) session or batch controls, to reconcile data file balances after transaction updates;
b) balancing controls, to check opening balances against previous closing balances, namely:
1) run-to-run controls;
2) file update totals;
3) program-to-program controls;
c) validation of system-generated input data (see 12.2.1);
d) checks on the integrity, authenticity or any other security feature of data or software
downloaded, or uploaded, between central and remote computers;
e) hash totals of records and files;
f) checks to ensure that application programs are run at the correct time;
g) checks to ensure that programs are run in the correct order and terminate in case of a
failure, and that further processing is halted until the problem is resolved;
h)

creating a log of the activities involved in the processing (see 10.10.1).

Other information
Data that has been correctly entered can be corrupted by hardware errors, processing errors or through
deliberate acts. The validation checks required will depend on the nature of the application and the
business impact of any corruption of data.

12.2.3 Message integrity
Control
Requirements for ensuring authenticity and protecting message integrity in applications should be
identified, and appropriate controls identified and implemented.
Implementation guidance
An assessment of security risks should be carried out to determine if message integrity is required and
to identify the most appropriate method of implementation.
Other information
Cryptographic techniques (see 12.3) can be used as an appropriate means of implementing message
authentication.

12.2.4 Output data validation
Control
Data output from an application should be validated to ensure that the processing of stored
information is correct and appropriate to the circumstances.

79

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Implementation guidance
Output validation may include:
a) plausibility checks to test whether the output data is reasonable;
b) reconciliation control counts to ensure processing of all data;
c) providing sufficient information for a reader or subsequent processing system to
determine the accuracy, completeness, precision, and classification of the information;
d) procedures for responding to output validation tests;
e) defining the responsibilities of all personnel involved in the data output process;
f) creating a log of activities in the data output validation process.
Other information
Typically, systems and applications are constructed on the assumption that having undertaken
appropriate validation, verification, and testing, the output will always be correct. However, this
assumption is not always valid; i.e. systems that have been tested may still produce incorrect output
under some circumstances.

12.3

Cryptographic controls

Objective: To protect the confidentiality, authenticity or integrity of information by cryptographic
means.
A policy should be developed on the use of cryptographic controls. Key management should be in
place to support the use of cryptographic techniques.

12.3.1 Policy on the use of cryptographic controls
Control
A policy on the use of cryptographic controls for protection of information should be developed and
implemented.
Implementation guidance
When developing a cryptographic policy the following should be considered:
a) the management approach towards the use of cryptographic controls across the
organization, including the general principles under which business information should be
protected (see also 5.1.1);
b) based on a risk assessment, the required level of protection should be identified taking
into account the type, strength, and quality of the encryption algorithm required;
c) the use of encryption for protection of sensitive information transported by mobile or
removable media, devices or across communication lines;
d) the approach to key management, including methods to deal with the protection of
cryptographic keys and the recovery of encrypted information in the case of lost,
compromised or damaged keys;
e) roles and responsibilities, e.g. who is responsible for:
1) the implementation of the policy;
2) the key management, including key generation (see also 12.3.2);

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
f) the standards to be adopted for the effective implementation throughout the organization
(which solution is used for which business processes);
g) the impact of using encrypted information on controls that rely upon content inspection
(e.g. virus detection).
When implementing the organization’s cryptographic policy, consideration should be given to the
regulations and national restrictions that might apply to the use of cryptographic techniques in
different parts of the world and to the issues of trans-border flow of encrypted information (see also
15.1.6).
Cryptographic controls can be used to achieve different security objectives, e.g.:
a) confidentiality: using encryption of information to protect sensitive or critical information,
either stored or transmitted;
b) integrity/authenticity: using digital signatures or message authentication codes to protect
the authenticity and integrity of stored or transmitted sensitive or critical information;
c) non-repudiation: using cryptographic techniques to obtain proof of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or action.
Other information
Making a decision as to whether a cryptographic solution is appropriate should be seen as part of the
wider process of risk assessment and selection of controls. This assessment can then be used to
determine whether a cryptographic control is appropriate, what type of control should be applied and
for what purpose and business processes.
A policy on the use of cryptographic controls is necessary to maximize the benefits and minimize the
risks of using cryptographic techniques, and to avoid inappropriate or incorrect use. When using
digital signatures, consideration should be given to any relevant legislation, in particular legislation
describing the conditions under which a digital signature is legally binding (see 15.1).
Specialist advice should be sought to identify the appropriate level of protection and to define suitable
specifications that will provide the required protection and support the implementation of a secure key
management system (see also 12.3.2).
ISO/IEC JTC1 SC27 has developed several standards related to cryptographic controls. Further
information can also be found in IEEE P1363 and the OECD Guidelines on Cryptography.

12.3.2 Key management
Control
Key management should be in place to support the organization’s use of cryptographic techniques.
Implementation guidance
All cryptographic keys should be protected against modification, loss, and destruction. In addition,
secret and private keys need protection against unauthorized disclosure. Equipment used to generate,
store and archive keys should be physically protected.
A key management system should be based on an agreed set of standards, procedures, and secure
methods for:
a) generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications;
b) generating and obtaining public key certificates;

81

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
c) distributing keys to intended users, including how keys should be activated when
received;
d) storing keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys;
e) changing or updating keys including rules on when keys should be changed and how this
will be done;
f) dealing with compromised keys;
g) revoking keys including how keys should be withdrawn or deactivated, e.g. when keys
have been compromised or when a user leaves an organization (in which case keys should
also be archived);
h) recovering keys that are lost or corrupted as part of business continuity management, e.g.
for recovery of encrypted information;
i)

archiving keys, e.g. for information archived or backed up;

j)

destroying keys;

k) logging and auditing of key management related activities.
In order to reduce the likelihood of compromise, activation, and deactivation dates for keys should be
defined so that the keys can only be used for a limited period of time. This period of time should be
dependent on the circumstances under which the cryptographic control is being used, and the
perceived risk.
In addition to securely managing secret and private keys, the authenticity of public keys should also
be considered. This authentication process can be done using public key certificates which are
normally issued by a certification authority, which should be a recognized organization with suitable
controls and procedures in place to provide the required degree of trust.
The contents of service level agreements or contracts with external suppliers of cryptographic
services, e.g. with a certification authority, should cover issues of liability, reliability of services and
response times for the provision of services (see 6.2.3).
Other information
The management of cryptographic keys is essential to the effective use of cryptographic techniques.
ISO/IEC 11770 provides further information on key management. The two types of cryptographic
techniques are:
a) secret key techniques, where two or more parties share the same key and this key is used
both to encrypt and decrypt information; this key has to be kept secret since anyone
having access to the key is able to decrypt all information being encrypted with that key,
or to introduce unauthorized information using the key;
b) public key techniques, where each user has a key pair, a public key (which can be
revealed to anyone) and a private key (which has to be kept secret); public key techniques
can be used for encryption and to produce digital signatures (see also ISO/IEC 9796 and
ISO/IEC 14888).
There is a threat of forging a digital signature by replacing a user’s public key. This problem is
addressed by the use of a public key certificate.
Cryptographic techniques can also be used to protect cryptographic keys. Procedures may need to be
considered for handling legal requests for access to cryptographic keys, e.g. encrypted information
may need to be made available in an unencrypted form as evidence in a court case.

12.4

Security of system files

Objective: To ensure the security of system files.
Access to system files and program source code should be controlled, and IT projects and support
activities conducted in a secure manner. Care should be taken to avoid exposure of sensitive data in
test environments.

12.4.1 Control of operational software
Control
There should be procedures in place to control the installation of software on operational systems.
Implementation guidance
To minimize the risk of corruption to operational systems, the following guidelines should be
considered to control changes:
a) the updating of the operational software, applications, and program libraries should only
be performed by trained administrators upon appropriate management authorization (see
12.4.3);
b) operational systems should only hold approved executable code, and not development
code or compilers;
c) applications and operating system software should only be implemented after extensive
and successful testing; the tests should include tests on usability, security, effects on other
systems and user-friendliness, and should be carried out on separate systems (see also
10.1.4); it should be ensured that all corresponding program source libraries have been
updated;
d) a configuration control system should be used to keep control of all implemented software
as well as the system documentation;
e) a rollback strategy should be in place before changes are implemented;
f) an audit log should be maintained of all updates to operational program libraries;
g) previous versions of application software should be retained as a contingency measure;
h) old versions of software should be archived, together with all required information and
parameters, procedures, configuration details, and supporting software for as long as the
data is retained in archive.
Vendor supplied software used in operational systems should be maintained at a level supported by
the supplier. Over time, software vendors will cease to support older versions of software. The
organization should consider the risks of relying on unsupported software.
Any decision to upgrade to a new release should take into account the business requirements for the
change, and the security of the release, i.e. the introduction of new security functionality or the
number and severity of security problems affecting this version. Software patches should be applied
when they can help to remove or reduce security weaknesses (see also 12.6.1).
Physical or logical access should only be given to suppliers for support purposes when necessary, and
with management approval. The supplier’s activities should be monitored.
Computer software may rely on externally supplied software and modules, which should be monitored
and controlled to avoid unauthorized changes, which could introduce security weaknesses.

83

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Other information
Operating systems should only be upgraded when there is a requirement to do so, for example, if the
current version of the operating system no longer supports the business requirements. Upgrades
should not take place just because a new version of the operating system is available. New versions of
operating systems may be less secure, less stable, and less well understood than current systems.

12.4.2 Protection of system test data
Control
Test data should be selected carefully, and protected and controlled.
Implementation guidance
The use of operational databases containing personal information or any other sensitive information
for testing purposes should be avoided. If personal or otherwise sensitive information is used for
testing purposes, all sensitive details and content should be removed or modified beyond recognition
before use. The following guidelines should be applied to protect operational data, when used for
testing purposes:
a) the access control procedures, which apply to operational application systems, should also
apply to test application systems;
b) there should be separate authorization each time operational information is copied to a test
application system;
c) operational information should be erased from a test application system immediately after
the testing is complete;
d) the copying and use of operational information should be logged to provide an audit trail.
Other information
System and acceptance testing usually requires substantial volumes of test data that are as close as
possible to operational data.

12.4.3 Access control to program source code
Control
Access to program source code should be restricted.
Implementation guidance
Access to program source code and associated items (such as designs, specifications, verification
plans and validation plans) should be strictly controlled, in order to prevent the introduction of
unauthorized functionality and to avoid unintentional changes. For program source code, this can be
achieved by controlled central storage of such code, preferably in program source libraries. The
following guidelines should then be considered (see also 11) to control access to such program source
libraries in order to reduce the potential for corruption of computer programs:
a) where possible, program source libraries should not be held in operational systems;
b) the program source code and the program source libraries should be managed according
to established procedures;
c) support personnel should not have unrestricted access to program source libraries;
d) the updating of program source libraries and associated items, and the issuing of program
sources to programmers should only be performed after appropriate authorization has
been received;
e) program listings should be held in a secure environment (see 10.7.4);

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
f) an audit log should be maintained of all accesses to program source libraries;
g) maintenance and copying of program source libraries should be subject to strict change
control procedures (see 12.5.1).
Other information
Program source code is code written by programmers, which is compiled (and linked) to create
executables. Certain programming languages do not formally distinguish between source code and
executables as the executables are created at the time they are activated.
The standards ISO 10007 and ISO/IEC 12207 provide further information about configuration
management and the software lifecycle process.

12.5

Security in development and support processes

Objective: To maintain the security of application system software and information.
Project and support environments should be strictly controlled.
Managers responsible for application systems should also be responsible for the security of the project
or support environment. They should ensure that all proposed system changes are reviewed to check
that they do not compromise the security of either the system or the operating environment.

12.5.1 Change control procedures
Control
The implementation of changes should be controlled by the use of formal change control procedures.
Implementation guidance
Formal change control procedures should be documented and enforced in order to minimize the
corruption of information systems. Introduction of new systems and major changes to existing
systems should follow a formal process of documentation, specification, testing, quality control, and
managed implementation.
This process should include a risk assessment, analysis of the impacts of changes, and specification of
security controls needed. This process should also ensure that existing security and control
procedures are not compromised, that support programmers are given access only to those parts of the
system necessary for their work, and that formal agreement and approval for any change is obtained.
Wherever practicable, application and operational change control procedures should be integrated (see
also 10.1.2). The change procedures should include:
a) maintaining a record of agreed authorization levels;
b) ensuring changes are submitted by authorized users;
c) reviewing controls and integrity procedures to ensure that they will not be compromised
by the changes;
d) identifying all software, information, database entities, and hardware that require
amendment;
e) obtaining formal approval for detailed proposals before work commences;
f) ensuring authorized users accept changes prior to implementation;
g) ensuring that the system documentation set is updated on the completion of each change
and that old documentation is archived or disposed of;
h) maintaining a version control for all software updates;
i)

maintaining an audit trail of all change requests;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
j)

ensuring that operating documentation (see 10.1.1) and user procedures are changed as
necessary to remain appropriate;

k) ensuring that the implementation of changes takes place at the right time and does not
disturb the business processes involved.
Other information
Changing software can impact the operational environment.
Good practice includes the testing of new software in an environment segregated from both the
production and development environments (see also 10.1.4). This provides a means of having control
over new software and allowing additional protection of operational information that is used for
testing purposes. This should include patches, service packs, and other updates. Automated updates
should not be used on critical systems as some updates may cause critical applications to fail (see
12.6).

12.5.2 Technical review of applications after operating system changes
Control
When operating systems are changed, business critical applications should be reviewed and tested to
ensure there is no adverse impact on organizational operations or security.
Implementation guidance
This process should cover:
a) review of application control and integrity procedures to ensure that they have not been
compromised by the operating system changes;
b) ensuring that the annual support plan and budget will cover reviews and system testing
resulting from operating system changes;
c) ensuring that notification of operating system changes is provided in time to allow
appropriate tests and reviews to take place before implementation;
d) ensuring that appropriate changes are made to the business continuity plans (see clause
14).
A specific group or individual should be given responsibility for monitoring vulnerabilities and
vendors’ releases of patches and fixes (see 12.6).

12.5.3 Restrictions on changes to software packages
Control
Modifications to software packages should be discouraged, limited to necessary changes, and all
changes should be strictly controlled.
Implementation guidance
As far as possible, and practicable, vendor-supplied software packages should be used without
modification. Where a software package needs to be modified the following points should be
considered:
a) the risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being compromised;
b) whether the consent of the vendor should be obtained;
c) the possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as standard program
updates;
d) the impact if the organization becomes responsible for the future maintenance of the
software as a result of changes.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
If changes are necessary the original software should be retained and the changes applied to a clearly
identified copy. A software update management process should be implemented to ensure the most
up-to-date approved patches and application updates are installed for all authorized software (see
12.6). All changes should be fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied if necessary
to future software upgrades. If required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an
independent evaluation body.

12.5.4 Information leakage
Control
Opportunities for information leakage should be prevented.
Implementation guidance
The following should be considered to limit the risk of information leakage, e.g. through the use and
exploitation of covert channels:
a) scanning of outbound media and communications for hidden information;
b) masking and modulating system and communications behaviour to reduce the likelihood
of a third party being able to deduce information from such behaviour;
c) making use of systems and software that are considered to be of high integrity, e.g. using
evaluated products (see ISO/IEC 15408);
d) regular monitoring of personnel and system activities, where permitted under existing
legislation or regulation;
e) monitoring resource usage in computer systems.
Other information
Covert Channels are paths which are not intended to conduct information flows, but which may
nevertheless exist in a system or network. For example, manipulating bits in communications protocol
packets could be used as a hidden method of signaling. By their nature, preventing the existence of all
possible covert channels would be difficult, if not impossible. However, the exploitation of such
channels is often carried out by Trojan code (see also 10.4.1). Taking measures to protect against
Trojan code therefore reduces the risk of covert channel exploitation.
Prevention of unauthorized network access (11.4), as well as policies and procedures to discourage
misuse of information services by personnel (15.1.5), will help to protect against covert channels.

12.5.5 Outsourced software development
Control
Outsourced software development should be supervised and monitored by the organization.
Implementation guidance
Where software development is outsourced, the following points should be considered:
a) licensing arrangements, code ownership, and intellectual property rights (see 15.1.2);
b) certification of the quality and accuracy of the work carried out;
c) escrow arrangements in the event of failure of the third party;
d) rights of access for audit of the quality and accuracy of work done;
e) contractual requirements for quality and security functionality of code;
f) testing before installation to detect malicious and Trojan code.

Objective: To reduce risks resulting from exploitation of published technical vulnerabilities.
Technical vulnerability management should be implemented in an effective, systematic, and
repeatable way with measurements taken to confirm its effectiveness. These considerations should
include operating systems, and any other applications in use.

12.6.1 Control of technical vulnerabilities
Control
Timely information about technical vulnerabilities of information systems being used should be
obtained, the organization's exposure to such vulnerabilities evaluated, and appropriate measures
taken to address the associated risk.
Implementation guidance
A current and complete inventory of assets (see 7.1) is a prerequisite for effective technical
vulnerability management. Specific information needed to support technical vulnerability
management includes the software vendor, version numbers, current state of deployment (e.g. what
software is installed on what systems), and the person(s) within the organization responsible for the
software.
Appropriate, timely action should be taken in response to the identification of potential technical
vulnerabilities. The following guidance should be followed to establish an effective management
process for technical vulnerabilities:
a) the organization should define and establish the roles and responsibilities associated with
technical vulnerability management, including vulnerability monitoring, vulnerability risk
assessment, patching, asset tracking, and any coordination responsibilities required;
b) information resources that will be used to identify relevant technical vulnerabilities and to
maintain awareness about them should be identified for software and other technology
(based on the asset inventory list, see 7.1.1); these information resources should be
updated based on changes in the inventory, or when other new or useful resources are
found;
c) a timeline should be defined to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical
vulnerabilities;
d) once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified, the organization should
identify the associated risks and the actions to be taken; such action could involve
patching of vulnerable systems and/or applying other controls;
e) depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, the action
taken should be carried out according to the controls related to change management (see
12.5.1) or by following information security incident response procedures (see 13.2);
f) if a patch is available, the risks associated with installing the patch should be assessed (the
risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the patch);
g) patches should be tested and evaluated before they are installed to ensure they are
effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be tolerated; if no patch is available,
other controls should be considered, such as
1) turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability;
2) adapting or adding access controls, e.g. firewalls, at network borders (see 11.4.5);
3) increased monitoring to detect or prevent actual attacks;
4) raising awareness of the vulnerability;

h) an audit log should be kept for all procedures undertaken;
i)

the technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and
evaluated in order to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency;

j)

systems at high risk should be addressed first.

Other information
The correct functioning of an organization’s technical vulnerability management process is critical to
many organizations and should therefore be regularly monitored. An accurate inventory is essential to
ensure that potentially relevant technical vulnerabilities are identified.
Technical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as
such can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures (see 10.1.2 and 12.5.1).
Vendors are often under significant pressure to release patches as soon as possible. Therefore, a patch
may not address the problem adequately and may have negative side effects. Also, in some cases,
uninstalling a patch may not be easily achieved once the patch has been applied.
If adequate testing of the patches is not possible, e.g. because of costs or lack of resources, a delay in
patching can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other
users.

Information security incident management

13.1

Reporting information security events and weaknesses

Objective: To ensure information security events and weaknesses associated with information systems
are communicated in a manner allowing timely corrective action to be taken.
Formal event reporting and escalation procedures should be in place. All employees, contractors and
third party users should be made aware of the procedures for reporting the different types of event and
weakness that might have an impact on the security of organizational assets. They should be required
to report any information security events and weaknesses as quickly as possible to the designated
point of contact.

13.1.1 Reporting information security events
Control
Information security events should be reported through appropriate management channels as quickly
as possible.
Implementation guidance
A formal information security event reporting procedure should be established, together with an
incident response and escalation procedure, setting out the action to be taken on receipt of a report of
an information security event. A point of contact should be established for the reporting of
information security events. It should be ensured that this point of contact is known throughout the
organization, is always available and is able to provide adequate and timely response.
All employees, contractors and third party users should be made aware of their responsibility to report
any information security events as quickly as possible. They should also be aware of the procedure
for reporting information security events and the point of contact. The reporting procedures should
include:
a) suitable feedback processes to ensure that those reporting information security events are
notified of results after the issue has been dealt with and closed;
b) information security event reporting forms to support the reporting action, and to help the
person reporting to remember all necessary actions in case of an information security
event;
c) the correct behaviour to be undertaken in case of an information security event, i.e.
1) noting all important details (e.g. type of non-compliance or breach, occurring
malfunction, messages on the screen, strange behaviour) immediately;
2) not carrying out any own action, but immediately reporting to the point of contact;
d) reference to an established formal disciplinary process for dealing with employees,
contractors or third party users who commit security breaches.
In high-risk environments, a duress alarm 4 may be provided whereby a person under duress can
indicate such problems. The procedures for responding to duress alarms should reflect the high risk
situation such alarms are indicating.

4

A duress alarm is a method for secretly indicating that an action is taking place 'under duress.'

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Other Information
Examples of information security events and incidents are:
a) loss of service, equipment or facilities,
b) system malfunctions or overloads,
c) human errors,
d) non-compliances with policies or guidelines,
e) breaches of physical security arrangements,
f) uncontrolled system changes,
g) malfunctions of software or hardware,
h) access violations.
With due care of confidentiality aspects, information security incidents can be used in user awareness
training (see 8.2.2) as examples of what could happen, how to respond to such incidents, and how to
avoid them in the future. To be able to address information security events and incidents properly it
might be necessary to collect evidence as soon as possible after the occurrence (see 13.2.3).
Malfunctions or other anomalous system behavior may be an indicator of a security attack or actual
security breach and should therefore always be reported as information security event.
More information about reporting of information security events and management of information
security incidents can be found in ISO/IEC TR 18044.

13.1.2 Reporting security weaknesses
Control
All employees, contractors and third party users of information systems and services should be
required to note and report any observed or suspected security weaknesses in systems or services.
Implementation guidance
All employees, contractors and third party users should report these matters either to their
management or directly to their service provider as quickly as possible in order to prevent information
security incidents. The reporting mechanism should be as easy, accessible, and available as possible.
They should be informed that they should not, in any circumstances, attempt to prove a suspected
weakness.
Other Information
Employees, contractors and third party users should be advised not to attempt to prove suspected
security weaknesses. Testing weaknesses might be interpreted as a potential misuse of the system and
could also cause damage to the information system or service and result in legal liability for the
individual performing the testing.

13.2

Management of information security incidents and improvements

Objective: To ensure a consistent and effective approach is applied to the management of information
security incidents.
Responsibilities and procedures should be in place to handle information security events and
weaknesses effectively once they have been reported. A process of continual improvement should be
applied to the response to, monitoring, evaluating, and overall management of information security
incidents.
Where evidence is required, it should be collected to ensure compliance with legal requirements.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)

13.2.1 Responsibilities and procedures
Control
Management responsibilities and procedures should be established to ensure a quick, effective, and
orderly response to information security incidents.
Implementation guidance
In addition to reporting of information security events and weaknesses (see also 13.1), the monitoring
of systems, alerts, and vulnerabilities (10.10.2) should be used to detect information security incidents.
The following guidelines for information security incident management procedures should be
considered:
a) procedures should be established to handle different types of information security incident,
including:
1) information system failures and loss of service;
2) malicious code (see 10.4.1);
3) denial of service;
4) errors resulting from incomplete or inaccurate business data;
5) breaches of confidentiality and integrity;
6) misuse of information systems;
b) in addition to normal contingency plans (see 14.1.3), the procedures should also cover
(see also 13.2.2):
1) analysis and identification of the cause of the incident;
2) containment;
3) planning and implementation of corrective action to prevent recurrence, if necessary;
4) communication with those affected by or involved with recovery from the incident;
5) reporting the action to the appropriate authority;
c) audit trails and similar evidence should be collected (see 13.2.3) and secured, as
appropriate, for:
1) internal problem analysis;
2) use as forensic evidence in relation to a potential breach of contract or
regulatory requirement or in the event of civil or criminal proceedings, e.g. under
computer misuse or data protection legislation;
3) negotiating for compensation from software and service suppliers;
d) action to recover from security breaches and correct system failures should be carefully
and formally controlled; the procedures should ensure that:
1) only clearly identified and authorized personnel are allowed access to live systems
and data (see also 6.2 for external access);
2) all emergency actions taken are documented in detail;
3) emergency action is reported to management and reviewed in an orderly manner;
4) the integrity of business systems and controls is confirmed with minimal delay.
The objectives for information security incident management should be agreed with management, and
it should be ensured that those responsible for information security incident management understand
the organization’s priorities for handling information security incidents.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Other information
Information security incidents might transcend organizational and national boundaries. To respond to
such incidents there is an increasing need to coordinate response and share information about these
incidents with external organizations as appropriate.

13.2.2 Learning from information security incidents
Control
There should be mechanisms in place to enable the types, volumes, and costs of information security
incidents to be quantified and monitored.
Implementation guidance
The information gained from the evaluation of information security incidents should be used to
identify recurring or high impact incidents.
Other Information
The evaluation of information security incidents may indicate the need for enhanced or additional
controls to limit the frequency, damage, and cost of future occurrences, or to be taken into account in
the security policy review process (see 5.1.2).

13.2.3 Collection of evidence
Control
Where a follow-up action against a person or organization after an information security incident
involves legal action (either civil or criminal), evidence should be collected, retained, and presented to
conform to the rules for evidence laid down in the relevant jurisdiction(s).
Implementation guidance
Internal procedures should be developed and followed when collecting and presenting evidence for
the purposes of disciplinary action handled within an organization.
In general, the rules for evidence cover:
a) admissibility of evidence: whether or not the evidence can be used in court;
b) weight of evidence: the quality and completeness of the evidence.
To achieve admissibility of the evidence, the organization should ensure that their information
systems comply with any published standard or code of practice for the production of admissible
evidence.
The weight of evidence provided should comply with any applicable requirements. To achieve weight
of evidence, the quality and completeness of the controls used to correctly and consistently protect the
evidence (i.e. process control evidence) throughout the period that the evidence to be recovered was
stored and processed should be demonstrated by a strong evidence trail. In general, such a strong trail
can be established under the following conditions:
a) for paper documents: the original is kept securely with a record of the individual who
found the document, where the document was found, when the document was found and
who witnessed the discovery; any investigation should ensure that originals are not
tampered with;
b) for information on computer media: mirror images or copies (depending on applicable
requirements) of any removable media, information on hard disks or in memory should be
taken to ensure availability; the log of all actions during the copying process should be
kept and the process should be witnessed; the original media and the log (if this is not
possible, at least one mirror image or copy) should be kept securely and untouched.

93

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Any forensics work should only be performed on copies of the evidential material. The integrity of all
evidential material should be protected. Copying of evidential material should be supervised by
trustworthy personnel and information on when and where the copying process was executed, who
performed the copying activities and which tools and programs have been utilized should be logged.
Other information
When an information security event is first detected, it may not be obvious whether or not the event
will result in court action. Therefore, the danger exists that necessary evidence is destroyed
intentionally or accidentally before the seriousness of the incident is realized. It is advisable to involve
a lawyer or the police early in any contemplated legal action and take advice on the evidence required.
Evidence may transcend organizational and/or jurisdictional boundaries. In such cases, it should be
ensured that the organization is entitled to collect the required information as evidence. The
requirements of different jurisdictions should also be considered to maximize chances of admission
across the relevant jurisdictions.

Business continuity management

14.1

Information security aspects of business continuity management

Objective: To counteract interruptions to business activities and to protect critical business processes
from the effects of major failures of information systems or disasters and to ensure their timely
resumption.
A business continuity management process should be implemented to minimize the impact on the
organization and recover from loss of information assets (which may be the result of, for example,
natural disasters, accidents, equipment failures, and deliberate actions) to an acceptable level through
a combination of preventive and recovery controls. This process should identify the critical business
processes and integrate the information security management requirements of business continuity with
other continuity requirements relating to such aspects as operations, staffing, materials, transport and
facilities.
The consequences of disasters, security failures, loss of service, and service availability should be
subject to a business impact analysis. Business continuity plans should be developed and implemented
to ensure timely resumption of essential operations. Information security should be an integral part of
the overall business continuity process, and other management processes within the organization.
Business continuity management should include controls to identify and reduce risks, in addition to
the general risks assessment process, limit the consequences of damaging incidents, and ensure that
information required for business processes is readily available.

14.1.1 Including information security in the business continuity management process
Control
A managed process should be developed and maintained for business continuity throughout the
organization that addresses the information security requirements needed for the organization’s
business continuity.
Implementation guidance
The process should bring together the following key elements of business continuity management:
a) understanding the risks the organization is facing in terms of likelihood and impact in
time, including an identification and prioritisation of critical business processes (see
14.1.2);
b) identifying all the assets involved in critical business processes (see 7.1.1);
c) understanding the impact which interruptions caused by information security incidents are
likely to have on the business (it is important that solutions are found that will handle
incidents causing smaller impact, as well as serious incidents that could threaten the
viability of the organization), and establishing the business objectives of information
processing facilities;
d) considering the purchase of suitable insurance which may form part of the overall
business continuity process, as well as being part of operational risk management;
e) identifying and considering the implementation of additional preventive and mitigating
controls;
f) identifying sufficient financial, organizational, technical, and environmental resources to
address the identified information security requirements;
g) ensuring the safety of personnel and the protection of information processing facilities
and organizational property;

95

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
h) formulating and documenting business continuity plans addressing information security
requirements in line with the agreed business continuity strategy (see 14.1.3);
i)

regular testing and updating of the plans and processes put in place (see 14.1.5);

j)

ensuring that the management of business continuity is incorporated in the organization’s
processes and structure; responsibility for the business continuity management process
should be assigned at an appropriate level within the organization (see 6.1.1).

14.1.2 Business continuity and risk assessment
Control
Events that can cause interruptions to business processes should be identified, along with the
probability and impact of such interruptions and their consequences for information security.
Implementation guidance
Information security aspects of business continuity should be based on identifying events (or sequence
of events) that can cause interruptions to the organizations business processes, e.g. equipment failure,
human errors, theft, fire, natural disasters and acts of terrorism. This should be followed by a risk
assessment to determine the probability and impact of such interruptions, in terms of time, damage
scale and recovery period.
Business continuity risk assessments should be carried out with full involvement from owners of
business resources and processes. This assessment should consider all business processes and should
not be limited to the information processing facilities, but should include the results specific to
information security. It is important to link the different risk aspects together, to obtain a complete
picture of the business continuity requirements of the organization. The assessment should identify,
quantify, and prioritise risks against criteria and objectives relevant to the organization, including
critical resources, impacts of disruptions, allowable outage times, and recovery priorities.
Depending on the results of the risk assessment, a business continuity strategy should be developed to
determine the overall approach to business continuity. Once this strategy has been created,
endorsement should be provided by management, and a plan created and endorsed to implement this
strategy.

14.1.3 Developing and implementing continuity plans including information security
Control
Plans should be developed and implemented to maintain or restore operations and ensure availability
of information at the required level and in the required time scales following interruption to, or failure
of, critical business processes.
Implementation guidance
The business continuity planning process should consider the following:
a) identification and agreement of all responsibilities and business continuity procedures;
b) identification of the acceptable loss of information and services;
c) implementation of the procedures to allow recovery and restoration of business operations
and availability of information in required time-scales; particular attention needs to be
given to the assessment of internal and external business dependencies and the contracts
in place;
d) operational procedures to follow pending completion of recovery and restoration;
e) documentation of agreed procedures and processes;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
f) appropriate education of staff in the agreed procedures and processes, including crisis
management;
g) testing and updating of the plans.
The planning process should focus on the required business objectives, e.g. restoring of specific
communication services to customers in an acceptable amount of time. The services and resources
facilitating this should be identified, including staffing, non-information processing resources, as well
as fallback arrangements for information processing facilities. Such fallback arrangements may
include arrangements with third parties in the form of reciprocal agreements, or commercial
subscription services.
Business continuity plans should address organizational vulnerabilities and therefore may contain
sensitive information that needs to be appropriately protected. Copies of business continuity plans
should be stored in a remote location, at a sufficient distance to escape any damage from a disaster at
the main site. Management should ensure copies of the business continuity plans are up-to-date and
protected with the same level of security as applied at the main site. Other material necessary to
execute the continuity plans should also be stored at the remote location.
If alternative temporary locations are used, the level of implemented security controls at these
locations should be equivalent to the main site.
Other information
It should be noted that crisis management plans and activities (see 14.1.3 f)) may be different from
business continuity management; i.e. a crisis may occur that can be accommodated by normal
management procedures.

14.1.4 Business continuity planning framework
Control
A single framework of business continuity plans should be maintained to ensure all plans are
consistent, to consistently address information security requirements, and to identify priorities for
testing and maintenance.
Implementation guidance
Each business continuity plan should describe the approach for continuity, for example the approach
to ensure information or information system availability and security. Each plan should also specify
the escalation plan and the conditions for its activation, as well as the individuals responsible for
executing each component of the plan. When new requirements are identified, any existing emergency
procedures, e.g. evacuation plans or fallback arrangements, should be amended as appropriate.
Procedures should be included within the organization’s change management programme to ensure
that business continuity matters are always addressed appropriately.
Each plan should have a specific owner. Emergency procedures, manual fallback plans, and
resumption plans should be within the responsibility of the owners of the appropriate business
resources or processes involved. Fallback arrangements for alternative technical services, such as
information processing and communications facilities, should usually be the responsibility of the
service providers.
A business continuity planning framework should address the identified information security
requirements and consider the following:
a) the conditions for activating the plans which describe the process to be followed (e.g. how
to assess the situation, who is to be involved) before each plan is activated;

97

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
b) emergency procedures, which describe the actions to be taken following an incident,
which jeopardizes business operations;
c) fallback procedures which describe the actions to be taken to move essential business
activities or support services to alternative temporary locations, and to bring business
processes back into operation in the required time-scales;
d) temporary operational procedures to follow pending completion of recovery and
restoration;
e) resumption procedures which describe the actions to be taken to return to normal business
operations;
f) a maintenance schedule which specifies how and when the plan will be tested, and the
process for maintaining the plan;
g) awareness, education, and training activities which are designed to create understanding
of the business continuity processes and ensure that the processes continue to be effective;
h) the responsibilities of the individuals, describing who is responsible for executing which
component of the plan. Alternatives should be nominated as required;
i)

the critical assets and resources needed to be able to perform the emergency, fallback and
resumption procedures.

14.1.5 Testing, maintaining and re-assessing business continuity plans
Control
Business continuity plans should be tested and updated regularly to ensure that they are up to date and
effective.
Implementation guidance
Business continuity plan tests should ensure that all members of the recovery team and other relevant
staff are aware of the plans and their responsibility for business continuity and information security
and know their role when a plan is invoked.
The test schedule for business continuity plan(s) should indicate how and when each element of the
plan should be tested. Each element of the plan(s) should be tested frequently.
A variety of techniques should be used in order to provide assurance that the plan(s) will operate in
real life. These should include:
a) table-top testing of various scenarios (discussing the business recovery arrangements
using example interruptions);
b) simulations (particularly for training people in their post-incident/crisis management
roles);
c) technical recovery testing (ensuring information systems can be restored effectively);
d) testing recovery at an alternate site (running business processes in parallel with recovery
operations away from the main site);
e) tests of supplier facilities and services (ensuring externally provided services and products
will meet the contracted commitment);
f) complete rehearsals (testing that the organization, personnel, equipment, facilities, and
processes can cope with interruptions).

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
These techniques can be used by any organization. They should be applied in a way that is relevant to
the specific recovery plan. The results of tests should be recorded and actions taken to improve the
plans, where necessary.
Responsibility should be assigned for regular reviews of each business continuity plan. The
identification of changes in business arrangements not yet reflected in the business continuity plans
should be followed by an appropriate update of the plan. This formal change control process should
ensure that the updated plans are distributed and reinforced by regular reviews of the complete plan.
Examples of changes where updating of business continuity plans should be considered are
acquisition of new equipment, upgrading of systems and changes in:
a) personnel;
b) addresses or telephone numbers;
c) business strategy;
d) location, facilities, and resources;
e) legislation;
f) contractors, suppliers, and key customers;
g) processes, or new or withdrawn ones;
h) risk (operational and financial).

Compliance

15.1

Compliance with legal requirements

Objective: To avoid breaches of any law, statutory, regulatory or contractual obligations, and of any
security requirements.
The design, operation, use, and management of information systems may be subject to statutory,
regulatory, and contractual security requirements.
Advice on specific legal requirements should be sought from the organization’s legal advisers, or
suitably qualified legal practitioners. Legislative requirements vary from country to country and may
vary for information created in one country that is transmitted to another country (i.e. trans-border
data flow).

15.1.1 Identification of applicable legislation
Control
All relevant statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements and the organization’s approach to
meet these requirements should be explicitly defined, documented, and kept up to date for each
information system and the organization.
Implementation guidance
The specific controls and individual responsibilities to meet these requirements should be similarly
defined and documented.

15.1.2 Intellectual property rights (IPR)
Control
Appropriate procedures should be implemented to ensure compliance with legislative, regulatory, and
contractual requirements on the use of material in respect of which there may be intellectual property
rights and on the use of proprietary software products.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered to protect any material that may be considered
intellectual property:
a) publishing an intellectual property rights compliance policy which defines the legal use of
software and information products;
b) acquiring software only through known and reputable sources, to ensure that copyright is
not violated;
c) maintaining awareness of policies to protect intellectual property rights, and giving notice
of the intent to take disciplinary action against personnel breaching them;
d) maintaining appropriate asset registers, and identifying all assets with requirements to
protect intellectual property rights;
e) maintaining proof and evidence of ownership of licenses, master disks, manuals, etc;
f) implementing controls to ensure that any maximum number of users permitted is not
exceeded;
g) carrying out checks that only authorized software and licensed products are installed;
h) providing a policy for maintaining appropriate licence conditions;
i)

providing a policy for disposing or transferring software to others;

j)

using appropriate audit tools;

k) complying with terms and conditions for software and information obtained from public
networks;
l)

not duplicating, converting to another format or extracting from commercial recordings
(film, audio) other than permitted by copyright law;

m) not copying in full or in part, books, articles, reports or other documents, other than
permitted by copyright law.
Other information
Intellectual property rights include software or document copyright, design rights, trademarks, patents,
and source code licenses.
Proprietary software products are usually supplied under a license agreement that specifies license
terms and conditions, for example, limiting the use of the products to specified machines or limiting
copying to the creation of back-up copies only. The IPR situation of software developed by the
organization requires to be clarified with the staff.
Legislative, regulatory, and contractual requirements may place restrictions on the copying of
proprietary material. In particular, they may require that only material that is developed by the
organization, or that is licensed or provided by the developer to the organization, can be used.
Copyright infringement can lead to legal action, which may involve criminal proceedings.

15.1.3 Protection of organizational records
Control
Important records should be protected from loss, destruction, and falsification, in accordance with
statutory, regulatory, contractual, and business requirements.
Implementation guidance
Records should be categorized into record types, e.g. accounting records, database records, transaction
logs, audit logs, and operational procedures, each with details of retention periods and type of storage
media, e.g. paper, microfiche, magnetic, optical. Any related cryptographic keying material and
programs associated with encrypted archives or digital signatures (see 12.3), should also be stored to
enable decryption of the records for the length of time the records are retained.
Consideration should be given to the possibility of deterioration of media used for storage of records.
Storage and handling procedures should be implemented in accordance with manufacturer’s
recommendations. For long term storage, the use of paper and microfiche should be considered.
Where electronic storage media are chosen, procedures to ensure the ability to access data (both media
and format readability) throughout the retention period should be included, to safeguard against loss
due to future technology change.
Data storage systems should be chosen such that required data can be retrieved in an acceptable
timeframe and format, depending on the requirements to be fulfilled.
The system of storage and handling should ensure clear identification of records and of their retention
period as defined by national or regional legislation or regulations, if applicable. This system should
permit appropriate destruction of records after that period if they are not needed by the organization.
To meet these record safeguarding objectives, the following steps should be taken within an
organization:
a) guidelines should be issued on the retention, storage, handling, and disposal of records
and information;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
b) a retention schedule should be drawn up identifying records and the period of time for
which they should be retained;
c) an inventory of sources of key information should be maintained;
d) appropriate controls should be implemented to protect records and information from loss,
destruction, and falsification.
Other information
Some records may need to be securely retained to meet statutory, regulatory or contractual
requirements, as well as to support essential business activities. Examples include records that may be
required as evidence that an organization operates within statutory or regulatory rules, to ensure
adequate defense against potential civil or criminal action, or to confirm the financial status of an
organization with respect to shareholders, external parties, and auditors. The time period and data
content for information retention may be set by national law or regulation.
Further information about managing organizational records can be found in ISO 15489-1.

15.1.4 Data protection and privacy of personal information
Control
Data protection and privacy should be ensured as required in relevant legislation, regulations, and, if
applicable, contractual clauses.
Implementation guidance
An organizational data protection and privacy policy should be developed and implemented. This
policy should be communicated to all persons involved in the processing of personal information.
Compliance with this policy and all relevant data protection legislation and regulations requires
appropriate management structure and control. Often this is best achieved by the appointment of a
person responsible, such as a data protection officer, who should provide guidance to managers, users,
and service providers on their individual responsibilities and the specific procedures that should be
followed. Responsibility for handling personal information and ensuring awareness of the data
protection principles should be dealt with in accordance with relevant legislation and regulations.
Appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal information should be
implemented.
Other information
A number of countries have introduced legislation placing controls on the collection, processing, and
transmission of personal data (generally information on living individuals who can be identified from
that information). Depending on the respective national legislation, such controls may impose duties
on those collecting, processing, and disseminating personal information, and may restrict the ability to
transfer that data to other countries.

15.1.5 Prevention of misuse of information processing facilities
Control
Users should be deterred from using information processing facilities for unauthorized purposes.
Implementation guidance
Management should approve the use of information processing facilities. Any use of these facilities
for non-business purposes without management approval (see 6.1.4), or for any unauthorized
purposes, should be regarded as improper use of the facilities. If any unauthorized activity is identified
by monitoring or other means, this activity should be brought to the attention of the individual
manager concerned for consideration of appropriate disciplinary and/or legal action.
Legal advice should be taken before implementing monitoring procedures.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
All users should be aware of the precise scope of their permitted access and of the monitoring in place
to detect unauthorized use. This can be achieved by giving users written authorization, a copy of
which should be signed by the user and securely retained by the organization. Employees of an
organization, contractors, and third party users should be advised that no access will be permitted
except that which is authorized.
At log-on, a warning message should be presented to indicate that the information processing facility
being entered is owned by the organization and that unauthorized access is not permitted. The user has
to acknowledge and react appropriately to the message on the screen to continue with the log-on
process (see 11.5.1).
Other information
The information processing facilities of an organization are intended primarily or exclusively for
business purposes.
Intrusion detection, content inspection, and other monitoring tools may help prevent and detect misuse
of information processing facilities.
Many countries have legislation to protect against computer misuse. It may be a criminal offence to
use a computer for unauthorized purposes.
The legality of monitoring the usage varies from country to country and may require management to
advise all users of such monitoring and/or to obtain their agreement. Where the system being entered
is used for public access (e.g., a public web server) and is subject to security monitoring, a message
should be displayed saying so.

15.1.6 Regulation of cryptographic controls
Control
Cryptographic controls should be used in compliance with all relevant agreements, laws, and
regulations.
Implementation guidance
The following items should be considered for compliance with the relevant agreements, laws, and
regulations:
a) restrictions on import and/or export of computer hardware and software for performing
cryptographic functions;
b) restrictions on import and/or export of computer hardware and software which is designed
to have cryptographic functions added to it;
c) restrictions on the usage of encryption;
d) mandatory or discretionary methods of access by the countries’ authorities to information
encrypted by hardware or software to provide confidentiality of content.
Legal advice should be sought to ensure compliance with national laws and regulations. Before
encrypted information or cryptographic controls are moved to another country, legal advice should
also be taken.

15.2

Compliance with security policies and standards, and technical compliance

Objective: To ensure compliance of systems with organizational security policies and standards.
The security of information systems should be regularly reviewed.
Such reviews should be performed against the appropriate security policies and the technical
platforms and information systems should be audited for compliance with applicable security
implementation standards and documented security controls.

15.2.1 Compliance with security policies and standards
Control
Managers should ensure that all security procedures within their area of responsibility are carried out
correctly to achieve compliance with security policies and standards.
Implementation guidance
Managers should regularly review the compliance of information processing within their area of
responsibility with the appropriate security policies, standards, and any other security requirements.
If any non-compliance is found as a result of the review, managers should:
a) determine the causes of the non-compliance;
b) evaluate the need for actions to ensure that non-compliance do not recur;
c) determine and implement appropriate corrective action;
d) review the corrective action taken.
Results of reviews and corrective actions carried out by managers should be recorded and these
records should be maintained. Managers should report the results to the persons carrying out the
independent reviews (see 6.1.8), when the independent review takes place in the area of their
responsibility.
Other information
Operational monitoring of system use is covered in 10.10.

15.2.2 Technical compliance checking
Control
Information systems should be regularly checked for compliance with security implementation
standards.
Implementation guidance
Technical compliance checking should be performed either manually (supported by appropriate
software tools, if necessary) by an experienced system engineer, and/or with the assistance of
automated tools, which generate a technical report for subsequent interpretation by a technical
specialist.
If penetration tests or vulnerability assessments are used, caution should be exercised as such
activities could lead to a compromise of the security of the system. Such tests should be planned,
documented and repeatable.
Any technical compliance check should only be carried out by competent, authorized persons, or
under the supervision of such persons.
Other information
Technical compliance checking involves the examination of operational systems to ensure that
hardware and software controls have been correctly implemented. This type of compliance checking
requires specialist technical expertise.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Compliance checking also covers, for example, penetration testing and vulnerability assessments,
which might be carried out by independent experts specifically contracted for this purpose. This can
be useful in detecting vulnerabilities in the system and for checking how effective the controls are in
preventing unauthorized access due to these vulnerabilities.
Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments provide a snapshot of a system in a specific state at a
specific time. The snapshot is limited to those portions of the system actually tested during the
penetration attempt(s). Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments are not a substitute for risk
assessment.

15.3

Information systems audit considerations

Objective: To maximize the effectiveness of and to minimize interference to/from the information
systems audit process.
There should be controls to safeguard operational systems and audit tools during information systems
audits.
Protection is also required to safeguard the integrity and prevent misuse of audit tools.

15.3.1 Information systems audit controls
Control
Audit requirements and activities involving checks on operational systems should be carefully planned
and agreed to minimize the risk of disruptions to business processes.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be observed:
a) audit requirements should be agreed with appropriate management;
b) the scope of the checks should be agreed and controlled;
c) the checks should be limited to read-only access to software and data;
d) access other than read-only should only be allowed for isolated copies of system files,
which should be erased when the audit is completed, or given appropriate protection if
there is an obligation to keep such files under audit documentation requirements;
e) resources for performing the checks should be explicitly identified and made available;
f) requirements for special or additional processing should be identified and agreed;
g) all access should be monitored and logged to produce a reference trail; the use of timestamped reference trails should be considered for critical data or systems;
h) all procedures, requirements, and responsibilities should be documented;
i)

the person(s) carrying out the audit should be independent of the activities audited.

15.3.2 Protection of information systems audit tools
Control
Access to information systems audit tools should be protected to prevent any possible misuse or
compromise.
Implementation guidance
Information systems audit tools, e.g. software or data files, should be separated from development and
operational systems and not held in tape libraries or user areas, unless given an appropriate level of
additional protection.

Other information
If third parties are involved in an audit, there might be a risk of misuse of audit tools by these third
parties, and information being accessed by this third party organization. Controls such as 6.2.1 (to
assess the risks) and 9.1.2 (to restrict physical access) can be considered to address this risk, and any
consequences, such as immediately changing passwords disclosed to the auditors, should be taken.
