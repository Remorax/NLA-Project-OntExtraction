Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27004 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.

Introduction

0.1 General
This International Standard provides guidance on the development and use of measures and measurement in
order to assess the effectiveness of an implemented information security management system (ISMS) and
controls or groups of controls, as specified in ISO/IEC 27001.
This would include policy, information security risk management, control objectives, controls, processes and
procedures, and support the process of its revision, helping to determine whether any of the ISMS processes
or controls need to be changed or improved. It needs to be kept in mind that no measurement of controls can
guarantee complete security.
The implementation of this approach constitutes an Information Security Measurement Programme. The
Information Security Measurement Programme will assist management in identifying and evaluating noncompliant and ineffective ISMS processes and controls and prioritizing actions associated with improvement
or changing these processes and/or controls. It may also assist the organization in demonstrating
ISO/IEC 27001 compliance and provide additional evidence for management review and information security
risk management processes.
This International Standard assumes that the starting point for the development of measures and
measurement is a sound understanding of the information security risks that an organization faces, and that
an organization’s risk assessment activities have been performed correctly (i.e. based on ISO/IEC 27005), as
required by ISO/IEC 27001. The Information Security Measurement Programme will encourage an
organization to provide reliable information to relevant stakeholders concerning its information security risks
and the status of the implemented ISMS to manage these risks.
Effectively implemented, the Information Security Measurement Programme would improve stakeholder
confidence in measurement results, and enable the stakeholders to use these measures to effect continual
improvement of information security and the ISMS.
The accumulated measurement results will allow comparison of progress in achieving information security
objectives over a period of time as part of an organization’s ISMS continual improvement process.
0.2 Management overview
ISO/IEC 27001 requires the organization to “undertake regular reviews of the effectiveness of the ISMS taking
into account results from effectiveness measurement” and to “measure the effectiveness of controls to verify
that security requirements have been met”. ISO/IEC 27001 also requires the organization to “define how to
measure the effectiveness of the selected controls or groups of controls and specify how these measures are
to be used to assess control effectiveness to produce comparable and reproducible results”.
The approach adopted by an organization to fulfil the measurement requirements specified in ISO/IEC 27001
will vary based on a number of significant factors, including the information security risks that the organization
faces, its organizational size, resources available, and applicable legal, regulatory and contractual
requirements. Careful selection and justification of the method used to fulfil the measurement requirements
are important to ensure that excessive resources are not devoted to these activities of the ISMS to the
detriment of others. Ideally, ongoing measurement activities are to be integrated into the regular operations of
the organization with minimal additional resource requirements.
This International Standard gives recommendations concerning the following activities as a basis for an
organization to fulfil measurement requirements specified in ISO/IEC 27001:
a) developing measures (i.e. base measures, derived measures and indicators);

implementing and operating an Information Security Measurement Programme;
collecting and analysing data;
developing measurement results;
communicating developed measurement results to the relevant stakeholders;
using measurement results as contributing factors to ISMS-related decisions;
using measurement results to identify needs for improving the implemented ISMS, including its scope,
policies, objectives, controls, processes and procedures; and
h) facilitating continual improvement of the Information Security Measurement Programme.
One of the factors that will impact the organization’s ability to achieve measurement is its size. Generally the
size and complexity of the business in combination with the importance of information security affect the
extent of measurement needed, both in terms of the numbers of measures to be selected and the frequency
of collecting and analysing data. For SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) a less comprehensive information
security measurement program will be sufficient, whereas large enterprises will implement and operate
multiple Information Security Measurement Programmes.
A single Information Security Measurement Programme may be sufficient for small organizations, whereas for
large enterprises the need may exist for multiple Information Security Measurement Programmes.
The guidance provided by this International Standard will result in the production of documentation that will
contribute to demonstrating that control effectiveness is being measured and assessed.

Information security measurement overview

5.1 Objectives of information security measurement
The objectives of information security measurement in the context of an ISMS includes:
a) evaluating the effectiveness of the implemented controls or groups of controls (See “4.2.2 d)” in Figure 1);
b) evaluating the effectiveness of the implemented ISMS (See “4.2.3 b)” in Figure 1);
c) verifying the extent to which identified security requirements have been met (See “4.2.3 c)” in Figure 1);
d) facilitating performance improvement of information security in terms of the organization’s overall
business risks;
e) providing input for management review to facilitate ISMS-related decision making and justify needed
improvements of the implemented ISMS.
Figure 1 illustrates the cyclical input–output relationship of the measurement activities in relation to the PlanDo-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, specified in ISO/IEC 27001. Numbers in each figure represent relevant subclauses of ISO/IEC 27001:2005.

Figure 1 — Measurement inputs and outputs in ISMS PDCA cycle of information security management
The organization should establish measurement objectives based on a number of considerations, including:
a) The role of information security in support of the organization’s overall business activities and the risks
it faces;
b) Applicable legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements;
c) Organizational structure;
d) Costs and benefits of implementing information security measures;
e) Risk acceptance criteria for the organization; and
f) A need to compare several ISMSs within the same organization.
5.2 Information Security Measurement Programme
An organization should establish and manage an Information Security Measurement Programme in order to
achieve the established measurement objectives and adopt the PDCA model within the organization’s overall
measurement activities. An organization should also develop and implement measurement constructs in order
to obtain repeatable, objective and useful results of measurement based on the Information Security
Measurement Model (see 5.4).
The Information Security Measurement Programme and the developed measurement construct should ensure
that an organization effectively achieves objective and repeatable measurement and provides measurement
results for relevant stakeholders to identify needs for improving the implemented ISMS, including its scope,
policies, objectives, controls, processes and procedures.

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

An Information Security Measurement Programme should include the following processes:
a) Measures and measurement development (see Clause 7) ;
b) Measurement operation (see Clause 8);
c) Data analysis and measurement results reporting (see Clause 9); and
d) Information Security Measurement Programme evaluation and improvement (see Clause 10).
The organisational and operational structure of an Information Security Measurement Programme should be
determined by taking into account the scale and complexity of the ISMS of which it is a part. In all cases, roles
and responsibilities for the Information Security Measurement Programme should be explicitly assigned to
competent personnel (see 7.5.8).
The measures selected and implemented by the Information Security Measurement Programme should be
directly related to the operation of an ISMS, other measures, as well as organization’s business processes.
Measurement can be integrated into regular operational activities or performed at regular intervals determined
by ISMS management.
5.3 Success factors
The following are some contributing factors to the success of Information Security Measurement Programme
in facilitating continual ISMS improvement:
a) Management commitment supported by appropriate resources;
b) Existence of ISMS processes and procedures;
c) A repeatable process capable of capturing and reporting meaningful data to provide relevant trends over
a period of time;
d) Quantifiable measures based on ISMS objectives;
e) Easily obtainable data that can be used for measurement;
f) Evaluation of effectiveness of Information Security Measurement Programme and implementation of
identified improvements;
g) Consistent periodic collection, analysis, and reporting of measurement data in a manner that is
meaningful;
h) Use of the measurement results by relevant stakeholders to identify needs for improving the implemented
ISMS, including its scope, policies, objectives, controls, processes and procedures;
i) Acceptance of feedback on measurement results from relevant stakeholders; and
j) Evaluations of the usefulness of measurement results and implementation of identified improvements.
Once successfully implemented, an Information Security Measurement Programme can:
1) Demonstrate an organization’s compliance with applicable legal or regulatory requirements and
contractual obligations;
2) Support identification of previously undetected or unknown information security issues;
3) Assist in satisfying management reporting needs when stating measures for historical and current
activities; and
4) Be used as input into information security risk management process, internal ISMS audits and
management reviews.
5.4 Information security measurement model
NOTE. The concepts of the information security measurement model and measurement constructs adopted in this
International Standard are based on those in ISO/IEC 15939. The term “information product” used in ISO/IEC 15939 is a
synonym with “measurement results” in this International Standard and “measurement process” used in ISO/IEC 15939 is
a synonym with “Measurement Programme” in this International Standard.

5.4.1

Overview

The information security measurement model is a structure linking an information need to the relevant objects
of measurement and their attributes. Objects of measurement may include planned or implemented
processes, procedures, projects and resources.

The information security measurement model describes how the relevant attributes are quantified and
converted to indicators that provide a basis for decision making. Figure 2 depicts the information security
measurement model.

model.

Clause 7 provides detailed information about the individual elements of information security measurement

Subsequent sub-clauses introduce individual elements of the model. They also provide examples of how
these individual elements are used.
The information needs or purpose of measurement used in examples contain in Tables 1 to 4 of the following
sub-clauses is to assess the awareness status of compliance with organization security policy among relevant
personnel (Control objective.A.8.2, and Controls A.8.2.1 and A.8.2.2. of ISO/IEC 27001:2005).
5.4.2

Base measure and measurement method

A base measure is the simplest measure that can be obtained. A base measure results from applying a
measurement method to the attributes selected of an object of measurement. An object of measurement may
have many attributes, only some of which may provide useful values to be assigned to a base measure. A
given attribute may be used for several different base measures.

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

A measurement method is a logical sequence of operations used in quantifying an attribute with respect to a
specified scale. The operation may involve activities such as counting occurrences or observing the passage
of time.
A measurement method can apply attributes to an object of measurement. Examples of an object of
measurement include but are not limited to:
- Performance of controls implemented in the ISMS;
- Status of information assets protected by the controls;
- Performance of processes implemented in the ISMS;
- Behaviour of personnel who are responsible to the implemented ISMS;
- Activities of organizational units responsible for information security; and
- Extent of satisfaction of interested parties.
A measurement method may use measurement objects of measurement and attributes from a variety of
sources, such as:
- Risk analysis and risk assessment results;
- Questionnaires and personal interviews;
- Internal and/or external audits reports;
- Records of events, such as logs, report statistics, and audit trails;
- Incident reports, particularly those that result in the occurrence of an impact;
- Test results, e.g. from penetration testing, social engineering, compliance tools, and security audit tools;
or
- Records from the organization’s information security related procedures and programmes, eg. information
security awareness training results.
Tables 1-4 below present the application of the information security model for the following controls:
“Control 2” refers to control A.8.2.1 Management responsibility of ISO/IEC 27001:2005 (“Management
shall require employees, contractors and third party users to apply security in accordance with
established policies and procedures of the organization”); being implemented as follows: “All
personnel relevant to the ISMS must sign user agreements before being granted access to an
information system”;
“Control 1” refers to control A.8.2.2 “Information security awareness, education and training” of
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 (“All employees of the organization and, where relevant, contractors and third
party users shall receive appropriate awareness training and regular updates in organizational policies
and procedures, as relevant for their job function”); being implemented as follows: “All personnel
relevant to the ISMS must receive information security awareness training before being granted
access to an information system”.
The corresponding measurement constructs are contained in B.1.
NOTE Table 1-4 consists of various columns (Table 1, four columns; Table 2-4, three columns) of which are assigned a
letter designator. Each box within individual columns is assigned a number designator. The combinations of letter and
number designators are used in subsequent boxes to refer to previous boxes. Arrows designate the data flows between
individual elements of the information security measurement model within the specific example.

Table 1 includes an example of the relationships between object of measurement, attribute, measurement
method and base measure for measuring the objects established for implemented controls described above.

Derived measure and measurement function

A derived measure is an aggregate of two or more base measures. A given base measure may serve as input
for several derived measures.
A measurement function is a calculation used to combine base measures together to create a derived
measure.
The scale and unit of the derived measure depends on the scales and units of the base measures from which
it is composed as well as how they are combined by the measurement function.
The measurement function may involve a variety of techniques, such as averaging base measures, applying
weights to base measures, or assigning qualitative values to base measures. The measurement function may
combine base measures using different scales, such as percentages and qualitative assessment results.
An example of the relationship of further elements of the information security measurement model application
i.e. base measure, measurement function and derived measure is presented in Table 2.

Indicators and analytical model

An indicator is a measure that provides an estimate or evaluation of specified attributes derived from an
analytical model with respect to defined information need. Indicators are obtained by applying an analytical
model to a base and/or a derived measure and combining them with decision criteria. The scale and
measurement method affect the choice of analytical techniques used to produce indicators.
An example of the relationships between derived measures, analytical model and indicators for the
information security measurement model application is presented in Table 3.

other visual methods

5.4.5

Measurement results and decision criteria

Measurement results are developed with interpreting applicable indicators based on defined decision criteria
and should be considered in the context of the overall measurement objectives of assessing the ISMS
effectiveness. Decision criteria is used to determine the need for action or further investigation, as well as to
describe the level of confidence in measurement results. Decision criteria may be applied to a series of
indicators, for example to conduct trend analysis based on indicators received at different point in time.
Targets provide detailed performance specifications, applicable to the organization or parts thereof, derived
from the information security objectives such as the ISMS objectives and control objectives, and that need to
be set and met in order to achieve those objectives.
An example of the relationship of final elements of the information security measurement model application
(i.e. indicator, decision criteria and measurement results) is presented in Table 4.

Management responsibilities

6.1 Overview
Management is responsible for establishing the Information Security Measurement Programme, involving
relevant stakeholders (see 7.5.8) in the measurement activities, accepting measurement results as an input
into management review and using measurement result in improvement activities within the ISMS.
To achieve this, management should:
a)
Establish objectives for the Information Security Measurement Programme;
b)
Establish a policy for the Information Security Measurement Programme;
c)
Establish roles and responsibilities for the Information Security Measurement Programme;
d)
Provide adequate resources to perform measurement including personnel, funding, tools and
infrastructure;
e)
Ensure that the objectives of the Information Security Measurement Programme are achieved;
f)
Ensure that tools and equipment used to collect data are maintained properly;
g)
Establish the purpose of measurement for each measurement construct;
h)
Ensure that measurement provides sufficient information to relevant stakeholders with regard to
effectiveness of the ISMS and needs for improving the implemented ISMS, including its scope,
policies, objectives, controls, processes and procedures; and
i)
Ensure that measurement provides sufficient information to relevant stakeholders with regard to
effectiveness of controls or group of controls and needs for improving the implemented controls.
Through the appropriate assignment of measurement roles and responsibilities, management should ensure
measurement results are not influenced by information owners (see 7.5.8). This may be achieved through
segregation of duties or, if this is not possible, through the use of detailed documentation that allows

independent checks.
6.2 Resource management
Management should assign and provide resources to support essential activities of measurement, such as
data collection, analysis, storage, reporting, and distribution. Resource allocations should include the
assignment of:
a) Individuals with responsibility for all aspects of Information Security Measurement Programme;
b) Appropriate financial support; and
c) Appropriate infrastructure support, such as physical infrastructure and tools used to perform the
measurement process.
NOTE
Clause 5.2.1 of ISO/IEC 27001:2005 specifies requirement on the provision of resources for implementation
and operation of an ISMS.

6.3 Measurement training, awareness, and competence
Management should ensure that:
a) The stakeholders (see 7.5.8) are trained adequately for achieving their roles and responsibilities in the
implemented Information Security Measurement Programme, and appropriately qualified to perform their
roles and responsibilities; and
b) The stakeholders understand that their duties include making suggestions for improvements in the
implemented Information Security Measurement Programme.

Measures and measurement development

7.1 Overview
This clause provides guidance on how to develop measures and measurement for the purpose of assessing
the effectiveness of the implemented ISMS and controls or group of controls, and identifying organisationspecific sets of measurement constructs. Activities needed to develop measures and measurement should be
established and documented, including the following:
a) Defining the measurement scope (see 7.2);
b) Identifying an information need (see 7.3);
c) Selecting the object of measurement and its attributes (see 7.4) ;
d) Developing measurement constructs (see 7.5);
e) Applying measurement constructs (see 7.6);
f) Establishing data collection and analysis processes and tools (see 7.7), and
g) Establishing measurement implementation approach and documentation (see 7.8).
When establishing these activities, the organization should take into account financial, human, and
infrastructure (physical and tools) resources.
7.2 Definition of measurement scope
Depending on an organization’s capabilities and resources, the initial scope of an organization’s measurement
activities will be limited to such elements as specific controls, information assets protected by specific controls,
specific activities for information security that are given highest priority by management. Over time, the scope
of measurement activities will be widened to address further elements of the implemented ISMS and controls
or group of controls, taking into account stakeholders’ priorities.
Relevant stakeholders should be identified and should participate in defining the measurement scope. The
relevant stakeholders may be internal or external to the organizational units, such as project managers,
information system managers, or information security decision makers. Specific measurement results
addressing the effectiveness of individual controls or group of controls should be defined and communicated
to relevant stakeholders.

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

The organization may consider limiting the number of measurement results to be reported to decision-makers
within a given time period to ensure their ability to effect improvement of the ISMS based on the reported
measurement results. An excessive number of reported measurement results will impact the ability of the
decision-maker to focus efforts and prioritize future improvement activities. Measurement results should be
prioritized based on the importance of corresponding information needs and associated ISMS objectives.
NOTE
The measurement scope is related to the scope of the ISMS established in accordance with 4.2.1 a) of
ISO/IEC 27001:2005.

7.3 Identification of information need
Each measurement construct should correspond to, at least, one information need. An example of the
information need, describing in starting point as the purpose of measurement and ending with relevant
decision criteria is presented in Annex A.
The following activities should be performed to identify relevant information needs:
a) Examine the ISMS and its processes, such as:
1) ISMS policy and objectives, control objectives and controls;
2) Legal, regulatory, contractual and organizational requirements for information security;
3) The information security risk management process outcomes, as described in ISO/IEC
27001.
b) Prioritize the identified information needs based on criteria, such as:
1) Risk treatment priorities;
2) An organization’s capabilities and resources;
3) Stakeholders’ interests;
4) The information security policy;
5) Information required to meet legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements;
6) The value of the information in relation to the cost of measurement;
c) Select a subset of information required to be addressed in measurement activities from the prioritized
list; and
d) Document and communicate the selected information needs to all relevant stakeholders.
All relevant measures applied to an implemented ISMS, controls or groups of controls should be implemented
based on the selected information needs.
7.4 Object and attribute selection
An object of measurement and its attributes should be identified in the overall context and scope of an ISMS.
It should be noted that an object of measurement can have several applicable attributes.
The object and its attributes to be used by measurement should be selected based on the priority of a
corresponding information needs.
The values to be assigned to a relevant base measure are obtained by applying an appropriate measurement
method to the selected attributes. This selection should also ensure that:
- Relevant base measure and an appropriate measurement method can be identified; and
- Meaningful measurement results can be developed based on the obtained values and developed
measures.
Characteristics of selected attributes determine which type of a measurement method needs to be used to
obtain values to be assigned to base measures (e.g. qualitative or quantitative).
The selected object and attributes should be documented, along with the rationale for the selection.
Data describing the object of measurement and corresponding attributes should be used as the values to be
assigned to base measures. Examples of objects of measurement include but are not limited to:
- Products and services;
- Processes;

-

Applicable assets such as facilities, applications, and information systems as identified in ISO/IEC
27001:2005 (Inventory of assets, A.7.1.1);
Business units;
Geographic locations; and
Third party services.

Attributes should be reviewed to ensure that:
a) Appropriate attributes have been selected for measurement; and
b) Data collection has been defined to ensure a sufficient number of attributes is present to allow for effective
measurement.
Only attributes that are relevant to the corresponding base measure should be selected. Although the
selection of attributes should take into consideration the degree of difficulty in obtaining the attributes to
measure, it should not be made solely upon data being easily obtainable or the attribute being easy to
measure.
7.5 Measurement construct development
7.5.1

Overview

This sub-clause (7.5) addresses measurement construct development from 7.5.2 (measure selection) to 7.5.8
(stakeholders).
7.5.2

Measure selection

Measures that could potentially satisfy the selected information need should be identified. The identified
measures should be defined in sufficient detail to allow for selection of measures to be implemented. Newly
identified measures may involve an adaptation of an existing measure.
NOTE
Identification of base measures is closely related with identification of objects of measurement and their
attributes.

The identified measures that could potentially satisfy the selected information need should be selected.
Context information necessary to interpret or normalize measures also should be considered.
NOTE
Many different combinations of measures (i.e. base measures, derived measures, and indicators) may be
selected to address a specific information need.

The selected measures should reflect the priority of the information needs. Further example criteria that may
be used for the selection of measures include:
- Ease of data collection;
- Availability of human resources to collect and manage data;
- Availability of appropriate tools;
- Number of potentially relevant indicators supported by the base measure;
- Ease of interpretation;
- Number of users of developed measurement results;
- Evidence as to the measure’s fitness for purpose or information need; and
- Costs of collecting, managing, and analysing the data.
7.5.3

Measurement method

For each individual base measure a measurement method should be defined. This measurement method is
used to quantify an object of measurement through transforming the attributes into the value to be assigned to
the base measure.
A measurement method may be subjective or objective. Subjective methods rely on quantification involving
human judgment, while objective methods use quantification based on numerical rules such as counting which
may be implemented via human or automated means.

15

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

The measurement method quantifies the attributes as values by applying an appropriate scale. Each scale
uses units of measurement. Only quantities expressed in the same unit of measurement are directly
comparable.
For each measurement method, verification process should be established and documented. This verification
should ensure a level of confidence in the value that is to be obtained by applying a measurement method to
an attribute of object of measurement and assigned to a base measure. Where necessary to ascertain valid
value, tools used to obtain attributes should be standardized and verified at specified intervals.
The precision of the measurement method should be taken into account and the associated deviation or
variance should be recorded.
A measurement method should be consistent over time so that the values assigned to a base measure taken
at different times are comparable and that the values assigned to a derived measure and an indicator are also
comparable.
7.5.4

Measurement function

For each individual derived measure a measurement function should be defined which is applied to two or
more values assigned to base measures. This measurement function is used to transform the values assigned
to one or more base measures into the value to be assigned to a derived measure. In some cases, a base
measure may contribute directly to the analytical model in addition to a derived measure.
A measurement function (e.g. a calculation) may involve a variety of techniques, such as averaging all values
assigned to base measures, applying weights to values assigned to base measures, or assigning qualitative
values to values assigned to base measures before aggregating them into the value to be assigned to a
derived measure. The measurement function may combine values assigned to base measures using different
scales, such as percentages and qualitative assessment results.
7.5.5

Analytical model

For each indicator, an analytical model should be defined for the purpose of transforming one or more values
assigned to a base and/or a derived measure into the value to be assigned to the indicator.
The analytical model combines relevant measures in a way that produces an output that is meaningful to
stakeholders.
Decision criteria that are applied to an indicator should also be considered when defining the analytical model.
Sometimes an analytical model may be as simple as transforming a single value assigned to a derived
measure into the value to be assigned to an indicator.
7.5.6

Indicators

The values to be assigned to indicators will be produced by aggregating values assigned to the derived
measure and interpreting these values based on the decision criteria. For each indicator that will be reported
to the client a format for indicator’s presentation as a part of reporting formats (see 7.7) should be defined.
Formats for indicator's presentation will visually depict the measures and provide a verbal explanation of the
indicators. Formats for indicator's presentation should be customized to meet the information need of the
client.
7.5.7

Decision criteria

Decision criteria corresponding to each indicator should be defined and documented based on information
security objectives, to provide actionable guidance for stakeholders. This guidance should address the
expectations for progress and the thresholds for initiating improvement actions based on the indicator.

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

Decision criteria establish a target by which success (see 5.3) is measured and provide guidance on
interpreting the indicator in relation to its proximity to the target.
Targets need to be set for each item regarding performance of ISMS processes and controls, achievement of
objectives, and for effectiveness of the ISMS to be evaluated.
Management may decide not to set targets for indicators until the initial data is collected. Once the corrective
actions based on the initial data are identified, appropriate decision criteria and implementation milestones
can be defined that are realistic for a specific ISMS. If decision criteria cannot be established at that point,
management should evaluate whether the object of measurement and corresponding measures are providing
expected value for the organization.
Establishment of decision criteria can be facilitated if historic data that pertains to developed or selected
measures is available. Trends observed in the past will provide insight into ranges of performance that have
existed previously and guide the creation of realistic decision criteria. Decision criteria may be calculated or
based on a conceptual understanding of expected behaviour. Decision criteria may be derived from historical
data, plans, and heuristics, or computed as statistical control limits or statistical confidence limits.
7.5.8

Stakeholders

For each base and/or derived measure appropriate stakeholders should be identified and documented.
Stakeholders may include the following:
a) Client for measurement: the management or other interested parties requesting or requiring
information about the effectiveness of an ISMS, controls or group of controls;
b) Reviewer for measurement: the person or organizational unit that validates that the developed
measurement constructs are appropriate for assessing the effectiveness of an ISMS, controls or
group of controls;
c) Information owner: the person or organizational unit that owns the information about an object of
measurement and attributes and is responsible for the measurement;
d) Information collector: the person or organizational unit responsible for collecting, recording and storing
the data; and
e) Information communicator: the person or organizational unit responsible for analysing data and
communicating measurement results.
7.6 Measurement construct
As a minimum, the measurement construct specification should include the following information:
a) Purpose of measurement;
b) Control objective to be achieved by controls, and specific controls, group of controls and ISMS process to
be measured;
c) Object of measurement;
d) Data to be collected and used;
e) Processes for data collection and analysis;
f) Process for reporting of measurement results, including reporting formats;
g) Roles and responsibilities of relevant stakeholders; and
h) A cycle for reviewing the measurement to ensure their usefulness in relation to an information need.
Annex A provides a generic measurement construct example that incorporates a) to h). Annex B provides
measurement construct examples applied to measuring ISMS processes and controls.
7.7 Data collection, analysis and reporting
Procedures for data collection and analysis, and processes for reporting of developed measurement results
should be established. Supporting tools, measurement equipment and technologies should also be
established, if required. These procedures, tools, measurement equipment and technologies will address the
following activities:
a) Data collection, including data storage and verification (see 8.3). The procedures should identify how
data are to be collected by using measurement method, measurement function and analytical model,
Licensed to Mr. PEDDINTI

17

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

as well as how and where they will be stored together with any context information necessary to
understand and verify the data. Data verification can be performed by inspecting the data against a
checklist which is constructed to verify that missing data are minimal, and that the value to be
assigned to each measure is valid.
NOTE: Verification of values to be assigned to base measures is closely related with verification of measurement
method (see 7.5.3).

b) Data analysis and reporting of developed measurement results. The procedures should specify the
data analysis techniques (see 9.2), and the frequency, format and methods for reporting the
measurement results. The range of tools that may be needed to perform the data analysis should be
identified.
Examples of reporting formats include:
-

Scorecards to provide strategic information by integrating high level indicators;
Executive and operational dashboards less focused on strategic objectives and more tied to the
effectiveness of specific controls and processes;
Reports, from simple and static in nature, such as a list of measures for a given time period, to more
sophisticated cross-tab reports with nested grouping, rolling summaries, and dynamic drill-through or
linking. Reports are best used when the user needs to look at raw data in an easy-to-read format; and
Gauges to represent a dynamic values including alerts, additional graphical elements and labelling of
endpoints.

7.8 Measurement implementation and documentation
The overall approach to measurement should be documented in an implementation plan. The implementation
plan should include the following information as a minimum:
a) Information Security Measurement Programme implementation for the organization;
b) Measurement specification as follows:
1) Organization’s generic measurement construct;
2) Organization’s individual measurement constructs; and
3) Definition of the range and procedures for data collection and data analysis;
c) Calendar plan to perform measurement activities;
d) Records created through performing measurement activities, including collected data and analysis records;
and
e) Reporting formats for measurement results to be reported to management/stakeholders (see ISO/IEC
27001:2005 Clause 7 “Management review”).

Measurement operation

8.1 Overview
Operation of information security measurement involves activities that are essential for ensuring that the
developed measurement results provide accurate information with regard to effectiveness of an implemented
ISMS, controls or group of controls and needs for appropriate improvement actions.
This activity includes the following:
a) Integrating measurement procedures into the overall operation of the ISMS.
b) Collecting, storing and verifying data.
8.2 Procedure integration
The Information Security Measurement Programme should be fully integrated into and used by the ISMS. The
measurement procedures should be coordinated with the operation of the ISMS including:
a) Definition and documentation of roles, authority and responsibility, regarding development,
implementation, and maintenance of information security measurement;

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

b) Collection of data, and, where needed, modifying current operation of the ISMS to accommodate data
generation and collection activities;
c) Communication of the changes in data collection activities to relevant stakeholders;
d) Maintenance of information collectors’ competency and understanding of the required types of data, data
collection tools, and data collection procedures;
e) Development of policies and procedures defining the use of measurement within the organization,
dissemination of the measurement information, auditing and review of the Information Security
Measurement Programme;
f) Integration of data analysis and reporting into the relevant processes to ensure their regular performance;
g) Monitoring, reviewing and evaluating measurement results;
h) Establishment of a process for phasing measures out and adding new measures to ensure that they
evolve with the organization; and
i)
Establishment of a process for determining the useful life of historical data for trend analysis.
8.3 Data collection, storage and verification
Data collection, storage and verification activities include the following:
a) Collecting required data within regular intervals using a designated measurement method;
b) Documenting the data collection, including:
1) date, time, and location of data collection;
2) information collector;
3) information owner;
4) any issues that occurred during data collection that may be useful;
5) information for data verification and measurement validation; and
c) Verifying collected data against measures selection criteria and measurement constructs validation
criteria.
The collected data and any necessary context information should be consolidated and stored in a recording
format conducive to data analysis.

9

Data analysis and measurement results reporting

9.1 Overview
Collected data should be analysed to develop measurement results and developed measurement results
should be communicated.
This activity includes the following:
a) Analysing data and developing measurement results; and
b) Communicating measurement results to relevant stakeholders.
9.2 Analyse data and develop measurement results
Collected data should be analysed and interpreted in terms of the decision criteria. The data may be
aggregated, transformed, or re-coded prior to analysis. During this task, data should be processed to produce
the indicators. A number of analysis techniques can be applied. The depth of the analysis should be
determined by the nature of the data and the information need.
NOTE
Guidance for performing statistical analysis may be found ISO/TR 10017 (Guidance on statistical techniques
for ISO 9001).

The data analysis results should be interpreted. The person analysing the results (communicator) should be
able to draw some initial conclusions based on the results. However, since the communicator(s) might not be
directly involved in the technical and management processes, such conclusions need to be reviewed by other
stakeholders. All interpretations should take into account the context of the measures.
Data analysis should identify gaps between the expected and actual measurement results of an implemented
ISMS, controls or groups of controls. Identified gaps will point to needs for improving the implemented ISMS,
including its scope, policies, objectives, controls, processes and procedures.

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

Those indicators that demonstrate non-compliance or poor performance should be identified and may be
classified as follows:
a) Risk treatment plan failure to implement or sufficiently implement, operate, and manage controls or ISMS
processes (e.g., controls and ISMS processes can be bypassed by threats);
b) Risk assessment failure:
1) Controls or ISMS processes are ineffective because they are insufficient to either counter
estimated threats (e.g. because likelihood of threats was underestimated); or counter new threats;
2) Controls or ISMS processes are not implemented, because of overlooked threats.
Reports that are used to communicate measurement results to relevant stakeholders should be prepared
using appropriate reporting formats (see 7.7) in accordance with the Information Security Measurement
Programme implementation plan.
The conclusions of the analysis should be reviewed by relevant stakeholders to ensure proper interpretation of
the data. The results of data analysis should be documented for communication to stakeholders.
9.3 Communicate measurement results
Information communicator should determine how to communicate the information security measurement
results, such as:
- Which measurement results are to be reported internally and externally;
- Listings of measures corresponding to individual stakeholders, and interested parties;
- Specific measurement results to be provided, and the type of presentation, tailored to the needs of
each group; and
- Means for obtaining feedback from the stakeholders to be used for evaluating the usefulness of
measurement results and the effectiveness of Information Security Measurement Programme.
Measurement results should be communicated to a variety of internal stakeholders including but not limited to:
- Clients for measurement (see 7.5.8);
- Information owners (see 7.5.8);
- Personnel in charge of the information security risk management, especially where failures of risk
assessment are identified; and
- Personnel who are responsible to the identified areas in need of improvement.
The organization may be requested in some cases to distribute reports of measurement results to external
parties, including regulatory authorities, shareholders, customers, and suppliers. It is recommended that
reports on measurement results to be distributed externally only contain data appropriate for external release
and are approved by management and relevant stakeholders before being released.

10 Information Security Measurement Programme Evaluation and Improvement
10.1 Overview
The organization should evaluate at planned intervals the following:
a) Effectiveness of the implemented Information Security Measurement Programme to ensure that it:
1) Produces measurement results in an effective manner;
2) Is executed as planned;
3) Addresses changes in the implemented ISMS and/or controls;
4) Addresses changes in the environment (e.g., requirements, legislation, or technology); and
b) Usefulness of developed measurement results to ensure that they satisfy relevant information needs.
Management should specify the frequency of such evaluation, plan periodic revisions and establish the
mechanisms for making such revisions possible (see clause 7.2 of ISO/IEC 27001:2005).
The relevant activities should be as follows:
1) To identify evaluation criteria for the Information Security Measurement Programme (see 10.2);
2) To monitor, review, and evaluate measurement (see 10.3); and
3) To implement improvements (see 10.4).

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

10.2 Evaluation criteria identification for the Information Security Measurement Programme
The organization should define criteria for evaluating effectiveness of the Information Security Measurement
Programme as well as usefulness of developed measurement results. The criteria should be defined at the
beginning of Information Security Measurement Programme implementation, taking into account the context of
the technical and business objectives of the organization.
The most likely criteria when organizations should evaluate and improve implemented Information Security
Measurement Programme are:
- Changes in business objectives of the organization;
- Changes to legal or regulatory requirements and contractual obligations on information security;
- Changes in organization’s requirements on information security;
- Changes in information security risks to the organization;
- Increased availability of more refined or suitable data and/or methods to collect data for measurement
purposes; and
- Changes to the object of measurement and/or its attributes;
The following criteria may be applied to evaluate the developed measurement results:
a) Measurement results are:
1) Easy to understand;
2) Communicated in a timely manner; and
3) Objective, comparable and reproducible.
b) Established processes for developing measurement results are:
1) Well defined;
2) Easy to operate; and
3) Followed properly.
c) Measurement results are useful for improving information security.
d) Measurement results address corresponding information needs.
10.3 Monitor, review, and evaluate the Information Security Measurement Programme
The organization should monitor, review and evaluate its Information Security Measurement Programme
against the established criteria (see 10.2).
The organization should identify potential needs for improvements of the Information Security Measurement
Programme, including:
a) Revising or removing adopted measurement constructs that are no longer appropriate; and
b) Re-allocating resources to support the Information Security Measurement Programme.
The organization should also identify potential needs for improvements of the implemented ISMS, including its
scope, policies, objectives, controls, processes and procedures; and document management decisions to
allow for comparison and trend analysis during subsequent reviews.
The results of this evaluation and the identified potential needs for improvements should be communicated to
relevant stakeholders to allow decision-making regarding necessary improvements.
The organization should ensure that feedback is sought from stakeholders on the results of this evaluation
and the identified potential needs for improvements. The organization should understand that the feedback is
one of inputs regarding effectiveness of the Information Security Measurement Programme.
10.4 Implement improvements
The organization should ensure that relevant stakeholders identify needed improvements of the Information
Security Measurement Programme (see clause 7.3 e) of ISO/IEC 27001:2005). The identified improvements
should be approved by management. The approved plans should be documented and communicated to
appropriate stakeholders.
The organization should ensure that the approved improvements of the Information Security Measurement
Programme are implemented as planned.
The organization may apply project management techniques to accomplish the improvements.

Object of Measurement and Attributes
Object (entity) that is characterised through the measurement of its
Object of Measurement
attributes. An object may include processes, plans, projects,
resources, and systems, or system components.
Property or characteristic of an object of measurement that can be
Attribute
distinguished quantitatively or qualitatively by human or automated
means.
Base Measure Specification (for each base measure [1...n])
A base measure is defined in terms of an attribute and the specified
measurement method for quantifying it (e.g., number of trained
Base Measure
personnel, number of sites, cumulative cost to date). As data is
collected, a value is assigned to a base measure.
Logical sequence of operations used in quantifying an attribute with
Measurement Method
respect to a specified scale.
Depending on the nature of the operations used to quantify an
attribute, two types of method may be distinguished:
Type of Measurement
- Subjective: quantification involving human judgment.
Method
- Objective: quantification based on numerical rules such as
counting.
Ordered set of values or categories to which the base measure’s
Scale
attribute is mapped.
Type of Scale
Depending on the nature of the relationship between values on the
scale, four types of scale are commonly defined: Nominal, Ordinal,
Interval and Ratio.
Unit of Measurement
Particular quantity, defined and adopted by convention, with which any
other quantity of the same kind can be compared to express the ratio
of the two quantities as a number.
Derived Measure Specification
A measure that is derived as a function of two or more base
Derived Measure
measures.
Algorithm or calculation performed to combine two or more base
measures. The scale and unit of the derived measure depend on the
Measurement Function
scales and units of the base measures from which it is composed of as
well as how they are combined by the function.

Indicator Specification
Measure that provides an estimate or evaluation of specified attributes
derived from an analytical model with respect to a defined information
need. Indicators are the basis for analysis and decision making.
Algorithm or calculation combining one or more base and/or derived
measures with associated decision criteria. It is based on an
understanding of, or assumptions about, the expected relationship
between the base and/or the derived measure and/or their behaviour
over time. An analytical model produces estimates or evaluations
relevant to a defined information need.

Decision Criteria Specification
Control objective is achieved and no action required if the resulting
ratio is above 0.9. If the resulting ratio is between 0.8 and 0.9 the
control objective is not achieved, but positive trend indicates
improvement. If the resulting ratio is below 0.8 immediate action
should be taken.

Decision Criteria
Measurement Results

Interpretation for the indicator a) should be as follows:
y The organization criteria for compliance with organizational
password policy are met satisfactorily at the ratios>0.9.
y The organization criteria for compliance with organizational
password policy are met unsatisfactorily at [0.8≤the ratio≤0.9].
y The organization criteria for compliance with organizational
password policy are not met at the ratio<0.8.
Interpretation of Indicators b) should be as follows :
y Upward trend indicates improved compliance, downward trend
indicate deteriorating compliance.
y The degree of trend change may provide insights into the
effectiveness of implemented controls.
y Negative trend may require further controls such as awareness, or
technical means to force for selection of robust passwords or
changing passwords periodically.
y Positive trends should be examined to estimate necessary terms to
meet password policy from current ratio.
The effect/impact of the criteria not being met is increased risk of
confidentiality breaches.
Potential causes of deviation include lack of security awareness,
technical implementation deficiencies, and lack of time for
implementing on all IT systems.

Control objective is achieved and no action required if the resulting
ratio is above 0.9. If the resulting ratio is between 0.8 and 0.9 the
control objective is not achieved, but positive trend indicates
improvement. If the resulting ratio is below 0.8 immediate action
should be taken.

Decision Criteria
Measurement Results

Interpretation for the indicator 1 should be as follows:
y The organization criteria for compliance with organizational
password policy are met satisfactorily at the ratios>0.9.
y The organization criteria for compliance with organizational
password policy are met unsatisfactorily at [0.8≤the ratio≤0.9].
y The organization criteria for compliance with organizational
password policy are not met at the ratio<0.8.
Interpretation of Indicators b) should be as follows :
y Upward trend indicates improved compliance, downward trend
indicate deteriorating compliance.
y The degree of trend change may provide insights into the
effectiveness of implemented controls.
y Negative trend may require further controls such as awareness, or
technical means to force for selection of robust passwords or
changing passwords periodically.
y Positive trends should be examined to estimate necessary terms to
meet password policy from current ratio.
The effect/impact of the criteria not being met is increased risk of
password compromise that may lead to unauthorized system access.
Potential causes of deviation include lack of security awareness,
technical implementation deficiencies, and lack of time for
implementing on all IT systems.

nonconformities with the ISMS requirements in order to prevent
recurrence.

Control (1)/process (1)

The documented procedure for corrective action shall define
requirements for:
a) identifying nonconformities;
b) determining the causes of nonconformities;
c) evaluating the need for actions to ensure that nonconformities do
not recur;
d) determining and implementing the corrective action needed;
e) recording results of action taken (see 4.3.3); and
f) reviewing of corrective action taken.
(implemented)
……..
The organization determines the corrective actions required, and
issues the corrective action report documenting information regarding
non-conformity, its cause, and the due date for the corrective action to
be taken.
Upon receiving the report, the manager responsible for the area where
the non-conformity is detected is required to ensure that actions are
taken without undue delay to eliminate detected non-conformities and
their causes.
If corrective action is not implemented as required, the cause of nonimplementation has to be identified, as well as alternatives to the
original corrective action that would be determined to be appropriate.
The actions taken with the corresponding date and results should be
documented. If the corrective action is not implemented as planned
the reason and the alternative action have to be documented. The
report should be provided to Information Security Manager.

should be presented in comparison with previous indicators so that the
trend in corrective action implementation can be examined.
Measurement Results
Interpretation for the indicator a) and b) should be as follows:
Planned corrective actions must be implemented unless the
organization’s priorities have changed that would result in the need to
implement different corrective actions or redirection of resources
allocated to corrective action implementation. If over 40% of corrective
actions are not implemented regardless of the reason, management
action is required. If over 20% of corrective actions are not
implemented without a good reason, management action is required.
Corrective actions that were not implemented should be examined to
identify reasons for non-implementation. Depending on the overall
percentage not implemented and reasons for non implementation,
further action may be required.
Indicator Interpretation

Reporting Formats

Interpretation for the indicator c) should be as follows:
A trend in corrective action implementation should be examined for
any overall deterioration in performance or for significant improvement
in performance.
If percentage of implemented corrective action has been steadily
declining for the last 2 reporting periods, management action is
required regardless of the breakdown in the reasons for noncompliance.
The effects/impact of criteria not being met is potential lack of
continual ISMS improvement.
The potential causes may include lack of resources, incorrect
planning, and lack of critical personnel and management commitment.

if it fails, it should be still over 0.5 to conclude the least achievement.
With regard to indicator b), Computed confidence limits based on the
standard deviation indicate the likelihood that an actual result close to
the average participation rate will be achieved. Very wide confidence
limits suggest a potentially large departure and the need for
contingency planning to deal with this outcome.

Measurement Results
Interpretation for the indicator a) should be as follows:
The organization’s criteria for managing information security within the
organization thorough management review have been met
satisfactorily at 0.7≤ the ratio≤1.1 ;
The organization criteria have been met unsatisfactorily at [0.5≤the
ratio<0.7 or the ratio>1.1]. This result may indicate possible lack of
management commitment and may require corrective action.
Subsequent measurement results should be monitored and evaluated
for improvement.
The organization criteria are not met at [0≤ the ratio<0.5]. This result
indicates lack of management commitment and requires immediate
intervention to implement an appropriate corrective action. Senior
management should be notified of the result. The ratio close to 0 may
indicate lack of senior management commitment. If ISMS managers
do not view ISMS management reviews as a priority, they may be
influenced by senior management.

Indicator Interpretation

The effects/impact of the criteria not being met is potential lack of a
continual and effective management review process.
Potential causes of deviation in indicator b) may include incorrect
planning, insufficient commitment of Managers responsible for an
ISMS, conflicting priorities and/or overwork effecting ISMS Managers.
