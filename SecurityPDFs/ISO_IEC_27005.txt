Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27005 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.
This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO/IEC 27005:2008) which has been technically
revised.

Introduction
This International Standard provides guidelines for information security risk management in an organization,
supporting in particular the requirements of an information security management (ISMS) according to
ISO/IEC 27001. However, this International Standard does not provide any specific method for information
security risk management. It is up to the organization to define their approach to risk management, depending
for example on the scope of the ISMS, context of risk management, or industry sector. A number of existing
methodologies can be used under the framework described in this International Standard to implement the
requirements of an ISMS.
This International Standard is relevant to managers and staff concerned with information security risk
management within an organization and, where appropriate, external parties supporting such activities.

3.2
control
measure that is modifying risk (3.9)
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE 1
Controls for information security include any process, policy, procedure, guideline, practice or organizational
structure, which can be administrative, technical, management, or legal in nature which modify information security risk.
NOTE 2

Controls may not always exert the intended or assumed modifying effect.

NOTE 3

Control is also used as a synonym for safeguard or countermeasure.

3.3
event
occurrence or change of a particular set of circumstances
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE 1

An event can be one or more occurrences, and can have several causes.

NOTE 2

An event can consist of something not happening.

NOTE 3

An event can sometimes be referred to as an “incident” or “accident”.

3.4
external context
external environment in which the organization seeks to achieve its objectives
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE

External context can include:
⎯

the cultural, social, political, legal, regulatory, financial, technological, economic, natural and
competitive environment, whether international, national, regional or local;

⎯

key drivers and trends having impact on the objectives of the organization; and

⎯

relationships with, and perceptions and values of, external stakeholders.

3.6
level of risk
magnitude of a risk (3.9), expressed in terms of the combination of consequences (3.1) and their likelihood
(3.7)
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
3.7
likelihood
chance of something happening
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE 1
In risk management terminology, the word “likelihood” is used to refer to the chance of something happening,
whether defined, measured or determined objectively or subjectively, qualitatively or quantitatively, and described using
general terms or mathematically (such as a probability or a frequency over a given time period).
NOTE 2
The English term “likelihood” does not have a direct equivalent in some languages; instead, the equivalent of
the term “probability” is often used. However, in English, “probability” is often narrowly interpreted as a mathematical term.
Therefore, in risk management terminology, “likelihood” is used with the intent that it should have the same broad
interpretation as the term “probability” has in many languages other than English.

3.8
residual risk
risk (3.9) remaining after risk treatment (3.17)
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE 1

Residual risk can contain unidentified risk.

NOTE 2

Residual risk can also be known as “retained risk”.

3.9
risk
effect of uncertainty on objectives
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE 1

An effect is a deviation from the expected — positive and/or negative.

NOTE 2
Objectives can have different aspects (such as financial, health and safety, information security, and
environmental goals) and can apply at different levels (such as strategic, organization-wide, project, product and process).
NOTE 3
these.

Risk is often characterized by reference to potential events (3.3) and consequences (3.1), or a combination of

NOTE 4
Information security risk is often expressed in terms of a combination of the consequences of an information
security event and the associated likelihood (3.9) of occurrence.
NOTE 5
Uncertainty is the state, even partial, of deficiency of information related to, understanding or knowledge of, an
event, its consequence, or likelihood.
NOTE 6
Information security risk is associated with the potential that threats will exploit vulnerabilities of an information
asset or group of information assets and thereby cause harm to an organization.

3.10
risk analysis

on an issue prior to making a decision or determining a direction on that issue. Consultation is:
⎯

a process which impacts on a decision through influence rather than power; and

⎯

an input to decision making, not joint decision making.

3.13
risk criteria
terms of reference against which the significance of a risk (3.9) is evaluated
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE 1

Risk criteria are based on organizational objectives, and external and internal context.

Background

A systematic approach to information security risk management is necessary to identify organizational needs
regarding information security requirements and to create an effective information security management
system (ISMS). This approach should be suitable for the organization´s environment, and in particular should
be aligned with overall enterprise risk management. Security efforts should address risks in an effective and
timely manner where and when they are needed. Information security risk management should be an integral
part of all information security management activities and should be applied both to the implementation and
the ongoing operation of an ISMS.
Information security risk management should be a continual process. The process should establish the
external and internal context, assess the risks and treat the risks using a risk treatment plan to implement the
recommendations and decisions. Risk management analyses what can happen and what the possible
consequences can be, before deciding what should be done and when, to reduce the risk to an acceptable
level.
Information security risk management should contribute to the following:


Risks being identified



Risks being assessed in terms of their consequences to the business and the likelihood of their
occurrence



The likelihood and consequences of these risks being communicated and understood



Priority order for risk treatment being established



Priority for actions to reduce risks occurring



Stakeholders being involved when risk management decisions are made and kept informed of the risk
management status





Risks and the risk management process being monitored and reviewed regularly



Information being captured to improve the risk management approach



Managers and staff being educated about the risks and the actions taken to mitigate them

The information security risk management process can be applied to the organization as a whole, any discrete
part of the organization (e.g. a department, a physical location, a service), any information system, existing or
planned or particular aspects of control (e.g. business continuity planning).

Overview of the information security risk management process

A high level view of the risk management process is specified in ISO 31000 and shown in Figure 1.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Figure 2 shows how this International Standard applies this risk management process.
The information security risk management process consists of context establishment (Clause 7), risk
assessment (Clause 8), risk treatment (Clause 9), risk acceptance (Clause 10), risk communication and
consultation (Clause 11), and risk monitoring and review (Clause 12).

Figure 2 — Illustration of an information security risk management process
As Figure 2 illustrates, the information security risk management process can be iterative for risk assessment
and/or risk treatment activities. An iterative approach to conducting risk assessment can increase depth and
detail of the assessment at each iteration. The iterative approach provides a good balance between
minimizing the time and effort spent in identifying controls, while still ensuring that high risks are appropriately
assessed.
The context is established first. Then a risk assessment is conducted. If this provides sufficient information to
effectively determine the actions required to modify the risks to an acceptable level then the task is complete
and the risk treatment follows. If the information is insufficient, another iteration of the risk assessment with

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

revised context (e.g. risk evaluation criteria, risk acceptance criteria or impact criteria) will be conducted,
possibly on limited parts of the total scope (see Figure 2, Risk Decision Point 1).
The effectiveness of the risk treatment depends on the results of the risk assessment.
Note that risk treatment involves a cyclical process of:
•
•
•
•

assessing a risk treatment;
deciding whether residual risk levels are acceptable;
generating a new risk treatment if risk levels are not acceptable; and
assessing the effectiveness of that treatment

It is possible that the risk treatment will not immediately lead to an acceptable level of residual risk. In this
situation, another iteration of the risk assessment with changed context parameters (e.g. risk assessment, risk
acceptance or impact criteria), if necessary, may be required, followed by further risk treatment (see Figure 2,
Risk Decision Point 2).
The risk acceptance activity has to ensure residual risks are explicitly accepted by the managers of the
organization. This is especially important in a situation where the implementation of controls is omitted or
postponed, e.g. due to cost.
During the whole information security risk management process it is important that risks and their treatment
are communicated to the appropriate managers and operational staff. Even before the treatment of the risks,
information about identified risks can be very valuable to manage incidents and may help to reduce potential
damage. Awareness by managers and staff of the risks, the nature of the controls in place to mitigate the risks
and the areas of concern to the organization assist in dealing with incidents and unexpected events in the
most effective manner. The detailed results of every activity of the information security risk management
process and from the two risk decision points should be documented.
ISO/IEC 27001 specifies that the controls implemented within the scope, boundaries and context of the ISMS
need to be risk based. The application of an information security risk management process can satisfy this
requirement. There are many approaches by which the process can be successfully implemented in an
organization. The organization should use whatever approach best suits their circumstances for each specific
application of the process.
In an ISMS, establishing the context, risk assessment, developing risk treatment plan and risk acceptance are
all part of the “plan” phase. In the “do” phase of the ISMS, the actions and controls required to reduce the risk
to an acceptable level are implemented according to the risk treatment plan. In the “check” phase of the ISMS,
managers will determine the need for revisions of the risk assessment and risk treatment in the light of
incidents and changes in circumstances. In the ”act” phase, any actions required, including additional
application of the information security risk management process, are performed.
The following table summarizes the information security risk management activities relevant to the four
phases of the ISMS process:

Implementation guidance for context establishment elements needed to support an ISMS is further discussed in
Clauses 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 below.
NOTE
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 does not use the term “context”. However, all of Clause 7 relates to the requirements
“define the scope and boundaries of the ISMS” [4.2.1 a)], “define an ISMS policy” [4.2.1 b)] and “define the risk
assessment approach” [4.2.1 c)], specified in ISO/IEC 27001:2005.

Output: The specification of basic criteria, the scope and boundaries, and the organization for the information
security risk management process.

7.2

Basic Criteria

7.2.1

Risk management approach

Depending on the scope and objectives of the risk management, different approaches can be applied. The
approach might also be different for each iteration.
An appropriate risk management approach should be selected or developed that addresses basic criteria such
as: risk evaluation criteria, impact criteria, risk acceptance criteria.
Additionally, the organization should assess whether necessary resources are available to:





Perform risk assessment and establish a risk treatment plan
Define and implement policies and procedures, including implementation of the controls selected
Monitor controls
Monitor the information security risk management process

NOTE
See also ISO/IEC 27001:2005 (Clause 5.2.1) concerning the provision of resources for the implementation
and operation of an ISMS.

7.2.2

Risk evaluation criteria

Risk evaluation criteria should be developed for evaluating the organization's information security risk
considering the followings:




The strategic value of the business information process
The criticality of the information assets involved
Legal and regulatory requirements, and contractual obligations




Operational and business importance of availability, confidentiality and integrity
Stakeholders expectations and perceptions, and negative consequences for goodwill and reputation

Additionally, risk evaluation criteria can be used to specify priorities for risk treatment.
7.2.3

Impact criteria

Impact criteria should be developed and specified in terms of the degree of damage or costs to the
organization caused by an information security event considering the following:








Level of classification of the impacted information asset
Breaches of information security (e.g. loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability)
Impaired operations (internal or third parties)
Loss of business and financial value
Disruption of plans and deadlines
Damage of reputation
Breaches of legal, regulatory or contractual requirements

NOTE
See also ISO/IEC 27001:2005 [Clause 4.2.1 d) 4] concerning the impact criteria identification for losses of
confidentiality, integrity and availability.

7.2.4

Risk acceptance criteria

Risk acceptance criteria should be developed and specified. Risk acceptance criteria often depend on the
organization's policies, goals, objectives and the interests of stakeholders.
An organization should define its own scales for levels of risk acceptance. The following should be considered
during development:





Risk acceptance criteria may include multiple thresholds, with a desired target level of risk, but provision
for senior managers to accept risks above this level under defined circumstances
Risk acceptance criteria may be expressed as the ratio of estimated profit (or other business benefit) to
the estimated risk
Different risk acceptance criteria may apply to different classes of risk, e.g. risks that could result in noncompliance with regulations or laws may not be accepted, while acceptance of high risks may be allowed
if this is specified as a contractual requirement
Risk acceptance criteria may include requirements for future additional treatment, e.g. a risk may be
accepted if there is approval and commitment to take action to reduce it to an acceptable level within a
defined time period

Risk acceptance criteria may differ according to how long the risk is expected to exist, e.g. the risk may be
associated with a temporary or short term activity. Risk acceptance criteria should be set up considering the
following:







Business criteria
Legal and regulatory aspects
Operations
Technology
Finance
Social and humanitarian factors

NOTE
Risk acceptance criteria correspond to “criteria for accepting risks and identify the acceptable level of risk”
specified in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Clause 4.2.1 c) 2).

7.3

Scope and boundaries

The organization should define the scope and boundaries of information security risk management.
The scope of the information security risk management process needs to be defined to ensure that all relevant
assets are taken into account in the risk assessment. In addition, the boundaries need to be identified
[see also ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Clause 4.2.1 a)] to address those risks that might arise through these
boundaries.
Information about the organization should be collected to determine the environment it operates in and its
relevance to the information security risk management process.
When defining the scope and boundaries, the organization should consider the following information:













The organization's strategic business objectives, strategies and policies
Business processes
The organization’s functions and structure
Legal, regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to the organization
The organization's information security policy
The organization’s overall approach to risk management
Information assets
Locations of the organization and their geographical characteristics
Constraints affecting the organization
Expectation of stakeholders
Socio-cultural environment
Interfaces (i.e. information exchange with the environment)

Additionally, the organization should provide justification for any exclusion from the scope.
Examples of the risk management scope may be an IT application, IT infrastructure, a business process, or a
defined part of an organization.
NOTE
The scope and boundaries of the information security risk management is related to the scope and boundaries
of the ISMS required in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 4.2.1 a).

Further information can be found in Annex A.

7.4

Organization for information security risk management

The organization and responsibilities for the information security risk management process should be set up
and maintained. The following are the main roles and responsibilities of this organization:







Development of the information security risk management process suitable for the organization
Identification and analysis of the stakeholders
Definition of roles and responsibilities of all parties both internal and external to the organization
Establishment of the required relationships between the organization and stakeholders, as well as
interfaces to the organization's high level risk management functions (e.g. operational risk management),
as well as interfaces to other relevant projects or activities
Definition of decision escalation paths
Specification of records to be kept

This organization should be approved by the appropriate managers of the organization.
NOTE
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 requires determination and provision of the resources needed to establish, implement,
operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve an ISMS [5.2.1 a)]. The organization for risk management operations may
be regarded as one of the resources required by ISO/IEC 27001:2005.

Information security risk assessment

8.1

General description of information security risk assessment

NOTE

Risk assessment activity is referred to as process in ISO/IEC 27001:2005.

Input: Basic criteria, the scope and boundaries, and the organization for the information security risk
management process being established.
Action: Risks should be identified, quantified or qualitatively described, and prioritized against risk evaluation
criteria and objectives relevant to the organization.
Implementation guidance:
A risk is a combination of the consequences that would follow from the occurrence of an unwanted event and
the likelihood of the occurrence of the event. Risk assessment quantifies or qualitatively describes the risk and
enables managers to prioritize risks according to their perceived seriousness or other established criteria.
Risk assessment consists of the following activities:




Risk Identification (clause 8.2)
Risk analysis (clause 8.3)
Risk evaluation (clause 8.4)

Risk assessment determines the value of the information assets, identifies the applicable threats and
vulnerabilities that exist (or could exist), identifies the existing controls and their effect on the risk identified,
determines the potential consequences and finally prioritizes the derived risks and ranks them against the risk
evaluation criteria set in the context establishment.
Risk assessment is often conducted in two (or more) iterations. First a high level assessment is carried out to
identify potentially high risks that warrant further assessment. The next iteration can involve further in-depth
consideration of potentially high risks revealed in the initial iteration. Where this provides insufficient
information to assess the risk then further detailed analyses are conducted, probably on parts of the total
scope, and possibly using a different method.
It is up to the organization to select its own approach to risk assessment based on the objectives and the aim
of the risk assessment.
Discussion on information security risk assessment approaches can be found in Annex E.
Output: A list of assessed risks prioritized according to risk evaluation criteria.

8.2
8.2.1

Risk identification
Introduction to risk identification

The purpose of risk identification is to determine what could happen to cause a potential loss, and to gain
insight into how, where and why the loss might happen. The steps described in the following subclauses of 8.2
should collect input data for the risk analysis activity.
Risk identification should include risks whether or not their source is under the control of the organization,
even though the risk source or cause may not be evident.
NOTE
Activities described in subsequent clauses may be conducted in a different order depending on the
methodology applied.

8.2.2

Identification of assets

Input: Scope and boundaries for the risk assessment to be conducted, list of constituents with owners,
location, function, etc.
Action: The assets within the established scope should be identified (relates to ISO/IEC 27001:2005,
Clause 4.2.1 d) 1)).
Implementation guidance:
An asset is anything that has value to the organization and which therefore requires protection. For the
identification of assets it should be borne in mind that an information system consists of more than hardware
and software.
Asset identification should be performed at a suitable level of detail that provides sufficient information for the
risk assessment. The level of detail used on the asset identification will influence the overall amount of
information collected during the risk assessment. The level can be refined in further iterations of the risk
assessment.
An asset owner should be identified for each asset, to provide responsibility and accountability for the asset.
The asset owner may not have property rights to the asset, but has responsibility for its production,
development, maintenance, use and security as appropriate. The asset owner is often the most suitable
person to determine the asset’s value to the organization (see 8.3.2 for asset valuation).
The review boundary is the perimeter of assets of the organization defined to be managed by the information
security risk management process.
More information on the identification and valuation of assets as related to information security can be found in
Annex B.
Output: A list of assets to be risk-managed, and a list of business processes related to assets and their
relevance.
8.2.3

Identification of threats

Input: Information on threats obtained from incident reviewing, asset owners, users and other sources,
including external threat catalogues.
Action: Threats and their sources should be identified (relates to ISO/IEC 27001:2005, Clause 4.2.1 d) 2)).
Implementation guidance:
A threat has the potential to harm assets such as information, processes and systems and therefore
organizations. Threats may be of natural or human origin, and could be accidental or deliberate. Both
accidental and deliberate threat sources should be identified. A threat may arise from within or from outside
the organization. Threats should be identified generically and by type (e.g. unauthorized actions, physical
damage, technical failures) and then where appropriate individual threats within the generic class identified.
This means no threat is overlooked, including the unexpected, but the volume of work required is limited.
Some threats may affect more than one asset. In such cases they may cause different impacts depending on
which assets are affected.
Input to the threat identification and estimation of the likelihood of occurrence (see 8.3.3) may be obtained
from the asset owners or users, from human resources staff, from facility management and information
security specialists, physical security experts, legal department and other organizations including legal bodies,
weather authorities, insurance companies and national government authorities. Aspects of environment and
culture should also be considered when addressing threats.

Internal experience from incidents and past threat assessments should be considered in the current
assessment. It might be worthwhile to consult other threat catalogues (maybe specific to an organization or
business) to complete the list of generic threats, where relevant. Threat catalogues and statistics are available
from industry bodies, national governments, legal bodies, insurance companies etc.
When using threat catalogues, or the results of earlier threat assessments, one should be aware that there is
continual change of relevant threats, especially if the business environment or information systems change.
More information on threat types can be found in Annex C.
Output: A list of threats with the identification of threat type and source.
8.2.4

Identification of existing controls

Input: Documentation of controls, risk treatment implementation plans.
Action: Existing and planned controls should be identified.
Implementation guidance:
Identification of existing controls should be made to avoid unnecessary work or cost, e.g. in the duplication of
controls. In addition, while identifying the existing controls, a check should be made to ensure that the controls
are working correctly – a reference to already existing ISMS audit reports should limit the time expended in
this task. If a control does not work as expected, this may cause vulnerabilities. Consideration should be given
to the situation where a selected control (or strategy) fails in operation and therefore complementary controls
are required to address the identified risk effectively. In an ISMS, according to ISO/IEC 27001, this is
supported by the measurement of control effectiveness. A way to estimate the effect of the control is to see
how it reduces the threat likelihood and ease of exploiting the vulnerability, or impact of the incident.
Management reviews and audit reports also provide information about the effectiveness of existing controls.
Controls that are planned to be implemented according to the risk treatment implementation plans should be
considered in the same way like those already implemented.
An existing or planned control might be identified as ineffective, or not sufficient, or not justified. If not justified
or not sufficient, the control should be checked to determine whether it should be removed, replaced by
another, more suitable control, or whether it should stay in place, for example, for cost reasons.
For the identification of existing or planned controls, the following activities can be helpful:





Reviewing documents containing information about the controls (for example, risk treatment
implementation plans). If the processes of information security management are well documented all
existing or planned controls and the status of their implementation should be available;
Checking with the people responsible for information security (e.g. information security officer and
information system security officer, building manager or operations manager) and the users as to which
controls are really implemented for the information process or information system under consideration;
Conducting an on-site review of the physical controls, comparing those implemented with the list of what
controls should be there, and checking those implemented as to whether they are working correctly and
effectively, or
Reviewing results of audits

Output: A list of all existing and planned controls, their implementation and usage status.
8.2.5

Identification of vulnerabilities

Input: A list of known threats, lists of assets and existing controls.
Action: Vulnerabilities that can be exploited by threats to cause harm to assets or to the organization should
be identified (relates to ISO/IEC 27001:2005, Clause 4.2.1 d) 3)).

15

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Implementation guidance:
Vulnerabilities may be identified in following areas:









Organization
Processes and procedures
Management routines
Personnel
Physical environment
Information system configuration
Hardware, software or communications equipment
Dependence on external parties

The presence of a vulnerability does not cause harm in itself, as there needs to be a threat present to exploit
it. A vulnerability that has no corresponding threat may not require the implementation of a control, but should
be recognized and monitored for changes. It should be noted that an incorrectly implemented or
malfunctioning control or control being used incorrectly could itself be a vulnerability. A control can be effective
or ineffective depending on the environment in which it operates. Conversely, a threat that does not have a
corresponding vulnerability may not result in a risk.
Vulnerabilities can be related to properties of the asset that can be used in a way, or for a purpose, other than
that intended when the asset was purchased or made. Vulnerabilities arising from different sources need to be
considered, for example, those intrinsic or extrinsic to the asset.
Examples of vulnerabilities and methods for vulnerability assessment can be found in Annex D.
Output: A list of vulnerabilities in relation to assets, threats and controls; a list of vulnerabilities that do not
relate to any identified threat for review.
8.2.6

Identification of consequences

Input: A list of assets, a list of business processes, and a list of threats and vulnerabilities, where appropriate,
related to assets and their relevance.
Action: The consequences that losses of confidentiality, integrity and availability may have on the assets
should be identified (see ISO/IEC 27001:2005 4.2.1 d) 4)).
Implementation guidance:
A consequence can be loss of effectiveness, adverse operating conditions, loss of business, reputation,
damage, etc.
This activity identifies the damage or consequences to the organization that could be caused by an incident
scenario. An incident scenario is the description of a threat exploiting a certain vulnerability or set of
vulnerabilities in an information security incident (see ISO/IEC 27002:2005, Clause 13). The impact of the
incident scenarios is to be determined considering impact criteria defined during the context establishment
activity. It may affect one or more assets or part of an asset. Thus assets may have assigned values both for
their financial cost and because of the business consequences if they are damaged or compromised.
Consequences may be of a temporary nature or may be permanent as in the case of the destruction of an
asset.
NOTE

ISO/IEC 27001:2005 describes the occurrence of incident scenarios as “security failures".

Organizations should identify the operational consequences of incident scenarios in terms of (but not limited
to):

8.3

Risk analysis

8.3.1

Risk analysis methodologies

Risk analysis may be undertaken in varying degrees of detail depending on the criticality of assets, extent of
vulnerabilities known, and prior incidents involving in the organization. A risk analysis methodology may be
qualitative or quantitative, or a combination of these, depending on the circumstances. In practice, qualitative
analysis is often used first to obtain a general indication of the level of risk and to reveal the major risks. Later
it may be necessary to undertake more specific or quantitative analysis on the major risks because it is usually
less complex and less expensive to perform qualitative than quantitative analysis.
The form of analysis should be consistent with the risk evaluation criteria developed as part of establishing the
context.
Further details of analysis methodologies are now described:
(a) Qualitative risk analysis:
Qualitative risk analysis uses a scale of qualifying attributes to describe the magnitude of potential
consequences (e.g. Low, Medium and High) and the likelihood that those consequences will occur. An
advantage of qualitative analysis is its ease of understanding by all relevant personnel while a disadvantage is
the dependence on subjective choice of the scale.
These scales can be adapted or adjusted to suit the circumstances and different descriptions may be used for
different risks. Qualitative risk analysis may be used:




As an initial screening activity to identify risks that require more detailed analysis
Where this kind of analysis is appropriate for decisions
Where the numerical data or resources are inadequate for a quantitative risk analysis

Qualitative analysis should use factual information and data where available.
(b) Quantitative risk analysis:
Quantitative risk analysis uses a scale with numerical values (rather than the descriptive scales used in
qualitative risk analysis) for both consequences and likelihood, using data from a variety of sources. The
quality of the analysis depends on the accuracy and completeness of the numerical values and the validity of
the models used. Quantitative risk analysis in most cases uses historical incident data, providing the
advantage that it can be related directly to the information security objectives and concerns of the
organization. A disadvantage is the lack of such data on new risks or information security weaknesses. A
disadvantage of the quantitative approach may occur where factual, auditable data is not available thus
creating an illusion of worth and accuracy of the risk assessment.
The way in which consequences and likelihood are expressed and the ways in which they are combined to
provide a level of risk will vary according to the type of risk and the purpose for which the risk assessment
output is to be used. The uncertainty and variability of both consequences and likelihood should be
considered in the analysis and communicated effectively.

8.3.2

Assessment of consequences

Input: A list of identified relevant incident scenarios, including identification of threats, vulnerabilities, affected
assets, consequences to assets and business processes.
Action: The business impact upon the organization that might result from possible or actual information
security incidents should be assessed, taking into account the consequences of a breach of information
security such as loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability of the assets (relates to ISO/IEC 27001:2005,
Clause 4.2.1 e) 1)).
Implementation Guidance:
After identifying all assets under review, values assigned to these assets should be taken into account while
assessing the consequences.
The business impact value can be expressed in qualitative and quantitative forms, but any method of
assigning monetary value may generally provide more information for decision making and hence facilitate a
more efficient decision making process.
Asset valuation begins with classification of assets according to their criticality, in terms of the importance of
assets to fulfilling the business objectives of the organization. Valuation is then determined using two
measures:



the replacement value of the asset: the cost of recovery cleanup and replacing the information (if at all
possible), and
the business consequences of loss or compromise of the asset, such as the potential adverse business
and/or legal or regulatory consequences from the disclosure, modification, non-availability and/or
destruction of information, and other information assets

This valuation can be determined from a business impact analysis. The value, determined by the
consequence for business, is usually significantly higher than the simple replacement cost, depending on the
importance of the asset to the organization in meeting its business objectives.
Asset valuation is a key factor in the impact assessment of an incident scenario, because the incident may
affect more than one asset (e.g. dependent assets), or only a part of an asset. Different threats and
vulnerabilities will have different impacts on assets, such as a loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability.
Assessment of consequences is thus related to asset valuation based on the business impact analysis.
Consequences or business impact may be determined by modelling the outcomes of an event or set of
events, or by extrapolation from experimental studies or past data.
Consequences may be expressed in terms of monetary, technical or human impact criteria, or other criteria
relevant to the organization. In some cases, more than one numerical value is required to specify
consequences for different times, places, groups or situations.
Consequences in time and finance should be measured with the same approach used for threat likelihood and
vulnerability. Consistency has to be maintained on the quantitative or the qualitative approach.
More information both on asset valuation and impact assessment can be found in Annex B.
Output: A list of assessed consequences of an incident scenario expressed with respect to assets and impact
criteria.
8.3.3

Assessment of incident likelihood

Input: A list of identified relevant incident scenarios, including identification of threats, affected assets,
exploited vulnerabilities and consequences to assets and business processes. Furthermore, lists of all existing
and planned controls, their effectiveness, implementation and usage status.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Action: The likelihood of the incident scenarios should be assessed (relates to ISO/IEC 27001:2005,
Clause 4.2.1 e) 2)).
Implementation guidance:
After identifying the incident scenarios, it is necessary to assess the likelihood of each scenario and impact
occurring, using qualitative or quantitative analysis techniques. This should take account of how often the
threats occur and how easily the vulnerabilities may be exploited, considering:








experience and applicable statistics for threat likelihood
for deliberate threat sources: the motivation and capabilities, which will change over time, and resources
available to possible attackers, as well as the perception of attractiveness and vulnerability of assets for a
possible attacker
for accidental threat sources: geographical factors e.g. proximity to chemical or petroleum plants, the
possibility of extreme weather conditions, and factors that could influence human errors and equipment
malfunction
vulnerabilities, both individually and in aggregation
existing controls and how effectively they reduce vulnerabilities

For instance, an information system may have a vulnerability to the threats of masquerading of user identity
and misuse of resources. The vulnerability of masquerading of user identity may be high because of lack of
user authentication. On the other hand, the likelihood of misuse of resources may be low, despite lack of user
authentication, because ways to misuse resources are limited.
Depending on the need for accuracy, assets could be grouped, or it might be necessary to split assets into
their elements and relate the scenarios to the elements. For example, across geographical locations, the
nature of threats to the same types of assets may change, or the effectiveness of existing controls may vary.
Output: Likelihood of incident scenarios (quantitative or qualitative).
8.3.4

Level of risk determination

Input: A list of incident scenarios with their consequences related to assets and business processes and their
likelihood (quantitative or qualitative).
Action: The level of risk should be determined for all relevant incident scenarios (relates to
ISO/IEC 27001:2005, Clause 4.2.1 e) 4)).
Implementation guidance:
Risk analysis assigns values to the likelihood and the consequences of a risk. These values may be
quantitative or qualitative. Risk analysis is based on assessed consequences and likelihood. Additionally, it
can consider cost benefit, the concerns of stakeholders, and other variables, as appropriate for risk
evaluation. The estimated risk is a combination of the likelihood of an incident scenario and its consequences.
Examples of different information security risk analysis methods or approaches can be found in Annex E.
Output: A list of risks with value levels assigned.

8.4

Risk evaluation

Input: A list of risks with value levels assigned and risk evaluation criteria.
Action: Level of risks should be compared against risk evaluation criteria and risk acceptance criteria (relates
to ISO/IEC 27001:2005, Clause 4.2.1 e) 4)).

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Implementation guidance:
The nature of the decisions pertaining to risk evaluation and risk evaluation criteria that will be used to make
those decisions would have been decided when establishing the context. These decisions and the context
should be revisited in more detail at this stage when more is known about the particular risks identified. To
evaluate risks, organizations should compare the estimated risks (using selected methods or approaches as
discussed in Annex E) with the risk evaluation criteria defined during the context establishment.
Risk evaluation criteria used to make decisions should be consistent with the defined external and internal
information security risk management context and take into account the objectives of the organization and
stakeholder views etc. Decisions as taken in the risk evaluation activity are mainly based on the acceptable
level of risk. However, consequences, likelihood, and the degree of confidence in the risk identification and
analysis should be considered as well. Aggregation of multiple low or medium risks may result in much higher
overall risks and need to be addressed accordingly.
Considerations should include:


Information security properties: if one criterion is not relevant for the organization (e.g. loss of
confidentiality), then all risks impacting this criterion may not be relevant



The importance of the business process or activity supported by a particular asset or set of assets: if the
process is determined to be of low importance, risks associated with it should be given a lower
consideration than risks that impact more important processes or activities

Risk evaluation uses the understanding of risk obtained by risk analysis to make decisions about future
actions. Decisions should include:



Whether an activity should be undertaken
Priorities for risk treatment considering estimated levels of risks

During the risk evaluation stage, contractual, legal and regulatory requirements are factors that should be
taken into account in addition to the estimated risks.
Output: A list of risks prioritized according to risk evaluation criteria in relation to the incident scenarios that
lead to those risks.

Information security risk treatment

9.1

General description of risk treatment

Input: A list of risks prioritized according to risk evaluation criteria in relation to the incident scenarios that lead
to those risks.
Action: Controls to reduce, retain, avoid, or share the risks should be selected and a risk treatment plan
defined.
Implementation guidance:
There are four options available for risk treatment: risk modification (see 9.2), risk retention (see 9.3), risk
avoidance (see 9.4) and risk sharing (see 9.5).
NOTE

ISO/IEC 27001:2005 4.2.1. f) 2) uses the term “accepting risk” instead of “risk retention”.

Figure 3 — The risk treatment activity
Risk treatment options should be selected based on the outcome of the risk assessment, the expected cost
for implementing these options and the expected benefits from these options.
When large reductions in risks may be obtained with relatively low expenditure, such options should be
implemented. Further options for improvements may be uneconomic and judgement needs to be exercised as
to whether they are justifiable.
In general, the adverse consequences of risks should be made as low as reasonably practicable and
irrespective of any absolute criteria. Managers should consider rare but severe risks. In such cases, controls
that are not justifiable on strictly economic grounds may need to be implemented (for example, business
continuity controls considered to cover specific high risks).

The four options for risk treatment are not mutually exclusive. Sometimes the organization can benefit
substantially by a combination of options such as reducing the likelihood of risks, reducing their
consequences, and sharing or retaining any residual risks.
Some risk treatments can effectively address more than one risk (e.g. information security training and
awareness). A risk treatment plan should be defined which clearly identifies the priority ordering in which
individual risk treatments should be implemented and their timeframes. Priorities can be established using
various techniques, including risk ranking and cost-benefit analysis. It is the organization’s managers’
responsibility to decide the balance between the costs of implementing controls and the budget assignment.
The identification of existing controls may determine that existing controls exceed current needs, in terms of
cost comparisons, including maintenance. If removing redundant or unnecessary controls is considered
(especially if the controls have high maintenance costs), information security and cost factors should be taken
into account. Since controls may influence each other, removing redundant controls might reduce the overall
security in place. In addition, it may be cheaper to leave redundant or unnecessary controls in place than to
remove them.
Risk treatment options should be considered taking into account:



How risk is perceived by affected parties
The most appropriate ways to communicate to those parties

Context establishment (see 7.2 – Risk evaluation criteria) provides information on legal and regulatory
requirements with which the organization needs to comply. The risk to organizations is failure to comply and
treatment options to limit this possibility should be implemented. All constraints - organizational, technical,
structural etc. - that are identified during the context establishment activity should be taken into account during
the risk treatment.
Once the risk treatment plan has been defined, residual risks need to be determined. This involves an update
or re-iteration of the risk assessment, taking into account the expected effects of the proposed risk treatment.
Should the residual risk still not meet the organization's risk acceptance criteria, a further iteration of risk
treatment may be necessary before proceeding to risk acceptance. More information can be found in
ISO/IEC 27002:2005, Clause 0.3.
Output: Risk treatment plan and residual risks subject to the acceptance decision of the organization’s
managers.

9.2

Risk modification

Action: The level of risk should be managed by introducing, removing or altering controls so that the residual
risk can be reassessed as being acceptable.
Implementation guidance:
Appropriate and justified controls should be selected to meet the requirements identified by the risk
assessment and risk treatment. This selection should take account of the risk acceptance criteria as well as
legal, regulatory and contractual requirements. This selection should also take account of cost and timeframe
for implementation of controls, or technical, environmental and cultural aspects. It is often possible to lower
the total cost of ownership of a system with properly selected information security controls.
In general, controls may provide one or more of the following types of protection: correction, elimination,
prevention, impact minimization, deterrence, detection, recovery, monitoring and awareness. During control
selection it is important to weigh the cost of acquisition, implementation, administration, operation, monitoring,
and maintenance of the controls against the value of the assets being protected. Furthermore, the return on
investment in terms of risk reduction and potential to exploit new business opportunities afforded by certain
controls should be considered. Additionally, consideration should be given to specialized skills that may be
needed to define and implement new controls or modify existing ones.
ISO/IEC 27002 provides detailed information on controls.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

There are many constraints that can affect the selection of controls. Technical constraints such as
performance requirements, manageability (operational support requirements) and compatibility issues may
hamper the use of certain controls or could induce human error either nullifying the control, giving a false
sense of security or even increasing the risk beyond not having the control (e.g. requiring complex passwords
without proper training, leading to users writing passwords down). Moreover, it could be the case that a control
would affect performance. Managers should try to identify a solution that satisfies performance requirements
while guaranteeing sufficient information security. The result of this step is a list of possible controls, with their
cost, benefit, and priority of implementation.
Various constraints should be taken into account when selecting controls and during implementation.
Typically, the following are considered:












Time constraints
Financial constraints
Technical constraints
Operational constrains
Cultural constraints
Ethical constraints
Environmental constraints
Legal constraints
Ease of use
Personnel constraints
Constraints for integrating new and existing controls

More information on the constraints for risk modification can be found in Annex F.

9.3

Risk retention

Action: The decision on retaining the risk without further action should be taken depending on risk evaluation.
NOTE
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 4.2.1 f 2) “knowingly and objectively accepting risks, providing they clearly satisfy the
organization’ policies and the criteria for accepting risks” describes the same activity.

Implementation guidance:
If the level of risk meets the risk acceptance criteria, there is no need for implementing additional controls and
the risk can be retained.

9.4

Risk avoidance

Action: The activity or condition that gives rise to the particular risk should be avoided.
Implementation guidance:
When the identified risks are considered too high, or the costs of implementing other risk treatment options
exceed the benefits, a decision may be made to avoid the risk completely, by withdrawing from a planned or
existing activity or set of activities, or changing the conditions under which the activity is operated. For
example, for risks caused by nature it may be most cost effective alternative to physically move the
information processing facilities to a place where the risk does not exist or is under control.

9.5

Risk sharing

Action: The risk should be shared with another party that can most effectively manage the particular risk
depending on risk evaluation.
Implementation guidance:
Risk sharing involves a decision to share certain risks with external parties. Risk sharing can create new risks
or modify existing, identified risks. Therefore, additional risk treatment may be necessary.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Sharing can be done by insurance that will support the consequences, or by sub-contracting a partner whose
role will be to monitor the information system and take immediate actions to stop an attack before it makes a
defined level of damage.
It should be noted that it may be possible to share the responsibility to manage risk but it is not normally
possible to share the liability of an impact. Customers will usually attribute an adverse impact as being the
fault of the organization.

10 Information security risk acceptance
Input: Risk treatment plan and residual risk assessment subject to the acceptance decision of the
organization’s managers.
Action: The decision to accept the risks and responsibilities for the decision should be made and formally
recorded (this relates to ISO/IEC 27001:2005 paragraph 4.2.1 h)).
Implementation guidance:
Risk treatment plans should describe how assessed risks are to be treated to meet risk acceptance criteria
(see Clause 7.2 Risk acceptance criteria). It is important for responsible managers to review and approve
proposed risk treatment plans and resulting residual risks, and record any conditions associated with such
approval.
Risk acceptance criteria can be more complex than just determining whether or not a residual risk falls above
or below a single threshold.
In some cases the level of residual risk may not meet risk acceptance criteria because the criteria being
applied do not take into account prevailing circumstances. For example, it might be argued that it is necessary
to accept risks because the benefits accompanying the risks are very attractive, or because the cost of risk
modification is too high. Such circumstances indicate that risk acceptance criteria are inadequate and should
be revised if possible. However, it is not always possible to revise the risk acceptance criteria in a timely
manner. In such cases, decision makers may have to accept risks that do not meet normal acceptance
criteria. If this is necessary, the decision maker should explicitly comment on the risks and include a
justification for the decision to override normal risk acceptance criteria.
Output: A list of accepted risks with justification for those that do not meet the organization’s normal risk
acceptance criteria.

11 Information security risk communication and consultation
Input: All risk information obtained from the risk management activities (see Figure 2).
Action: Information about risk should be exchanged and/or shared between the decision-maker and other
stakeholders.
Implementation guidance:
Risk communication is an activity to achieve agreement on how to manage risks by exchanging and/or
sharing information about risk between the decision-makers and other stakeholders. The information includes,
but is not limited to the existence, nature, form, likelihood, severity, treatment, and acceptability of risks.
Effective communication among stakeholders is important since this may have a significant impact on
decisions that need to be made. Communication will ensure that those responsible for implementing risk
management, and those with a vested interest understand the basis on which decisions are made and why
particular actions are required. Communication is bi-directional.

Perceptions of risk can vary due to differences in assumptions, concepts and the needs, issues and concerns
of stakeholders as they relate to risk or the issues under discussion. Stakeholders are likely to make
judgments on the acceptability of risk based on their perception of risk. This is especially important to ensure
that the stakeholders’ perceptions of risk, as well as their perceptions of benefits, can be identified and
documented and the underlying reasons clearly understood and addressed.
Risk communication should be carried out in order to achieve the following:










To provide assurance of the outcome of the organization’s risk management
To collect risk information
To share the results from the risk assessment and present the risk treatment plan
To avoid or reduce both occurrence and consequence of information security breaches due to the lack of
mutual understanding among decision makers and stakeholders
To support decision-making
To obtain new information security knowledge
To co-ordinate with other parties and plan responses to reduce consequences of any incident
To give decision makers and stakeholders a sense of responsibility about risks
To improve awareness

An organization should develop risk communication plans for normal operations as well as for emergency
situations. Therefore, risk communication activity should be performed continually.
The co-ordination between major decision makers and stakeholders may be achieved by the formation of a
committee where debate about risks, their prioritization and appropriate treatment, and acceptance can take
place.
It is important to cooperate with the appropriate public relations or communications unit within the organization
to coordinate all tasks related to risk communication. This is crucial in the event of crisis communication
actions, for example, in response to particular incidents.
Output: Continual understanding of the organization’s information security risk management process and
results.

12 Information security risk monitoring and review
12.1 Monitoring and review of risk factors
Input: All risk information obtained from the risk management activities (see Figure 2).
Action: Risks and their factors (i.e. value of assets, impacts, threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood of occurrence)
should be monitored and reviewed to identify any changes in the context of the organization at an early stage,
and to maintain an overview of the complete risk picture.
Implementation guidance:
Risks are not static. Threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood or consequences may change abruptly without any
indication. Therefore constant monitoring is necessary to detect these changes. This may be supported by
external services that provide information regarding new threats or vulnerabilities.
Organizations should ensure that the following are continually monitored:






New assets that have been included in the risk management scope
Necessary modification of asset values, e.g. due to changed business requirements
New threats that could be active both outside and inside the organization and that have not been
assessed
Possibility that new or increased vulnerabilities could allow threats to exploit these new or changed
vulnerabilities
Identified vulnerabilities to determine those becoming exposed to new or re-emerging threats




Increased impact or consequences of assessed threats, vulnerabilities and risks in aggregation resulting
in an unacceptable level of risk
Information security incidents

New threats, vulnerabilities or changes in likelihood or consequences can increase risks previously assessed
as low ones. Review of low and accepted risks should consider each risk separately, and all such risks as an
aggregate as well, to assess their potential accumulated impact. If risks do not fall into the low or acceptable
risk category, they should be treated using one or more of the options considered in Clause 9.
Factors that affect the likelihood and consequences of threats occurring could change, as could factors that
affect the suitability or cost of the various treatment options. Major changes affecting the organization should
be reason for a more specific review. Therefore, the risk monitoring activities should be regularly repeated and
the selected options for risk treatment should be reviewed periodically.
The outcome of risk monitoring activities may be input to other risk review activities. The organization should
review all risks regularly, and when major changes occur (according to ISO/IEC 27001:2005, Clause 4.2.3)).
Output: Continual alignment of the management of risks with the organization’s business objectives, and with
risk acceptance criteria.

12.2 Risk management monitoring, review and improvement
Input: All risk information obtained from the risk management activities (see Figure 2).
Action: The information security risk management process should be continually monitored, reviewed and
improved as necessary and appropriate.
Implementation guidance:
Ongoing monitoring and review is necessary to ensure that the context, the outcome of the risk assessment
and risk treatment, as well as management plans, remain relevant and appropriate to the circumstances.
The organization should make sure that the information security risk management process and related
activities remain appropriate in the present circumstances and are followed. Any agreed improvements to the
process or actions necessary to improve compliance with the process should be notified to the appropriate
managers to have assurance that no risk or risk element is overlooked or underestimated and that the
necessary actions are taken and decisions are made to provide a realistic risk understanding and ability to
respond.
Additionally, the organization should regularly verify that the criteria used to measure the risk and its elements
are still valid and consistent with business objectives, strategies and policies, and that changes to the
business context are taken into consideration adequately during the information security risk management
process. This monitoring and review activity should address (but not be limited to):










Legal and environmental context
Competition context
Risk assessment approach
Asset value and categories
Impact criteria
Risk evaluation criteria
Risk acceptance criteria
Total cost of ownership
Necessary resources

The organization should ensure that risk assessment and risk treatment resources are continually available to
review risk, to address new or changed threats or vulnerabilities, and to advise management accordingly.

Annex A
(informative)
Defining the scope and boundaries of
the information security risk management process

A.1 Study of the organization
Evaluate the organization The study of the organization recalls the characteristic elements defining the identity
of an organization. This concerns the purpose, business, missions, values and strategies of this organization.
These should be identified together with the elements contributing to their development (e.g. subcontracting).
The difficulty of this activity lies in understanding exactly how the organization is structured. Identifying its real
structure will provide an understanding of the role and importance of each division in achieving the
organization's objectives.
For example, the fact that the information security manager reports to the top managers rather than IT
managers may indicate top managers' involvement in information security.
The organization's main purpose The main purpose of an organization can be defined as the reason why it
exists (its field of activity, its market segment, etc.).
Its business The organization's business, defined by the techniques and know-how of its employees, enables
it to accomplish its missions. It is specific to the organization's field of activity and often defines its culture.
Its mission The organization achieves its purpose by accomplishing its mission. To identify its missions, the
services provided and/or products manufactured should be identified in relation to the end users.
Its values Values are major principles or a well-defined code of conduct applied to the exercise of a business.
This may concern the personnel, relations with outside agents (customers, etc.), the quality of products
supplied or services provided.
Take the example of an organization whose purpose is public service, whose business is transport and whose
missions include transporting children to and from school. Its values may be the punctuality of the service and
safety during transport.
Structure of the organization There are different types of structure:



Divisional structure: each division is placed under the authority of a division manager responsible for the
strategic, administrative and operational decisions concerning his unit
Functional structure: functional authority is exercised on the procedures, the nature of the work and
sometimes the decisions or planning (e.g. production, IT, human resources, marketing, etc.)

Remarks:




A division within an organization with divisional structure may be organised as a functional structure and
vice versa
An organization may be said to have a matrix structure if it has elements of both types of structure
In any organizational structure the following levels can be distinguished:
•
the decision-making level (definition of strategic orientations);
•
the leadership level (co-ordination and management);
•
the operational level (production and support activities).

Organization chart The organization's structure is represented schematically in an organization chart. This
representation should highlight the lines of reporting and delegation of authority, but should also include other
relationships, which, even if they are not based on any formal authority, are nevertheless lines of information
flow.
The organization’s strategy This requires a formal expression of the organization's guiding principles. The
organization’s strategy determines the direction and development needed in order to benefit from the issues at
stake and of the major changes it is planning.

A.2 List of the constraints affecting the organization
All the constraints affecting the organization and determining its information security orientation should be
taken into account. Their source may be within the organization in which case it has some control over them
or outside the organization and therefore generally non-negotiable. Resource constraints (budget, personnel)
and emergency constraints are among the most important ones.
The organization sets its objectives (concerning its business, behaviour, etc.) committing it to a certain path,
possibly over a long period. It defines what it wants to become and the means that will need to be
implemented. In specifying this path, the organization takes into account developments in techniques and
know-how, the expressed wishes of users, customers, etc. This objective can be expressed in the form of
operating or development strategies with the aim, for example, of cutting operating costs, improving quality of
service, etc.
These strategies probably include information and the information system (IS), which assist in their
application. Consequently, characteristics concerning the identity, mission and strategies of the organization
are fundamental elements in the analysis of the problem since the breach of an information security aspect
could result in rethinking these strategic objectives. In addition, it is essential that proposals for information
security requirements remain consistent with the rules, uses and means in force in the organization.
The list of constraints includes but is not limited to:
Constraints of a political nature
These may concern government administrations, public institutions or more generally any organization that
has to apply government decisions. They are usually decisions concerning strategic or operational orientation
made by a government division or decision-making body and should be applied.
For example, the computerization of invoices or administrative documents introduces information security
problems.
Constraints of a strategic nature
Constraints can arise from planned or possible changes to the organization's structures or orientation. They
are expressed in the organization's strategic or operational plans.
For example, international co-operation in the sharing of sensitive information may necessitate agreements
concerning secure exchange.
Territorial constraints
The organization's structure and/or purpose may introduce specific constraints such as the distribution of sites
over the entire national territory or abroad.
Examples include postal services, embassies, banks, subsidiaries of a large industrial group, etc.

29

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Constraints arising from the economic and political climate
An organization's operation may be profoundly changed by specific events such as strikes or national and
international crises.
For example, some services should be able to continue even during a serious crisis.
Structural constraints
The nature of an organization's structure (divisional, functional or other) may lead to a specific information
security policy and security organization adapted to the structure.
For example, an international structure should be able to reconcile security requirements specific to each
country.
Functional constraints
Functional constraints arise directly from the organization's general or specific missions.
For example, an organization that operates around the clock should ensure its resources are continuously
available.
Constraints concerning personnel
The nature of these constraints varies considerably. They are linked to: level of responsibility, recruitment,
qualification, training, security awareness, motivation, availability, etc.
For example, the entire personnel of a defence organization should have authorisation to handle highly
confidential information.
Constraints arising from the organization's calendar
These constraints may result from restructuring or setting up new national or international policies imposing
certain deadlines.
For example, the creation of a security division.
Constraints related to methods
Methods appropriate to the organization's know-how will need to be imposed for aspects such as project
planning, specifications, development and so on.
For example, a typical constraint of this kind is the need to incorporate the organization's legal obligations into
the security policy.
Constraints of a cultural nature
In some organizations work habits or the main business have led to a specific “culture” within the organization,
one which may be incompatible with the security controls. This culture is the personnel's general reference
framework and may be determined by many aspects, including education, instruction, professional
experience, experience outside work, opinions, philosophy, beliefs, social status, etc.
Budgetary constraints
The recommended security controls may sometimes have a very high cost. While it is not always appropriate
to base security investments on cost-effectiveness, economic justification is generally required by the
organization’s financial department.
For example, in the private sector and some public organizations, the total cost of security controls should not
exceed the cost of the potential consequences of the risks. Top management should therefore assess and
take calculated risks if they want to avoid excessive security costs.

A.3 List of the legislative and regulatory references applicable to the organization
The regulatory requirements applicable to the organization should be identified. These may be laws, decrees,
specific regulations in the organization's field or internal and/or external regulations. This also concerns
contracts and agreements and more generally any obligations of a legal or regulatory nature.

A.4 List of the constraints affecting the scope
By identifying the constraints it is possible to list those that have an impact on the scope and determine which
are nevertheless amenable to action. They are added to, and may possibly amend, the organization's
constraints determined above. The following paragraphs present a non-exhaustive list of possible types of
constraints.
Constraints arising from pre-existing processes
Application projects are not necessarily developed simultaneously. Some depend on pre-existing processes.
Even though a process can be broken down into sub-processes, the process is not necessarily influenced by
all the sub-processes of another process.
Technical constraints
Technical constraints, relating to infrastructure, generally arise from installed hardware and software, and
rooms or sites housing the processes:








Files (requirements concerning organization, media management, management of access rules, etc.)
General architecture (requirements concerning topology (centralised, distributed, client-server), physical
architecture, etc.)
Application software (requirements concerning specific software design, market standards, etc.);
Package software (requirements concerning standards, level of evaluation, quality, compliance with
norms, security, etc.)
Hardware (requirements concerning standards, quality, compliance with norms, etc.)
Communication networks (requirements concerning coverage, standards, capacity, reliability, etc.)
Building infrastructure (requirements concerning civil engineering, construction, high voltages, low
voltages, etc.)

Financial constraints
The implementation of security controls is often restricted by the budget that the organization can commit.
However, the financial constraint should still to be the last to be considered as the budget allocation for
security can be negotiated on the basis of the security study.
Environmental constraints
Environmental constraints arise from the geographical or economic environment in which the processes are
implemented: country, climate, natural risks, geographical situation, economic climate, etc.
Time constraints
The time required for implementing security controls should be considered in relation to the ability to upgrade
the information system; if the implementation time is very long, the risks for which the control was designed
may have changed. Time is a determining factor for selecting solutions and priorities.
Constraints related to methods
Methods appropriate to the organization's know-how should be used for project planning, specifications,
development and so on.

Annex B
(informative)
Identification and valuation of assets and impact assessment

B.1 Examples of asset identification
To perform asset valuation, an organization first needs to identify its assets (at an appropriate level of detail). Two
kinds of assets can be distinguished:


The primary assets:
 Business processes & activities
 Information



The supporting assets (on which the primary elements of the scope rely) of all types:
 Hardware
 Software
 Network
 Personnel
 Site
 Organization’s structure

B.1.1 The identification of primary assets
To describe the scope more accurately, this activity consists in identifying the primary assets (business
processes and activities, information). This identification is carried out by a mixed work group representative
of the process (managers, information systems specialists and users).
The primary assets are usually the core processes and information of the activity in the scope. Other primary
assets such as the organization's processes can also be considered, which will be more appropriate for
drawing up an information security policy or a business continuity plan. Depending on the purpose, some
studies will not require an exhaustive analysis of all the elements making up the scope. In such cases, the
study boundaries can be limited to the key elements of the scope.
Primary assets are of two types:
1 - Business processes (or sub-processes) and activities, for example:





Processes whose loss or degradation make it impossible to carry out the mission of the organization
Processes that contain secret processes or processes involving proprietary technology
Processes that, if modified, can greatly affect the accomplishment of the organization's mission
Processes that are necessary for the organization to comply with contractual, legal or regulatory
requirements

2 – Information:
More generally, primary information mainly comprises:





Vital information for the exercise of the organization's mission or business
Personal information, as can be defined specifically in the sense of the national laws regarding privacy
Strategic information required for achieving objectives determined by the strategic orientations
High-cost information whose gathering, storage, processing and transmission require a long time and/or
involve a high acquisition cost

Processes and information that are not identified as sensitive after this activity will have no defined
classification in the remainder of the study. This means that even if such processes or information are
compromised, the organization will still accomplish the mission successfully.
However, they will often inherit controls implemented to protect the processes and information identified as
sensitive.

B.1.2 List and description of supporting assets
The scope consists of assets that should be identified and described. These assets have vulnerabilities that
are exploitable by threats aiming to impair the primary assets of the scope (processes and information). They
are of various types:
Hardware
The hardware type consists of all the physical elements supporting processes.

conveying or transmitting data.
Examples: printer, removable disc drive.
Data medium (passive)
These are media for storing data or functions.
Electronic medium
An information medium that can be connected to a computer or computer network for data storage.
Despite their compact size, these media may contain a large amount of data. They can be used with
standard computing equipment.
Examples: floppy disc, CD ROM, back-up cartridge, removable hard disc, memory key, tape.
Other media
Static, non-electronic media containing data.
Examples: paper, slide, transparency, documentation, fax.

Operating system
This includes all the programmes of a computer making up the operational base from which all the
other programmes (services or applications) are run. It includes a kernel and basic functions or
services. Depending on the architecture, an operating system may be monolithic or made up of a
micro-kernel and a set of system services. The main elements of the operating system are all the
equipment management services (CPU, memory, disc, and network interfaces), task or process
management services and user rights management services.
Service, maintenance or administration software
Software characterised by the fact that it complements the operating system services and is not directly
at the service of the users or applications (even though it is usually essential or even indispensable for
the global operation of the information system).
Package software or standard software
Standard software or package software are complete products commercialised as such (rather than
one-off or specific developments) with medium, release and maintenance. They provide services for
users and applications, but are not personalised or specific in the way that business applications are.
Examples: data base management software, electronic messaging software, groupware, directory
software, web server software, etc.
Business application
Standard business application
This is commercial software designed to give users direct access to the services and functions
they require from their information system in their professional context. There is a very wide,
theoretically limitless, range of fields.
Examples: accounts software, machine tool control software, customer care software, personnel
competency management software, administrative software, etc.
Specific business application
This is software in which various aspects (primarily support, maintenance, upgrading, etc.) have
been specifically developed to give users direct access to the services and functions they require
from their information system. There is a very wide, theoretically unlimited, range of fields.
Examples: Invoice management of telecom operators' customers, real time monitoring application
for rocket launching.
Network
The network type consists of all telecommunications devices used to interconnect several physically remote
computers or elements of an information system.
Medium and supports
Communications and telecommunications media or equipment are characterised mainly by the
physical and technical characteristics of the equipment (point-to-point, broadcast) and by the
communication protocols (link or network - levels 2 and 3 of the OSI 7-layer model).
Examples: Public Switching Telephone Network (PSTN), Ethernet, GigabitEthernet, Asymmetric
Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), wireless protocol specifications (e.g. WiFi 802.11), Bluetooth,
FireWire.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Passive or active relay
This sub-type includes all devices that are not the logical terminations of communications (IS
vision) but are intermediate or relay devices. Relays are characterised by the supported network
communication protocols. In addition to the basic relay, they often include routing and/or filtering
functions and services, employing communication switches and routers with filters. They can
often be administrated remotely and are usually capable of generating logs.
Examples: bridge, router, hub, switch, automatic exchange.
Communication interface
The communication interfaces of the processing units are connected to the processing units but
are characterised by the media and supported protocols, by any installed filtering, log or warning
generation functions and their capacities and by the possibility and requirement of remote
administration.
Examples: General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Ethernet adaptor.
Personnel
The personnel type consists of all the groups of people involved in the information system.
Decision maker
Decision makers are the owners of the primary assets (information and functions) and the
managers of the organization or specific project.
Examples: top management, project leader.
Users
Users are the personnel who handle sensitive elements in the context of their activity and who
have a special responsibility in this respect. They may have special access rights to the
information system to carry out their everyday tasks.
Examples: human resources management, financial management, risk manager.
Operation/ Maintenance staff
These are the personnel in charge of operating and maintaining the information system. They
have special access rights to the information system to carry out their everyday tasks.
Examples: system administrator, data administrator, back-up, Help Desk, application deployment
operator, security officers.
Developers
Developers are in charge of developing the organization's applications. They have access to part
of the information system with high-level rights but do not take any action on the production data.
Examples: business application developers.
Site
The site type comprises all the places containing the scope or part of the scope, and the physical means
required for it to operate.

This concerns all locations in which the organization's means of security cannot be applied.
Examples: homes of the personnel, premises of another organization, environment outside
the site (urban area, hazard area).
Premises
This place is bounded by the organization's perimeter directly in contact with the outside.
This may be a physical protective boundary obtained by creating physical barriers or means
of surveillance around buildings.
Examples: establishment, buildings.
Zone
A zone is formed by a physical protective boundary forming partitions within the
organization's premises. It is obtained by creating physical barriers around the
organization's information processing infrastructures.
Examples: offices, reserved access zone, secure zone.

Authorities
These are organizations from which the studied organization derives its authority. They may
be legally affiliated or external. This imposes constraints on the studied organization in
terms of regulations, decisions and actions.
Examples: administrating body, Head office of an organization.
Structure of the organization
This consists of the various branches of the organization, including its cross-functional
activities, under the control of its management.
Examples: human resources management, IT management, purchasing management,
business unit management, building safety service, fire service, audit management.
Project or system organization
This concerns the organization set up for a specific project or service.
Examples: new application development project, information system migration project.
Subcontractors / Suppliers / Manufacturers
These are organizations that provide the organization with a service or resources and
bound to it by contract.
Examples: facilities management company, outsourcing company, consultancy companies.

B.2 Asset valuation
The next step after asset identification is to agree upon the scale to be used and the criteria for assigning a
particular location on that scale to each asset, based on valuation. Because of the diversity of assets found
within most organizations it is likely that some assets that have a known monetary value will be valued in the
local unit of currency while others which have a more qualitative value may be assigned a value ranging, for
example, from ”very low” to ”very high”. The decision to use a quantitative scale versus a qualitative scale is
really a matter of organizational preference, but should be relevant to the assets being valued. Both valuation
types could be used for the same asset.
Typical terms used for the qualitative valuation of assets include words such as: negligible, very low, low,
medium, high, very high, and critical. The choice and range of terms suitable to an organization is strongly
dependent on an organization's needs for security, organizational size, and other organization specific factors.
Criteria
The criteria used as the basis for assigning a value to each asset should be written out in unambiguous terms.
This is often one of the most difficult aspects of asset valuation since the values of some assets may have to
be subjectively determined and since many different individuals are likely to be making the determination.
Possible criteria used to determine an asset’s value include its original cost, its replacement or re-creation
cost or its value may be abstract, e.g. the value of an organization’s reputation.
Another basis for the valuation of assets is the costs incurred due to the loss of confidentiality, integrity and
availability as the result of an incident. Non-repudiation, accountability, authenticity and reliability should also
be considered, as appropriate. Such a valuation would provide the important element dimensions to asset
value, in addition to replacement cost, based on estimates of the adverse business consequences that would
result from security incidents with an assumed set of circumstances. It is emphasized that this approach
accounts for consequences that are necessary to factor into the risk assessment.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Many assets may during the course of valuation have several values assigned. For example: a business plan
may be valued based on the labour expended to develop the plan, it might be valued on the labour to input the
data, and it could be valued based on its value to a competitor. Each of the assigned values will most likely
differ considerably. The assigned value may be the maximum of all possible values or may be the sum of
some or all of the possible values. In the final analysis, which value or values are assigned to an asset should
be carefully determined since the final value assigned enters into the determination of the resources to be
expended for the protection of the asset.
Reduction to the common base
Ultimately, all asset valuations need to be reduced to a common base. This may be done with the aid of
criteria such as those that follow. Criteria that may be used to assess the possible consequences resulting
from a loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, accountability, authenticity, or reliability of
assets are:


 in terms of equipment,
 in terms of studies, experts' reports
Loss of goods / funds / assets
Loss of customers, loss of suppliers
Judicial proceedings and penalties

Industrial crisis (strikes)

Material damage

These criteria are examples of issues to be considered for asset valuation. For carrying out valuations, an
organization needs to select criteria relevant to its type of business and security requirements. This might
mean that some of the criteria listed above are not applicable, and that others might need to be added to the
list.
Scale
After establishing the criteria to be considered, the organization should agree on a scale to be used
organization-wide. The first step is to decide on the number of levels to be used. There are no rules with
regard to the number of levels that are most appropriate. More levels provide a greater level of granularity but
sometimes a too fine differentiation makes consistent assignments throughout the organization difficult.
Normally, any number of levels between 3 (e.g. low, medium, and high) and 10 can be used as long as it is
consistent with the approach the organization is using for the whole risk assessment process.
An organization may define its own limits for asset values, like “low”, “medium”, or “high”. These limits should
be assessed according to the criteria selected (e.g. for possible financial loss, they should be given in
monetary values, but for considerations such as endangerment of personal safety, monetary valuation can be
complex and may not be appropriate for all organizations). Finally, it is entirely up to the organization to decide
what is considered as being “low” or a “high” consequence. A consequence that might be disastrous for a
small organization could be low or even negligible for a very large organization.
Dependencies
The more relevant and numerous the business processes supported by an asset, the greater the value of this
asset. Dependencies of assets on business processes and other assets should be identified as well since this
might influence the values of the assets. For example, the confidentiality of data should be kept throughout its
life-cycle, at all stages, including storage and processing, i.e. the security needs of data storage and
processing programmes should be directly related to the value representing the confidentiality of the data
stored and processed. Also, if a business process is relying on the integrity of certain data being produced by
a programme, the input data of this programme should be of appropriate reliability. Moreover, the integrity of
information will be dependent on the hardware and software used for its storage and processing. Also, the
hardware will be dependent on the power supply and possibly air conditioning. Thus information about
dependencies will assist in the identification of threats and particularly vulnerabilities. Additionally, it will help
to assure that the true value of the assets (through the dependency relationships) is given to the assets,
thereby indicating the appropriate level of protection.
The values of assets on which other assets are dependent may be modified in the following way:


If the values of the dependent assets (e.g. data) are lower or equal to the value of the asset considered
(e.g. software), its value remains the same



If the values of the dependent asset (e.g. data) is greater, then the value of the asset considered (e.g.
software) should be increased according to:
-

The degree of dependency
The values of the other assets

An organization may have some assets that are available more than once, like copies of software
programmes or the same type of computer used in most of the offices. It is important to consider this fact
when doing the asset valuation. On one hand, these assets are overlooked easily, therefore care should be
taken to identify all of them; on the other hand, they could be used to reduce availability problems.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Output
The final output of this step is a list of assets and their values relative to disclosure (preservation of
confidentiality), modification (preservation of integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation and accountability), nonavailability and destruction (preservation of availability and reliability), and replacement cost.

B.3 Impact assessment
An information security incident can impact more than one asset or only a part of an asset. Impact is related to
the degree of success of the incident. As a consequence, there is an important difference between the asset
value and the impact resulting from the incident. Impact is considered as having either an immediate
(operational) effect or a future (business) effect that includes financial and market consequences.
Immediate (operational) impact is either direct or indirect.
Direct:
a)

The financial replacement value of lost (part of) asset

b)

The cost of acquisition, configuration and installation of the new asset or back-up

c)

The cost of suspended operations due to the incident until the service provided by the asset(s) is restored

d)

Impact results in a information security breach

Indirect:
a)

Opportunity cost (financial resources needed to replace or repair an asset would have been used
elsewhere)

b)

The cost of interrupted operations

c)

Potential misuse of information obtained through a security breach

d)

Violation of statutory or regulatory obligations

e)

Violation of ethical codes of conduct

As such, the first assessment (with no controls of any kind) will estimate an impact as very close to the
(combination of the) concerned asset value(s). For any next iteration for this (these) asset(s), the impact will
be different (normally much lower) due to the presence and the effectiveness of the implemented controls.

D.2 Methods for assessment of technical vulnerabilities
Proactive methods such as information system testing can be used to identify vulnerabilities depending on the
criticality of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) system and available resources
(e.g. allocated funds, available technology, persons with the expertise to conduct the test). Test methods
include:





Automated vulnerability scanning tool
Security testing and evaluation
Penetration testing
Code review

The automated vulnerability scanning tool is used to scan a group of hosts or a network for known vulnerable
services (e.g. system allows anonymous File Transfer Protocol (FTP), sendmail relaying). It should be noted,
however, that some of the potential vulnerabilities identified by the automated scanning tool may not represent
real vulnerabilities in the context of the system environment. For example, some of these scanning tools rate
potential vulnerabilities without considering the site’s environment and requirements. Some of the
vulnerabilities flagged by the automated scanning software may actually not be vulnerable for a particular site
but may be configured that way because their environment requires it. Thus, this test method may produce
false positives.
Security testing and evaluation (STE) is another technique that can be used in identifying ICT system
vulnerabilities during the risk assessment process. It includes the development and execution of a test plan
(e.g. test script, test procedures, and expected test results). The purpose of system security testing is to test
the effectiveness of the security controls of an ICT system as they have been applied in an operational
environment. The objective is to ensure that the applied controls meet the approved security specification for
the software and hardware and implement the organization’s security policy or meet industry standards.

Penetration testing can be used to complement the review of security controls and ensure that different facets
of the ICT system are secured. Penetration testing, when used in the risk assessment process, can be used to
assess an ICT system’s ability to withstand intentional attempts to circumvent system security. Its objective is
to test the ICT system from the viewpoint of a threat source and to identify potential failures in the ICT system
protection schemes.
Code review is the most thorough (but also most expensive) way of vulnerability assessment.
The results of these types of security testing will help identify a system’s vulnerabilities.
It is important to note that penetration tools and techniques can give false results unless the vulnerability is
successfully exploited. To exploit particular vulnerabilities one needs to know the exact system/ application/
patches setup on tested system. If those data are not known at the time of testing, it might not be possible to
successfully exploit particular vulnerability (for example, gaining remote reverse shell); however, it is still
possible to crash or restart a tested process or system. In such a case, the tested object should be considered
vulnerable as well.

Annex E
(informative)
Information security risk assessment approaches

E.1 High-level information security risk assessment
The high-level assessment allows definition of the priorities and chronology in the actions. For various
reasons, such as budget, it may not be possible to implement all controls simultaneously and only the most
critical risks can be addressed through the risk treatment process. As well, it can be premature to begin
detailed risk management if implementation is only envisaged after one or two years. To reach this objective,
the high-level assessment may begin with a high-level assessment of consequences instead of starting with a
systematic analysis of threats, vulnerabilities, assets and consequences.
Another reason to start with the high-level assessment is to synchronize with other plans related to change
management (or business continuity). For example, it is not sound to completely secure a system or
application if it is planned to outsource it in the near future, although it may still be worth doing the risk
assessment in order to define the outsource contract.
Features of the high-level risk assessment iteration may include the following:







The high-level risk assessment may address a more global view of the organization and its information
systems, considering the technology aspects as independent from the business issues. By doing this, the
context analysis concentrates more on the business and operational environment than technological
elements.
The high-level risk assessment may address a more limited list of threats, and vulnerabilities grouped in
defined domains or, to expedite the process, it may focus on risk or attack scenarios instead of their
elements.
Risks presented in a high-level risk assessment are frequently more general risk domains than specific
identified risks. As the scenarios or the threats are grouped in domains, the risk treatment proposes lists
of controls in this domain. The risk treatment activities try then first to propose and select common
controls that are valid across the whole system.
However, the high-level risk assessment, because it seldom addresses technology details, is more
appropriate to provide organizational and non-technical controls and management aspects of technical
controls, or key and common technical safeguards such as back-ups and anti-virus.

The advantages of a high-level risk assessment are as follows:




The incorporation of an initial simple approach is likely to gain acceptance of the risk assessment
program.
It should be possible to build a strategic picture of an organizational information security program, i.e. it
will act as a good planning aid.
Resources and money can be applied where they are most beneficial, and systems likely to be in the
greatest need of protection will be addressed first.

As the initial risk analyses are at a high level, and potentially less accurate, the only potential disadvantage is
that some business processes or systems may not be identified as requiring a second, detailed risk
assessment. This can be avoided if there is adequate information on all aspects of the organization and its
information and systems, including information gained from the evaluation of information security incidents.
The high-level risk assessment considers the business values of the information assets, and the risks from the
organization's business point of view. At the first decision point (see Figure 2), several factors assist in
determining whether the high-level assessment is adequate to treat risks; these factors may include the
following:

The business objectives to be achieved by using various information assets;
The degree to which the organization's business depends on each information asset, i.e. whether
functions that the organization considers critical to its survival or the effective conduct of business are
dependent on each asset, or on the confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, accountability,
authenticity, and reliability of the information stored and processed on this asset;
The level of investment in each information asset, in terms of developing, maintaining, or replacing the
asset, and
The information assets, for which the organization directly assigns value.

When these factors are assessed, the decision becomes easier. If the objectives of an asset are extremely
important to an organization's conduct of business, or if the assets are at high risk, then a second iteration, the
detailed risk assessment, should be conducted for the particular information asset (or part thereof).
A general rule to apply is: if the lack of information security can result in significant adverse consequences to
an organization, its business processes or its assets, then a second iteration risk assessment, at more
detailed level, is necessary to identify potential risks.

E.2 Detailed information security risk assessment
The detailed information security risk assessment process involves in-depth identification and valuation of
assets, the assessment of threats to those assets, and assessment of vulnerabilities. The results from these
activities are then used to assess the risks and then identify risk treatment.
The detailed step usually requires considerable time, effort and expertise, and may therefore be most suitable
for information systems at high risk.
The final stage of the detailed information security risk assessment is to assess the overall risks, which is the
focus of this annex.
Consequences may be assessed in several ways, including using quantitative, e.g. monetary, and qualitative
measures (which can be based on the use of adjectives such as moderate or severe), or a combination of
both. To assess the likelihood of threat occurrence, the time frame over which the asset will have value or
needs to be protected should be established. The likelihood of a specific threat occurring is affected by the
following:





The attractiveness of the asset, or possible impact applicable when a deliberate human threat is being
considered
The ease of conversion exploiting a vulnerability of the asset into reward, applicable if a deliberate human
threat is being considered
The technical capabilities of the threat agent, applicable to deliberate human threats, and
The susceptibility of the vulnerability to exploitation, applicable to both technical and non-technical
vulnerabilities

Many methods make use of tables, and combine subjective and empirical measures. It is important that the
organization uses a method with which the organization is comfortable, in which the organization has
confidence, and that will produce repeatable results. A few examples of table-based techniques are given
below.
For additional guidance on techniques that can be used for detailed information security risk assessment, see
IEC 31010.
The following examples use numbers to describe qualitative assessments. Users of these methods should be
aware that it might be invalid to perform further mathematical operations using the numbers that are
qualitative results produced by qualitative risk assessment methods.

E.2.1 Example 1 Matrix with predefined values
In risk assessment methods of this type, actual or proposed physical assets are valued in terms of
replacement or reconstruction costs (i.e. quantitative measurements). These costs are then converted onto
the same qualitative scale as that used for information (see below). Actual or proposed software assets are
valued in the same way as physical assets, with purchase or reconstruction costs identified and then
converted to the same qualitative scale as that used for information. Additionally, if any application software is
found to have its own intrinsic requirements for confidentiality or integrity (for example if source code is itself
commercially sensitive), it is valued in the same way as for information.
The values for information are obtained by interviewing selected business management (the “data owners”)
who can speak authoritatively about the data, to determine the value and sensitivity of the data actually in use,
or to be stored, processed or accessed. The interviews facilitate assessment of the value and sensitivity of the
information in terms of the worst case scenarios that could be reasonably expected to happen from adverse
business consequences due to unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized modification, non-availability for varying
time periods, and destruction.
The valuation is accomplished using information valuation guidelines, which cover such issues as:











Personal safety
Personal information and privacy
Legal and regulatory obligations
Law enforcement
Commercial and economic interests
Financial loss/disruption of activities
Public order
Business policy and operations
Loss of goodwill
Contract or agreement with a customer

The guidelines facilitate identification of the values on a numeric scale, such as the 0 to 4 scale shown in the
example matrix below, thus enabling the recognition of quantitative values where possible and logical, and
qualitative values where quantitative values are not possible, e.g. for endangerment of human life.
The next major activity is the completion of pairs of questionnaires for each threat type, for each grouping of
assets that a threat type relates to, to enable the assessment of the levels of threats (likelihood of occurrence)
and levels of vulnerabilities (ease of exploitation by the threats to cause adverse consequences). Each
question answer attracts a score. These scores are accumulated through a knowledge base and compared
with ranges. This identifies threat levels on say a high to low scale and vulnerability levels similarly, as shown
in the example matrix below, differentiating between the types of consequences as relevant. Information to
complete the questionnaires should be gathered from interviews with appropriate technical, personnel and
accommodation people, and physical location inspections, and reviews of documentation.
The asset values, and the threat and vulnerability levels, relevant to each type of consequence, are matched
in a matrix such as that shown below, to identify for each combination the relevant measure of risk on a scale
of 0 to 8. The values are placed in the matrix in a structured manner. An example is given below:

Asset
Value

For each asset, the relevant vulnerabilities and their corresponding threats are considered. If there is a
vulnerability without a corresponding threat, or a threat without corresponding vulnerability, there is presently
no risk (but care should be taken in case this situation changes). Now the appropriate row in the matrix is
identified by the asset value, and the appropriate column is identified by the likelihood of the threat occurring
and the ease of exploitation. For example, if the asset has the value 3, the threat is “high” and the
vulnerability “low”, the measure of risk is 5. Assume an asset has a value of 2, e.g. for modification, the threat
level is “low” and the ease of exploitation is “high”, then the measure of risk is 4. The size of the matrix, in
terms of the number of threat likelihood categories, ease of exploitation categories and the number of asset
valuation categories, can be adjusted to the needs of the organization. Additional columns and rows will
necessitate additional risk measures. The value of this approach is in ranking the risks to be addressed.
A similar Matrix as shown in Table E.1 b) results from the consideration of the likelihood of an incident
scenario, mapped against the estimated business impact. The likelihood of an incident scenario is given by a
threat exploiting a vulnerability with a certain likelihood. The Table maps this likelihood against the business
impact related to the incident scenario. The resulting risk is measured on a scale of 0 to 8 that can be
evaluated against risk acceptance criteria. This risk scale could also be mapped to a simple overall risk rating,
for example as:
•

•

Low risk: 0-2
Medium Risk: 3-5
High Risk:6-8

E.2.2 Example 2

Ranking of Threats by Measures of Risk

A matrix or table such as that shown in Table E.2 can be used to relate the factors of consequences (asset
value) and likelihood of threat occurrence (taking account of vulnerability aspects). The first step is to evaluate
the consequences (asset value) on a predefined scale, e.g. 1 through 5, of each threatened asset (column “b”
in the table). The second step is to evaluate the likelihood of threat occurrence on a predefined scale, e.g. 1
through 5, of each threat (column “c” in the table). The third step is to calculate the measure of risk by
multiplying (b × c). Finally the threats can be ranked in order of their associated measure of risk. Note that in
this example, 1 is taken as the lowest consequence and the lowest likelihood of occurrence.

E.2.3 Example 3
risks

Assessing a value for the likelihood and the possible consequences of

In this example, the emphasis is placed on the consequences of information security incidents (i.e. incident
scenarios) and on determining which systems should be given priority. This is done by assessing two values
for each asset and risk, which in combination will determine the score for each asset. When all the asset
scores for the system are summed, a measure of risk to that system is determined.
First, a value is assigned to each asset. This value relates to the potential adverse consequences that can
arise if the asset is threatened. For each applicable threat to the asset, this asset value is assigned to the
asset.
Next a likelihood value is assessed. This is assessed from a combination of the likelihood of the threat
occurring and the ease of exploitation of the vulnerability, see Table E.3 expressing the likelihood of an
incident scenario.

Next, an asset/threat score is assigned by finding the intersection of asset value and likelihood value in
Table E.4. The asset/threat scores are totalled to produce an asset total score. This figure can be used to
differentiate between the assets forming part of a system.

Likelihood Value

The final step is to total all the asset total scores for the assets of the system, producing a system score. This
can be used to differentiate between systems and to determine which system's protection should be given
priority.
In the following examples all values are randomly chosen.
Suppose System S has three assets A1, A2 and A3. Also suppose there are two threats T1 and T2 applicable
to system S. Let the value of A1 be 3, similarly let the asset value of A2 be 2 and the asset value of A3 be 4.
If for A1 and T1 the threat likelihood is low and the ease of exploitation of the vulnerability is medium, then the
likelihood value is 1 (see Table E.3).
The asset/threat score A1/T1 can be derived from Table E.4 as the intersection of asset value 3 and likelihood
value 1, i.e. 4. Similarly, for A1/T2 let the threat likelihood is medium and the ease of exploitation of
vulnerability is high, giving an A1/T2 score of 6.
Now the total asset score A1T can be calculated, i.e. 10. The total asset score is calculated for each asset
and applicable threat. The total system score is calculated by adding A1T + A2T + A3T to give ST.
Now different systems can be compared to establish priorities and different assets within one system as well.
Above example shows in terms of information systems, however similar approach can be applied to business
processes.

Annex F
(informative)
Constraints for risk modification

While considering constraints for risk modification the following constraints should be taken into account:
Time constraints:
Many types of time constraints can exist. For example, controls should be implemented within a time period
acceptable for the organization’s managers. Another type of time constraint is whether a control can be
implemented within the lifetime of the information or system. A third type of time constraint may be the period
of time the organization’s managers decides is an acceptable period to be exposed to a particular risk.
Financial constraints:
Controls should not be more expensive to implement or to maintain than the value of risks they are designed
to protect, except where compliance is mandatory (e.g. with legislation). Every effort should be made not to
exceed assigned budgets and achieve financial advantage through the use of controls. However, in some
cases it may not be possible to achieve the desired security and level of risk acceptance due to budget
constraints. This therefore becomes an organization’s managers’ decision for resolution of this situation.
Great care should be taken if the budget reduces the number or quality of controls to be implemented since
this can lead to the implicit retention of greater risk than planned. The established budget for controls should
only be used as a limiting factor with considerable care.
Technical constraints:
Technical problems, like the compatibility of programmes or hardware, can easily be avoided if they are taken
into account during the selection of controls. In addition, the retrospective implementation of controls to an
existing process or system is often hindered by technical constraints. These difficulties may move the balance
of controls towards the procedural and physical aspects of security. It may be necessary to revise the
information security programme in order to achieve security objectives. This can occur when controls do not
meet the expected results in reducing risks without lessening productivity.
Operational constraints
Operational constraints such as the need to operate 24x7 yet still perform back-ups can result in complex and
costly implementation of controls unless they are built into the design right from the start.
Cultural constraints:
Cultural constraints to the selection of controls may be specific to a country, a sector, an organization or even
a department within an organization. Not all controls can be applied in all countries. For example, it may be
possible to implement bag searches in parts of Europe but not in parts of the Middle East. Cultural aspects
cannot be ignored because many controls rely on the active support of the staff. If the staff does not
understand the need for the control or do not find it culturally acceptable, the control will become ineffective
over time.
Ethical constraints:
Ethical constraints can have major implications on controls as ethics change based on social norms. This can
prevent implementing controls such as email scanning in some countries. Privacy of information can also
change dependent on the ethics of the region or government. These may be of more concern in some industry
sectors than others, for example, government and healthcare.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Environmental constraints:
Environmental factors may influence the selection of controls, such as space availability, extreme climate
conditions, surrounding natural and urban geography. For example earthquake proofing may be required in
some countries but unnecessary in others.
Legal constraints:
Legal factors such as personal data protection or criminal code provisions for information processing could
affect the selection of controls. Legislative and regulatory compliance can mandate certain types of control
including data protection and financial audit; they can also prevent the use of some controls, e.g. encryption.
Other laws and regulations such as labour relations legislation, fire department, health and safety, and
economic sector regulations, etc., could affect control selection as well.
Ease of use:
A poor human-technology interface will result in human error and may render the control useless. Controls
should be selected to provide optimal ease of use while achieving an acceptable level of residual risk to the
business. Controls that are difficult to use will impact their effectiveness, as users may try to circumvent or
ignore them as much as possible. Complex access controls within an organization could encourage users to
find alternate, unauthorized methods of access.
Personnel constraints:
The availability and salary cost of specialized skill sets to implement controls, and the ability to move staff
between locations in adverse operating conditions, should be considered. Expertise may not be readily
available to implement planned controls or the expertise may be overly costly for the organization. Other
aspects such as the tendency of some staff to discriminate other staff members who are not security screened
can have major implications for security policies and practices. As well, the need to hire the right people for
the work, and finding the right people, may result in hiring before security screening is completed. The
requirement for security screening to be completed before hiring is the normal, and safest, practice.
Constraints of integrating new and existing controls:
Integration of new controls in the existing infrastructure and the interdependencies between controls are often
overlooked. New controls may not easily be implemented if there is incongruity or incompatibility with existing
controls. For example, a plan to use biometric tokens for physical access control may cause conflict with an
existing PIN-pad based system for access control. The cost of changing controls from existing controls to the
planned controls should include elements to be added to the overall costs of risk treatment. It may not be
possible to implement a selected control due to interference with current controls.

NOTE 2 Residual risk can also be known as “retained risk”.

NOTE 1 Residual risk can contain unidentified risk.

NOTE 2
The English term “likelihood” does not have a direct equivalent in
some languages; instead, the equivalent of the term “probability” is often used.
However, in English, “probability” is often narrowly interpreted as a
mathematical term. Therefore, in risk management terminology, “likelihood” is
used with the intent that it should have the same broad interpretation as the
term “probability” has in many languages other than English.

NOTE 1
In risk management terminology, the word “likelihood” is used to
refer to the chance of something happening, whether defined, measured or
determined objectively or subjectively, qualitatively or quantitatively, and
described using general terms or mathematically (such as a probability or a
frequency over a given time period).

assets and thereby cause harm to an organization.

NOTE 5
Uncertainty is the state, even partial, of deficiency of information
related to, understanding or knowledge of, an event, its consequence, or
likelihood.

Information security risk is often expressed in terms of a
combination of the consequences of an information security event and the
associated likelihood (3.9) of occurrence.

NOTE 3
Risk is often characterized by reference to potential events (3.3)
and consequences (3.1), or a combination of these.
