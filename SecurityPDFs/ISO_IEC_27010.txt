Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27010 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.

Introduction
This International Standard is a supplement to ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and ISO/IEC 27002:2005 for use by
information sharing communities. The guidelines contained within this International Standard are in addition to
and complement the generic guidance given within other members of the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards.
Whereas ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and ISO/IEC 27002:2005 address information exchange between
organizations, they do so in a generic manner. When organizations wish to communicate sensitive information
to multiple other organizations, the originator must have confidence that its use in those other organizations
will be subject to adequate security controls implemented by the receiving organizations. This can be
achieved through the establishment of an information sharing community, where each member trusts the
other members to protect the shared information, even though the organizations may otherwise be in
competition with each other.
An information sharing community cannot work without trust. Those providing information must be able to trust
the recipients not to disclose or to act upon the data inappropriately. Those receiving information must be able
to trust that information is accurate, subject to any qualifications notified by the originator. Both aspects are
important, and must be supported by demonstrably effective security policies and the use of good practice. To
achieve this, the community members must all implement a common management system covering the
security of the shared information. This is the ISMS for the information sharing community.
In addition, information sharing can take place between information sharing communities, where not all
recipients will be known to the originator. This will only work if there is adequate trust between the
communities and their information sharing agreements. It is particularly relevant to the sharing of sensitive
information between diverse communities such as different industry or market sectors.
This International Standard provides guidelines and general principles on how the specified requirements can
be met using established messaging and other technical methods. It is designed to support the creation of
trust when exchanging and sharing sensitive information, thereby encouraging the international growth of
information sharing communities.

4.1

Concepts and justification
Introduction

ISMS guidance specific to inter-sector and inter-organizational communications has been identified in
Clauses 5 to 15 below.
ISO/IEC 27002:2005 defines controls that cover the exchange of information between organizations on a
bilateral basis, and also controls for the general distribution of publicly available information. However, in
some circumstances there exists a need to share information within a community of organizations, where the
information is sensitive in some way and cannot be made publicly available other than to members of the
community. Often the information can only be made available to certain individuals within each member
organization, or may have other security requirements such as anonymisation of information. This
International Standard defines additional potential controls and provides additional guidance and interpretation
of ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and ISO/IEC 27002:2005 in order to meet these requirements.

4.2

Information sharing communities

To be effective, information sharing communities must have some common interest or other relationship to
define the scope of the shared sensitive information. For example, communities may be market sector specific,
and limit membership to organizations within that one sector. Of course, there may be other bases for
common interest, for example, geographical location, or common ownership.

4.3

Community management

Information sharing communities will be created from independent organizations or parts of organizations.
There may therefore not be clear or uniform organizational structures and management functions applying to
all members. For information security management to be effective, management commitment is necessary.
Therefore, the organizational structures and management functions applying to community information
security management should be clearly defined.
Differences among member organizations of an information sharing community should also be considered.
The differences could include:
 whether member organizations already operate their own ISMS, and
 member rules on protections of assets and information disclosure.

4.4

Supporting entities

Many information sharing communities will choose to establish or appoint a centralised supporting entity to
organize and support information sharing. Such an entity can provide many supporting controls such as
anonymisation of source and recipients more easily and efficiently than where members communicate directly.
There are a number of different organizational models that can be used to create supporting entities. Annex D
to this International Standard describe two common models, the Trusted Information Communication Entity
(TICE) and the Warning, Advice and Reporting Point (WARP).

4.5

Inter-sector communication

Many information sharing communities will be sector based, as this provides a natural scope of common
interest. However, there may well be information shared by such communities that would be of interest to
other information sharing communities established in other sectors. In such cases it may be possible to
establish information sharing communities of information sharing communities, again based on some common
interest, such as the nature of the shared information. We refer to this as inter-sector communication.

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

Inter-sector communication is greatly facilitated where supporting entities exist within each information sharing
community, as the necessary information exchange agreements and controls can then be established
between the supporting entities, rather than between all members of all communities. Some inter-sector
communities will require anonymisation of the source or recipient organizations; this also can be achieved by
use of supporting entities.

4.6

Conformity

Any information security management system (ISMS) created and operated in accordance with
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and using controls from ISO/IEC 27002:2005, this International Standard and other
sources can be assessed for conformity against ISO/IEC 27001:2005, without modification or addition to that
International Standard.
However, there are a number of places where ISO/IEC 27001:2005 will need to be interpreted when applied
to an information sharing community (or, for inter-sector communication, a community of communities).
The first area where interpretation is required is the definition of the organization concerned.
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 requires that an ISMS is established by an organization and operates within the context
of its overall business activities and the risks that it faces (ISO/IEC 27001:2005, 4.1). In this context, the
relevant organization is the information sharing community. However, the members of the information sharing
community will themselves be organizations – see Figure 1.

Ak Member organization k of the community (k = 1 ... n), including any supporting entity.

Figure 1 — Communities and organizations
Secondly, in many information sharing communities, not all persons within the member organizations will be
permitted access to the sensitive information shared between members. In this case, part of the member
organization will be within scope of the community ISMS and part will be outside. The part outside the
community scope will only have access to community information if it is marked for wider release – see
Figure 2.

Figure 2 — Member partially in scope
It is possible that members of the information sharing community may have their own information security
management systems, and in consequence some processes might fall within scope of both the community
and members’ management systems. In this case, there is at least a theoretical possibility that there might be
conflicting and incompatible requirements upon those processes. This would be a case where exclusion from
the scope of the member’s ISMS might be justified – see ISO/IEC 27001:2005, 4.2.1 a).
When defining its risk assessment approach (ISO/IEC 27001:2005, 4.2.1 c), the information sharing
community will need to recognise that the impact of risks may be different on different members of the
community. The community will therefore need to choose a risk assessment methodology that can handle
non-uniform impact, similarly for its risk assessment criteria.
Measuring the effectiveness of the selected controls (ISO/IEC 27001:2005, 4.2.3 c) will need the participation
of all members of the information sharing community. All members will need to provide regular feedback to
information providers and the community as a whole concerning the effectiveness of the controls in their own
environment.

4.7

Communications model

Communications of sensitive information as covered by this International Standard can take any form – written,
verbal or electronic – provided that the selected control requirements are met.
In the remainder of this International Standard, individual sensitive communications are described in terms of
the following participants:
 The source of an item of information is the person or organization that originates an item of information;
the source does not need to be a member of the community.
 The originator is the member of an information sharing community that initiates its distribution within the
community. The originator may distribute the information directly, or send it to a supporting entity for
distribution. The originator may but need not be the same as the source of the information; the originator
may conceal the identity of the source. Communities may provide facilities to enable a member to conceal
its own identity as the originator.
 A recipient is a receiver of information distributed within the community. Recipients need not be members
of the community if the information is identified as available for wider distribution. Communities may
provide facilities to enable recipients to conceal their identities from the originators of information.

security management policies and direction for the information sharing community. It should be made
available to all employees involved in information sharing within the community. The policy may restrict its
dissemination to other employees of community members.
The information security policy document should define the information marking and distribution policy used
within the community.
5.1.2

Review of the information security policy

Control 5.1.2 from ISO/IEC 27002:2005 is augmented as follows:
Implementation guidance
The input to the management review should include information on significant changes to membership of the
information sharing community.

Inventory of assets

No additional information specific to inter-sector or inter-organizational communications.
7.1.2

Ownership of assets

No additional information specific to inter-sector or inter-organizational communications.
7.1.3

Acceptable use of assets

Control 7.1.3 from ISO/IEC 27002:2005 is augmented as follows:
Implementation guidance
Information provided by other members of an information sharing community is an asset, and should be
protected and disseminated in accordance with any rules set by the information sharing community or by the
originator.

7.2

Information classification

7.2.1

Classification guidelines

Control 7.2.1 from ISO/IEC 27002:2005 is augmented as follows:
Control
Information should be classified in terms of its value, legal requirements, sensitivity, credibility and criticality to
the organization.
Implementation guidance
As well as the criteria given in ISO/IEC 27002:2005, information should be classified in terms of its credibility.
This should be assessed in terms of the reputation of its source, technical content, and quality of description.
Likewise, sensitivity can depend on many aspects of information beyond a need for maintaining its
confidentiality, such as the impact of disclosure, urgency for distribution or potential to compromise the
anonymity of its source.
Care should be taken in interpreting classification markings assigned by other members of an information
sharing community.
EXAMPLE
One well-known Email client displays the message “Please treat this as Confidential” when displaying
emails where the sensitivity header field has been set to “company confidential” (RFC 4021 [2]). It is not clear in this case
if the originator intended “company confidential” (and the message has been sent in error) or intended “confidential to you,
the recipient”.

7.2.2

Information labelling and handling

No additional information specific to inter-sector or inter-organizational communications.

7.3

Information exchanges protection

A control objective additional to ISO/IEC 27002:2005, clause 7, asset management, is:
Objective: To ensure adequate protection of information exchanges within an information sharing
community.
Information exchanged between members of an information sharing community should be protected in a
consistent manner, even though the members are independent entities or parts of entities that may mark,
distribute and protect their own information in different ways.
Where anonymity is requested, any information identifying the source of the information exchange should
be removed. Likewise, it should be possible to receive shared information without revealing the recipient’s
identity.
Release of shared information outside the community should be controlled.
7.3.1

Information dissemination

Control
Information dissemination within the receiving member should be limited, based on pre-defined dissemination
markings defined by the community.
Implementation guidance
Information which has no assigned dissemination marking should be given a default dissemination defined by
the information sharing community. If in doubt, or where there is no generally accepted agreement on default
dissemination, information should be treated conservatively. If possible, the recipient should request the
originator to re-transmit with an explicit dissemination marking.
Dissemination restrictions may include limitations on use such as controlling electronic copy and paste,
preventing screen shots being taken, or preventing printing and export.
Other information
Different attributes or components of shared information may have different sensitivities. In particular,
knowledge of the existence of a message or other shared information may have a different sensitivity to its
contents.
Information rights management functionality is often used to enforce in-use limitations. If so, a clear user rights
policy or model is needed so that users understand what their system will allow them to do and where they will
be blocked.
7.3.2

Information disclaimers

Control
Each information exchange should begin with a disclaimer, listing any special requirements to follow by the
recipients in addition to the normal information markings.
Implementation guidance
A recipient should request clarification from the originator if the disclaimer is not fully understood, or cannot be
implemented.

7.3.3

Information credibility

Control
Each information exchange should indicate the originator’s degree of confidence in the transmitted
information’s credibility and accuracy.
Implementation guidance
Based on urgency, potential consequences and technical constraints, it may not be possible to validate all
information before transmission. Where limitations exist, these should be indicated as part of the message.
Indicating reservations on credibility of information is particularly important where the source is anonymous or
unknown. It is also important to indicate where the originator has been able to validate the information given
directly, and can vouch for its authenticity.
7.3.4

Information sensitivity reduction

Control
The originator of an information exchange should indicate if the sensitivity of the information supplied will
reduce after some external event, or the passage of time.
Implementation guidance
Even if the sensitivity of supplied information reduces with time, it may still need protection. Classification
guidelines (see 6.4.2) may need to include defaults for sensitivity reduction.
7.3.5

Anonymous source protection

Control
A community member should remove any source identification information in any communication it originates
or receives where anonymity is requested.
Implementation guidance
The originator of information is responsible for obtaining approval from the source (if different) before
communicating the information to other members of the information sharing community. The originator should
also ask the source if it can be identified as the original provider of the information.
It is important that the source protection process looks at message content as well as message origin,
because analysis of the content may reveal the identity of the source. Where possible, the originator of the
message should ask the source to review the anonymised information and the list of intended recipients
before it is distributed.
EXAMPLE
A message such as “our ATMs were disabled today by a new virus that was not detected by our firewall
but was detected by our policy server” could reveal the source if only one bank suffered public service disruption on the
day in question.

There are technical mechanisms that can be used to provide authenticity without compromising anonymity.
For example, shared cryptographic secrets could be used to confirm that a communication originated from a
member of the community without revealing the actual identity of the originator.

7.3.6

Anonymous recipient protection

Control
With the approval of the originator, members of a community should be able to receive communications
without revealing their own identities.
Implementation guidance
Anonymous receipt can be implemented by both technical means (e.g. cryptography) and procedural means
(e.g. routing through a supporting entity). Care must be taken to ensure anonymity does not breach legal
constraints or reduce the overall level of trust within the community.
Other information
Anonymous receipt is often necessary for effective inter-sector communications because sector communities
will wish to keep their membership details private.
7.3.7

Onwards release authority

Control
Unless it is marked for wider release, information should not be distributed beyond the information sharing
community without formal approval from the originator.
Implementation guidance
Each recipient should be responsible for obtaining any necessary authorisations for wider release from the
originator prior to onwards distribution.
In inter-sector communications, the originator cannot know who all the organizations that receive the
information will be. In such a case, a general or specific sector release approval will need to be granted.
Other information
The Traffic Light Protocol (see Annex C) is often used to indicate how information can be further distributed
without seeking additional approval.

13 Information security incident management
13.1 Reporting information security events and weaknesses
13.1.1 Reporting information security events
Control 13.1.1 from ISO/IEC 27002:2005 is augmented as follows:
Implementation guidance
Members of an information sharing community should consider whether detected events should be reported to
other members of the community. The community should agree and publish guidance on the types of incident
that will be of interest to other members. Members should exercise judgement to ensure only events
potentially of interest to other members are reported.
There is a strong tendency for incidents to be kept confidential and for a community member not to disclose
incident information in order to protect the originator’s reputation. However, communicating incident
information to others will foster future cooperation and coordination in incident prevention, prompt rapid
reaction to incidents and will improve overall security within the community. Events and incidents can be
reported without necessarily revealing all their consequences.
Likewise, members should examine all reported events promptly to see if they will have an impact upon their
own operations. For example, a routine announcement by a member providing a shared service of a planned
maintenance operation might require other members to review the reliability of alternative providers before the
maintenance activity starts.
13.1.2 Reporting security weaknesses

Control
An early warning system should be deployed within the information sharing community to effectively
communicate priority information as soon as it is available.
Implementation guidance
Priority information is information that may enable other community members to avoid or minimise similar
undesirable events. It is important that such information is shared urgently, even if it is not fully analysed or
confirmed.

Investigations based on information distributed by an information sharing community should be performed, to
reduce the risks of similar incidents and develop a better understanding of the risks facing the community and
any related significant information infrastructures. Such investigations could be performed by the community
members involved, or by a supporting entity, if one exists.
Following reported incidents, post incident reviews should be performed by members of the information
sharing community to trigger updates to security incident response plans, related procedures and the
business risk profile, even if the member was not affected by the incident in question. Each member should
ensure that reported incident responses are assessed, and any lessons or possible improvements to the

Annex A
(informative)
Sharing sensitive information

A.1 Introduction
Sensitive information is an asset of important value that must be securely managed when shared between
organizations. It must be delivered in time to address business issues and to make better decisions, even
more so if it is critical to the organization.
Information sharing communities may represent many types of organization and even individual people.
Communities may be extraordinarily diverse in their membership, or be aligned very closely with a form of
business activity such as a particular industry or market sector. Communities may be located in both the
public and private sectors, or may contain members of both kinds. The requirement is a common wish to
share sensitive information of some type, and to accept agreed controls and processes governing the use of
that information.
To securely exchange sensitive information within an information-sharing community, it is necessary to design,
implement and monitor processes to provide a secured flow of information on a timely basis. The processes
should ensure that information is disseminated to the appropriate persons, whilst providing reasonable
assurance that the information cannot be used for malicious purposes and is not indiscriminately re-distributed
so as to become essentially public information.
The effectiveness of distribution will be determined by the degree of trust that members hold in the
relationships established by the information sharing community. At the same time, the security mechanisms
relating to communications should prevent distributing information to persons or organizations that would
likely:
 use or accumulate the data to perform malicious acts;
 publicly disseminate information without permission of the information originator;
 provide information that has not been sufficiently analysed and therefore induces inappropriate actions,
which could waste or mislead resources and the impact on organizations.
For information sharing communities to function effectively, recipients of information must be empowered by
their member organizations to act upon the information received, and must not be encouraged to misuse that
information, for example for commercial advantage.

A.2 Challenges
Adequate information security management for inter-sector and inter-organizational communications is
strongly recommended to face the following challenges; failure to do so could impact normal business
conditions and cause disruptions during incidents:
 New security threats and vulnerabilities.
 System and network increased dependencies.
 Contractual, legal, regulatory and business evolution and limits.
 Adequate communications models establishment.

17

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

 Attack and reaction processes coordination.
 Ongoing governance.
Secured and resilient communications between community members should include the following elements:
 Risk knowledge and management.
 Dissemination and communication.
 Monitoring.
While these three elements should be taken for their specific value, they are closely linked and complement
each other.
It is difficult to develop trust between members of an information sharing community without personal
relationships with the representatives of other members. People need to meet face to face, in order to build
relationships and create confidence in each other’s credibility and discretion. It is difficult to create trust using
only remote communications technologies. It is also difficult to establish mechanisms which give confidence in
the credibility of the source of information whilst retaining the anonymity of that source. People will often speak
more freely if they have confidence that their identity will be kept confidential.
An information sharing community can be effective even if not all members share all information with all other
members. Distribution mechanisms must be flexible enough to enable distribution to be limited to specific
members of the community, or to be limited by topic.
Finally, when sharing information between communities (for example, in inter-sector communications), the
gatekeepers between the communities face special difficulties. Sources of information will not necessarily
have knowledge of the membership of other communities and must rely on the interfaces to protect anonymity
and other conditions of release. The gatekeepers may lack the specialist knowledge to realise when certain
community communications should not be passed further. These problems are typically even worse in
international rather than inter-sector communications.

A.3 Potential benefits
Sharing sensitive information with others inevitably increases the potential risk of inappropriate disclosure. For
a community to be effective, these risks must be managed and minimised, and the benefits seen as
outweighing the accepted residual risks.
The potential benefits of sharing sensitive information include:
 Early warning of any significant change in the risk situation, like new threats, updated likelihood of attack,
newly discovered vulnerabilities, etc.
 Improved security through shared best practice.
 Access to useful information not available from any public source.
 Cost savings through elimination of duplicated effort.
 Better risk assessments through greater understanding of threats and vulnerabilities.
 Better organization of maintenance and intervention from information concerning similar activities at other
organizations.
 Better preparedness for security incidents.

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

 Benchmarking of security measures against similar organizations.
 Corporate social responsibility.
 Compliance with legal requirements or corporate policy.
It is essential that the community monitoring and review processes identify concrete benefits (and drawbacks)
from community membership for use by members in assessing their continued membership of the community.

A.4 Applicability
Information can be exchanged between many types of organization, large or small, government or private,
similar or diverse. However, the greatest benefits may often be experienced by organizations operating within
the same sector or with the same corporate objectives, which share sector-specific categories of information
security risk. ISO/IEC 27006 [3] identifies some such sectors.
There may also be great benefits in sharing information across sectors, either by defining communities based
upon other characteristics (such as geographical location) or by sharing information with other sector-based
information sharing communities in a hierarchical structure of communities.

A.5 Defining and operating an information sharing community
The information sharing community should define the rules and conditions governing its operation. Such rules
and conditions should include:
 The rules and conditions governing membership of the information sharing community and its internal
organization;
 The objectives of the information sharing community and intended benefits to members;
 The procedures for members joining or leaving the information sharing community;
 The rules and conditions governing any centralised community processes or entities such as a TICE or
WARP;
 The rules and conditions regarding obligations of community members, disciplinary and expulsion
processes and criteria;
 Clear rules for how members may use and pass on shared information;
 The other legal and financial obligations and conditions of community membership.
The rules and conditions of the information sharing community should also:
 ensure that information is communicated in an efficient and secure manner that ensures that its target
audience properly receives the data in good time;
 specify and prioritise potential and selected communication channels, in terms of priority usage to
communicate the data for each identified information type;
 specify the permitted circumstances under which information is transmitted to members of the community;
 specify the mandatory and optional data protection and distribution attributes associated with community
communications;

19

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

 specify clear rules for interpreting the data protection and distribution attributes concerning information
dissemination;
 require members to provide feedback on the relevance, timeliness and accuracy of the information
received;
 where possible, specify or adapt existing messaging standards for the exchange of information.
The communication rules shall define the frequency of communication, any requirements for confirmation of
receipt, and any priority or escalation criteria. The rules should recognise that members of the information
sharing community may have varying levels of trust in other members of the community. That degree of trust
may vary over time and situation.
Appropriate communication channels should be selected by assessing their strengths and weaknesses when
delivering the identified information types supported by the community, based on criteria such as target
audience, attributes of the information to be delivered, channel reach and frequency, and cost. Examples of
possible communication channels are electronic messaging, public or member-only sites, conference or twoway phone calls, letters sent by public postal services or face-to-face meetings. The influence a
communication has on its target audience depends on the effectiveness of the channel in reaching the
audience, its credibility with the audience and its appropriateness to the issue or the information subject.
Not all information needs to be communicated in real-time; some information can best be shared through
routine contact.
Possible examples of when information will be transmitted to members of the community are immediate
reporting of detected incidents fitting predefined profiles, routine reporting on a time basis, or responses to
requests for information from other members. Possible examples of data protection and distribution attributes
are a requirement to conceal the origin of the information, the sensitivity of the information or the originator’s
assessment of the trustworthiness of the information. An example of a set of rules for interpreting data
protection and distribution attributes is the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) – see Annex C. Attributes may vary
depending on the communications channel used. For example, the mandatory attributes for postal distribution
may well be different from those for Internet email.
Whatever technical solutions are selected and implemented, they should be appropriate for the types of
information shared within the community and consistent with the defined objectives of the community. Face to
face contact builds trust and may be a necessary way to grow communities by inviting new members.
However, the existence of a trusted platform or other sharing infrastructure may itself encourage membership.

A.6 Information exchange agreements
The information sharing community should define in an information exchange agreement the mechanisms and
processes governing community communications. Information can be exchanged by letter, or orally at face-toface meetings, as well as electronically. Information can be exchanged formally, using predefined formats and
protocols, or informally, in an unstructured way. Information could be exchanged on a routine or ad-hoc basis.
Information can be exchanged by peer-to-peer communications, hierarchically or through a centralised
supporting entity such as a TICE or WARP.
The information exchange agreement may permit information to be shared with only selected members of the
information sharing community, or only to be made shared anonymously. Likewise, even where centralised
reporting facilities exist, it may permit information to be passed between members directly.
The information exchange agreement should specify the types of information that may be exchanged between
members of the community, in order to ensure a common understanding by the community members of the
communicated information and to ensure that members design and implement appropriate security measures
for the sensitivity level of the shared information.

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

Examples of possible information types are:
 “Announcements”, which correspond to informative explained events;
 “Alerts and warnings”, which correspond to unexplained physical or IT-related events, denial of service
attacks, scanning or spoofing;
 “Incident handling”, which correspond to analysis, response support and response coordination relating to
actual incidents;
 “Information requests”, which correspond to requests for information from one member of the community
addressed to all or some other community members.
 “Quality of service predictions”, which provide information on the predicted effectiveness and reliability of
the various community communications channels.
Too much information sharing can be as bad as too little, unless a suitable method of filtering the data is
included. If building trend information is seen as a main benefit of sharing, there must be a method for
differentiating high priority “act now” information from low priority “for the record” information.

A.7 Success factors
Effective communities will have genuine shared interests, although not all members may be interested in all
aspects. For example, fixed line telecom companies will not be interested in wireless problems, but will
interested as interested as mobile companies in identifying hoax calls.
Members of effective communities will use empowered representatives that can make things happen internally.
Effective communities may limit or otherwise constrain membership, for example to ensure fair representation
in decision making.

A.8 Scope of the ISMS for an information sharing community
The scope of the ISMS for an information sharing community should include:
 all processes used for the communication of information between community members, including
intermediaries;
 the storage of information as relevant during the communication;
 the processes implemented by the relevant members to send and receive shared information;
 the processes implemented by community members for the destruction of shared information.
The scope should not include information security management processes implemented by the relevant
community members to manage their own information security, and possibly covered by other information
security management systems, apart from restrictions placed on the nature of the information to be shared
and the interfaces to the information sharing system. The ISMS could be managed centrally by a supporting
entity such as a TICE or WARP, or it could be managed collaboratively by the members of the community.

Annex B
(informative)
Establishing trust in information exchanges

B.1 Statement trust
A recipient’s degree of trust in a received statement is largely predicated on the degree to which the source of
the message is trusted, and the source’s own trust in the statement.
This is perhaps best encapsulated in the “5 By 5” model used within the law enforcement and intelligence
communities:
 {A – E} Decreasing degree of trust in source;
 {1 – 5} Decreasing degree of trust placed by source in information.
Thus “A-1” information is expected to be implicitly trusted, whereas “E-5” information will typically be discarded.
But, of course, in the real world there is very little “A-1” information. Perhaps the best known examples where
both the source and information are expected to be implicitly trusted, but for which occasional errors have to
be expected, is the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) based satellite navigation systems, where
instances of mapping or route planning system errors have been accidentally misleading, causing large
vehicles to be misdirected down small tracks, which are often the stuff of “light relief” items in the press.
A further issue with regard to trust in statements is the risk of specious reinforcement. There is an intrinsic
tendency – or underlying assumption – that multiple instances of the same information from seemingly
differing sources is confirmatory.
This, to some extent, is of course true, but such trust cannot be taken too literally, and, in particular, any
mathematical model of such trust should not assign linear weighting to additional instances.

B.2 Technological support
B.2.1 Introduction
There are a number of technologies that have recently been developed to support trust in electronically
supplied information generated by unknown or unfamiliar entities. Such technologies are closely associated
with the concept of “Web 2.0” [4]. Web 2.0 is not a set of technologies – rather it is a philosophy/concept that
relates to social media and incorporates ideas such as the use of the Web as a platform, harnessing collective.
Two facets of Web 2.0 are of particular relevance to this International Standard:
 Pseudo anonymity;
 Reputation systems, also called reputation engines.

B.2.2 Anonymity and pseudo-anonymity
Sources and recipients of information may wish to remain anonymous for a variety of reasons. The strength to
which anonymity is actually achievable depends on the knowledge of the context i.e. how well the entire

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

messaging system is understood. In large, decentralised systems the messaging system may not be fully
known to any participant, and in many cases the context of the message will change over time.
The concept of anonymity is tied to the concept of unlinkability, where items of interest are no more and no
less related after any observation than they are related from a-priori knowledge.
Relationship anonymity implies a degree of untraceability as to who communicates with whom: thus, it is not
possible to link a originator to the recipient or recipients.
Unobservability is being unable to observe when the originator sends and the recipient receives.
Relationship unobservability means it is not possible to observe the communication between the originator
and the recipient.
Pseudonymity involves the replacing of a person’s name and other identifying characteristics with a label, in
order to prevent identification of the data subject or at least to make such identification substantially difficult.
Being pseudonymous is the state of using a pseudonym as an identification label.
With respect to the degree of linkability, various types of pseudonyms may be possible:
a) Person pseudonym: A person pseudonym is a substitute for the holder’s name which is regarded as
representation for the holder’s civil identity. It may be used in all contexts, e.g., a number of an identity
card, the social security number, DNA, a nickname, the pseudonym of an actor, or a mobile phone
number.
b) Role pseudonym: The use of role pseudonyms is limited to specific roles, e.g., a customer pseudonym or
an Internet account used for many instantiations of the same role “Internet user”. The same role
pseudonym may be used with different communication partners.
c) Relationship pseudonym: For each communication partner, a different pseudonym is used. This means
that different communications partners cannot tell that they are communicating with the same user.
d) Role-relationship pseudonym: For each role and for each communication partner, a different rolerelationship pseudonym is used. This means that the communication partner does not necessarily know,
whether two pseudonyms used in different roles belong to the same holder. On the other hand, two
different communication partners who interact with a user in the same role, do not know from the
pseudonym alone whether it is the same user.
EXAMPLE
Suppose a source of information regularly uses the name “Wool” when communicating information not in
the public domain to Bernstein and “Touched” when communicating the same information to Woodward. Bernstein then
receives information about a new subject from “Deep Throat” and Woodward from “Watergate”. Bernstein and Woodward
do not know if “Deep Throat” and “Watergate” are the same person and also do not know if “Deep Throat” is the same
person as “Wool” or “Touched”, or both.

e) Transaction pseudonym: For each transaction, a transaction pseudonym unlinkable to any other
transaction pseudonyms and at least initially unlinkable to any other transaction pseudonyms is used, e.g.,
randomly generated transaction numbers for online-banking. Therefore, transaction pseudonyms can be
used to realise as strong anonymity as possible.
In general, anonymity of both role pseudonyms and relationship pseudonyms is stronger than anonymity of
person pseudonyms. The strength of anonymity increases with the application of role-relationship
pseudonyms, the use of which is restricted to both the same role and the same relationship.
Anonymity is stronger if less personal data of the pseudonym holder can be linked to the pseudonym.

B.2.3 Reputation engines
The concept of a reputation engine forms the basis of many social media and social networks on the Web.
Reputation engines are used to filter the most relevant information and they become more relevant as the
quantity and variety of information increase dramatically.
A reputation engine can be defined as a formalised set of policies and procedures that are used to compute a
reputation score for an individual based on their past activity. In the online world, a reputation engine is tied to
the idea of a digital footprint. Digital footprints are traces of someone’s activity in a digital environment.
Credit reports and other mechanisms have always provided a means to quantify reputation – but a
comparison of the Web mechanisms of reputation (such as Internet auction ratings) to traditional credit reports
is interesting. As we transact on the Web (buy, sell, borrow, repay) we create digital data. This data is
captured by others (like credit rating agencies) and although it belongs to us – it is ‘owned’ by the credit rating
agency (and indeed we may be charged for accessing it!)
There are more refined form of reputation engines such as the eBay reputation engine 1) . The eBay engine
differs from a credit score because it is transparent. Every feedback (including negative feedbacks) are fed
back to the person about whom the comment is made – thus giving an opportunity for appeal.
A reputation engine could be used to increase trust by incorporating insights from the wider community
sources through tasks like validating new information sources, validating content sources, real time alerts
such as Twitter search and Google alerts, reinforcing trust from unknown sources, complementing search by
external insights, bringing in new/external ideas to the trusted sharing domain, forecasting opportunities and
threats from external sources, etc. However, many current Web 2.0 technologies (like wikis) have limitations
for building trust since they do not have a robust trust model internally.

B.3 Assessing trustworthiness of information
The concepts underpinning trust are intrinsically of a subjective rather than objective nature, and as such are
not necessarily amenable to mechanistic representation. Nonetheless, a Pareto approach [5] can be taken to
the problem: a solution where the majority of the desired result can be achieved with a relatively small amount
of effort, although any attempt to perfect the model would require a disproportionate amount of effort.
Possible components of such an approach are:
a)

That originators of information should assign a degree of trust in information they publish. The usefulness
of this approach has been validated by the United Kingdom’s Centre for Protection of National
Infrastructure, where it is used to automatically profile and disseminate warning information to a variety of
information sharing communities.

b)

That all information be clearly identified with its source, ideally using a structured data format.

c)

Notwithstanding the concept of source identification, there should also be support for anonymous
reporting, as experience from the safety world indicates that provision for anonymity significantly
increases information sharing.

d)

That the concept of a Boundary Object be used to encapsulate the substance of any information
exchanged. Boundary Objects are structured assemblages of information that have a degree of mutual
recognition within a community of interest, and as such both enable communication across linguistic and
domain boundaries: the success of initiatives such as Mitre’s Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE)
notation is attributed in part to their de facto adoption as such Boundary Objects.

That both originator and recipient of a trusted information exchange should provide an assessment as to
whether, and how many times, the information is supportive of previously received content: although
there is some scope for automated parsing of information for this purpose, it has to be recognised that
automated parsing of messages for such purposes within the current state of the art is unreliable. To
minimise the risks of specious reinforcement, a diminishing return Cumulative Distribution Function will
need to be applied to the count of number of previous instances, which will therefore mean that the
weighted value of additional information decreases as the count increases.

f)

That the source or recipient assign a flag as to whether the information has been confirmed
independently, to guard against enshrining so-called urban legends as useful information. This enshrines
a further degree of critical scepticism about information received.

That recipients of information should assign a subjective rating of the source, based on the precepts of
the “5 By 5” model (see B.1).

Suitably weighted, such criteria can enable members of an information sharing community to quantify the trust
they can and should place in the information that they receive from other members of the community. This is
represented pictorially in Figure B.1 above.

Annex C
(informative)
The Traffic Light Protocol

This annex describes the Traffic Light Protocol, a mechanism widely used in information sharing communities
to indicate the permitted distribution of information. Although the basic concept is widely understood, there are
a number of slightly different variations in use. This description is taken from the Good Practice Guide for
Network Security Information Exchanges published by the European Network and Information Security
Agency (ENISA) [6]. The concept was originally developed by the UK’s Centre for the Protection of National
Infrastructure (CPNI).
The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) was created in order to encourage greater sharing of sensitive information
between organizations. The originator needs to signal how widely they want their information to be circulated
beyond the immediate recipient, if at all.
The TLP is based on the concept of the originator labelling information with one of four colours to indicate
what further dissemination, if any, can be undertaken by the recipient. The recipient must consult the
originator if wider dissemination is required.
The four colours and their meanings are as follows:
 RED - Personal for Named Recipients Only. In the context of a meeting, for example, RED information is
limited to those present at the meeting. In most circumstances, RED information will be passed verbally
or in person.
 AMBER - Limited Distribution. The recipient may share AMBER information with others within their
organization, but only on a ‘need-to-know’ basis. The originator may be expected to specify the intended
limits of that sharing.
 GREEN - Community Wide. Information in this category can be circulated widely within a particular
community. However, the information may not be published or posted on the Internet, nor released
outside of the community.
 WHITE – Unlimited. Subject to standard copyright rules, WHITE information may be distributed freely,
without restriction.
Sensitive information howsoever provided by an originator should be marked at the time of disclosure in
accordance with the TLP. All sensitive information will be deemed to be AMBER unless otherwise stated or
written. However, by default and unless specifically stated otherwise at the time of disclosure, the identity of
the source of the sensitive information will always be RED.
The TLP can also be adapted for use within an organization, for example where only some individuals are
granted full access to all shared information. See Figure 2.

Annex D
(informative)
Models for organizing an information sharing community

D.1 Introduction
There are many ways that an information sharing community can be organized, from a loose association of
peered partners to a highly structured and centrally controlled formal legal entity. This annex describes two
forms of community organization that may be found in practice and which support effective information
security management.

D.2 Trusted Information Communication Entities
D.2.1 Introduction
A Trusted Information Communication Entity (TICE) is an autonomous organization that supports information
exchange between members of an information sharing community by acting as a centralised coordination and
communications portal. It can become the core element of an effective information security management
system for inter-sector or inter-organizational communications. A TICE can ensure efficient and secured
information exchanges between members of the information sharing community and assist them in the
capabilities for effective monitoring, analysis and managing the responses to incidents and risks.
A Trusted Information Communication Entity (TICE) is composed of a team of subject matter experts whose
main businesses are to:
 ensure proper information exchanges between the TICE and community members;
 analyze and respond to information security incidents;
 handle incidents and support community members to recover from breaches;
 provide related information security awareness to community members by:


issuing advisories on vulnerabilities in the components in use,

 Informing the representatives of community members about exploits and viruses taking advantage of
these flaws, so the authenticated members could perform efficient components patch and update.
A TICE can act as a trusted intermediary to anonymise the source or recipients of shared information. This
enables members to have confidence that information comes from a trustworthy source, without necessarily
revealing their own identities or placing trust in other members whose identity is concealed.
A TICE may be based on, or developed from, an existing organization such as a Information Security Incident
Response Team (ISIRT), that already serves the relevant community. However, an ISIRT would need to be
expanded to provide proactive TICE services as well as the reactive services generally provided by a ISIRT.

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

D.2.2 TICE organizational considerations
D.2.2.1

Subject matter experts

The structure should consist of public or sector expertise to ensure that the right people with the appropriate
skills are involved, to ensure the experts could determine the relevance of any information within intercommunications and related information infrastructures context.
The experts should be used to conduct analysis, especially in the following domains (but not limited to):
 business management;
 IT security and infrastructure;
 operations;
 internal regulators;
 legal department.
The experts can either be part-time or full-time and may be located at a central site, operational sites, or a
combination of these.
D.2.2.2

Organizational structure

A typical TICE should include as a minimum the following functions:
 Executive Board (essential; those responsible for TICE strategic management and relations with
community members).
 Operational Technical team (essential; those responsible for analyzing business and technical risk issues
and determining appropriate applicability for applying patches or changes).
 Operational Technical correspondents (optional; those recommended to improve the TICE understanding
of the operational environment or the resources involved at the components aggregations level (local
site)).
 Legal experts (optional; but recommended especially during the starting phase of the TICE to mitigate
legal issues).
 Communication experts (optional; those recommended for focusing on translating difficulties related to
technical issues to prepare more understandable messages for members). The communication experts
could provide feedback from community members to the operational technical team, so acting as a
facilitator between these two groups.
D.2.2.3

Community member management

Support should be provided by the TICE to authenticate, evaluate, continually understand and manage the
community members or their representatives to ensure an adequate trusted relationship.
D.2.2.4

Organizational model

The suitable organizational model for a TICE depends highly on the current structures in place, the nature of
community members and the potential for the TICE to be expanded to fulfil the stated services. It also
depends on the accessibility of subject matter experts to be hired permanently or on an ad-hoc basis.

29

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

There are at least three possible models:
 Independent model: an independent TICE is acting as an independent organization, with its own
management and employees.
 Embedded model: an embedded TICE is established within an organization using its resources for
providing services. The number of allocated resources could vary to support the activities during normal
conditions and specific situations.
 Voluntary model. The voluntary TICE is composed by experts that provide advice and support to each
other on a voluntary basis. It should be considered as an experts community, highly dependent on the
motivation of participants.

D.2.3 TICE core and optional services
Selecting the services provided by the TICE to community members is a crucial phase and should be based
on the following elements:
 The scope and risks associated with the proposed communications between members of the information
sharing community;
 The TICE scope, organization and the nature of the information sharing community.
In addition, it highly depends on the role(s) to be assumed by the TICE within the community context (acting
as facilitator and / or initiator of information sharing between members).
Potential TICE core services are:
 Reactive services. Reactive services are designed to detect any potential attacks to the information
infrastructure components, analyze and report attacks and threats impacts, respond to requests for
assistance, reports of incidents to community members.
 Proactive services. Proactive services are designed to ensure and to facilitate adequate information
exchanges by improving security processes of the information sharing community and related information
infrastructures before any incident or event occurs or is detected. In addition, some proactive services are
designed to improve incidents prevention through awareness across the members to reduce their impact
and scope when they do occur.
Potential TICE optional services are:
 Malicious code investigation services. Malicious code investigation services are designed to:


Analyze any file or object found on a component that may be involved in malicious actions.



Handle and disseminate results to community members, vendors and other interested parties, in
order to prevent further spreading of malware and to mitigate the risks.

 Security and quality management services. Security and quality management services are designed to
assist community members in risk analysis, business continuity management and security awareness
with longer term goals.
 Anonymisation services. Anonymisation services are designed to enable community members to send or
receive information without revealing their own identity to other members.

D.2.4 Conclusion
The TICE model provides a comprehensive, controlled and structured model for information sharing between
organizations. It is particularly suited to critical environments where prompt and prioritised information sharing
and analysis is important and members or Government can support the cost of the central infrastructure
required.

D.3 Warning, Advice and Reporting Points
D.3.1 Introduction
The Warning, Advice and Reporting Point (WARP) model [7] has been in use since 2003 and provides a
proven mechanism for sharing of sensitive information between organizations in both the public and private
sectors.
A Warning, Advice and Reporting Point shares information between people or organizations with similar
interests, typically on a voluntary basis. The WARP is based on personal relationships between people
representing the members of the information sharing community. A typical WARP consists of an operator who
knows a little bit about the subject of interest, but is mainly chosen for being good at communicating with
members. There are usually between 20 and 100 members, otherwise the WARP may lose the personal
touch, and the members belong to a community of strong shared interest (small businesses, local government,
service providers, interest groups etc.).
WARP members agree to work together as part of a community and share information to reduce the risk of
their information systems being compromised, and therefore reduce the risk to their organization. This sharing
community could be based on a industry or market sector, geographic location, technology standards, interest
group, risk grouping, or whatever other shared interest makes business sense.
Typically, WARPs are small, personal and ‘Not-for-Profit’.

D.3.2 WARP functions
The WARP operator uses a website, email, telephone, SMS, and occasional meetings (where possible) to
send a personalised service of warnings and advice to the members. This is often IT security advice (because
there’s so much of it, and it changes so rapidly), but can include other material (other threats, e-crime,
contingency planning etc) as well. The operator also taps into the knowledge of the members themselves to
help out other members using a bulletin board, meetings and general communication skills. A successful
WARP builds up enough trust to encourage members to talk about their own incidents & problems,
anonymously, for the benefit of the rest (a bit like a ‘Neighbourhood Watch’ scheme).

D.3.3 WARP services
D.3.3.1

Overview

A WARP normally provides three core services:
 A filtered warning service - where members receive only the security information they need, selected via
an on-line tick-list;
 An advice brokering service - where members can learn from other members’ initiatives and experience,
possibly through a members’ bulletin board;
 A trusted sharing service - where reports are anonymised so that members can learn from each other’s
attacks and incidents, without fear of embarrassment or recrimination.

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

D.3.3.2

Filtered warnings

The Filtered Warnings Service allows WARP members to receive warnings and advisories that are filtered
based upon their area of interest. The Filtered Warnings Application software uses a subscription tree ‘tick list’
which allows WARP members to easily modify and maintain their selections. The software also helps WARP
operators to easily categorise and distribute warnings and advisories in a timely manner. This service delivers
the Warning part of the Warning, Advice and Reporting Point.
D.3.3.3

Advice brokering

This service allows WARP community members to discuss good practice and information security issues in a
secure environment. The service also enables members to offer their experience and skills to others, possibly
on a barter basis, where one has done work in an area that another is contemplating. This service delivers the
Advice part of the Warning, Advice and Reporting Point.
D.3.3.4

Trusted sharing

This service provides a trusted environment in which WARP members can share sensitive information, such
as incident or threat data, in the knowledge that it will not cause them harm or embarrassment. Reporting can
be achieved via the telephone, email or face-to-face, with appropriate security safeguards. Once sanitised,
and anonymised if appropriate, such incident information may also be passed to other WARPs with whom a
trusted relationship exists, and to Government, for collating and monitoring national trends. This service
delivers the Reporting part of the Warning, Advice and Reporting Point.
D.3.3.5

Other services

WARPs may provide other services that are of benefit to their community members. However, such services
are normally kept very simple and straightforward, in order to minimise the time and resources required from
the WARP operator to support them.

D.3.4 Benefits
WARPs deliver effective and low cost information security to members by providing:
 A trusted environment;
 Security information filtering;
 Access to expert advice;
 Early warning of threats;
 Strategic decision support;
 Improved security awareness.
Some of the many potential benefits associated with the establishment of a WARP are:
 Work efficiency: WARPs promote the sharing of information and the coordination of common tasks, which
in turn, will reduce duplication of work. This will benefit a corporate or government provider through
increased efficiency.
 Avoidance of reputation damage: as organizations move to a more online approach to interact with the
public, web presence becomes a key factor. If a website is unavailable or has been defaced, this can
cause reputation issues and could discourage the uptake of web services. The community served will be
better protected by being WARP members.

 Early warning: Finding out about problems and solutions others are experiencing, and sharing these
within the WARP community will facilitate a unique and personalised service, which even a large
commercial provider could not match.
 Support from Government and other WARPs: The advantage of belonging to such a focused community
means the ability to share and distribute helpful advice from a trusted source. Operational support from
other WARPs is well established through the WARP Operators Forum. There is also peer-to-peer
cooperation through the Filtered Warnings Application which enables distribution of other WARPs'
warnings and advisories easily.
 Low cost: The model is designed to be very low cost, through minimal staffing levels (or virtual teams).
 Comprehensive free Toolbox: A WARP provider has access to the WARP Toolbox, which has been
created from the experience of existing WARPs. It includes background information, how to get started,
how to build and run a WARP, and an extensive list of downloads, from press articles to marketing
materials.
 Sustainability: WARPs are now becoming widely established, with many respected organizations
successfully adopting the approach with proven sustainability.
 Software: WARP providers may have access to specialist software developed to support all three WARP
services.
 Increased credibility: The ‘Not-for-Profit’ ethos, and the association with existing best practice, will help
gain the community’s trust and can aid an organization’s credibility, especially in the context of ‘Public
Good’ activities.
 Compliance: WARP membership will help member organizations satisfy the organizational contact
controls identified within ISO/IEC 27002:2005.
 Growth potential: Many existing WARP providers are in the process of establishing further WARPs,
building on the existing infrastructure and expertise which both supports lower costs and better
sustainability. WARPs are now appearing across many sectors, and are beginning to spread
internationally.
 Corporate Social Responsibility: Being a WARP member enhances the member organization’s corporate
social responsibility thereby gaining the community’s trust and potentially supporting both the operator’s
and the members’ other business strategies.

D.3.5 Conclusion
The WARP model provides a simple, collaborative model for information sharing between like-minded
organizations. It is particularly suited to situations where funding is limited and the central infrastructure must
be provided and run on a voluntary basis.
