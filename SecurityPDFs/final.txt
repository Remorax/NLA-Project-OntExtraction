This British Standard has been developed by practitioners throughout
the business continuity community, drawing upon their academic,
technical and practical experiences of business continuity
management (BCM). It has been produced to provide a system based
on good practice for business continuity management. It is intended
to serve as a single reference point for most situations where business
continuity management is practised, and to be used by large, medium
and small organizations in industrial, commercial, public and voluntary
sectors.
This document constitutes Part 1 of BS 25999. At the time of
publication, Part 2 was in preparation which will specify requirements
for business continuity management.

As a code of practice, this British Standard takes the form of guidance
and recommendations. It should not be quoted as if it were a
specification and particular care should be taken to ensure that claims
of compliance are not misleading.
Any user claiming compliance with this British Standard is expected to
be able to justify any course of action that deviates from its
recommendations.

Presentational conventions
The provisions of this Standard are recommendations, which are
expressed in sentences in which the principal auxiliary verb is “should”.
Clause 3 does not contain any recommendations; rather, it gives useful
background information on business continuity management (though
the Standard is not intended as a beginner’s guide to business continuity
management).
The word “may” is used in the text to express permissibility, e.g. as an
alternative to the primary recommendation of the clause. The word
“can” is used to express possibility, e.g. a consequence of an action or
an event.
Supplementary commentary, explanation and general
informative material is presented in smaller italic type, and does
not constitute a normative element.

Contractual and legal considerations
This publication does not purport to include all the necessary provisions
of a contract. Users are responsible for its correct application.
Compliance with a British Standard cannot confer immunity
from legal obligations.

1 Scope and applicability
This British Standard establishes the process, principles and
terminology of business continuity management (BCM). The
purpose of this Standard is to provide a basis for understanding,
developing and implementing business continuity within an
organization and to provide confidence in the organization's dealings
with customers and other organizations. It also enables the organization
to measure its BCM capability in a consistent and recognized manner.
This Standard provides a system based on BCM good practice.
This Standard is intended for use by anyone with responsibility for
business operations or the provision of services, from top management
through all levels of the organization; from those with a single site to
those with a global presence; from sole traders and small-to-medium
enterprises (SMEs) to organizations employing thousands of people. It
is therefore applicable to anybody who holds responsibility for any
operation, and thus the continuity of that operation.
This Standard does not cover the activities of emergency planning
inasmuch as that topic relates to civil emergencies.
NOTE Ultimately, no matter how much effort or resource is invested in
business continuity management, an organization could still be faced with
an incident or combination of incidents it did not forsee.

2 Terms and definitions
For the purposes of this part of BS 25999, the following definitions
apply.

2.1

activity
process or set of processes undertaken by an organization (or on its
behalf) that produces or supports one or more products or services
NOTE Examples of such processes include accounts, call centre, IT,
manufacture, distribution.

2.2

business continuity
strategic and tactical capability of the organization to plan for and
respond to incidents and business disruptions in order to continue
business operations at an acceptable pre-defined level

2.3

business continuity management (BCM)
holistic management process that identifies potential threats to an
organization and the impacts to business operations that those threats,
if realized, might cause, and which provides a framework for building
organizational resilience with the capability for an effective response
that safeguards the interests of its key stakeholders, reputation, brand
and value-creating activities
NOTE Business continuity management involves managing the
recovery or continuation of business activities in the event of a business
disruption, and management of the overall programme through training,
exercises and reviews, to ensure the business continuity plan(s) stays
current and up-to-date.

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

NOTE 2 The word “probability” can be used instead of “likelihood” in some
non-English languages that have no direct equivalent. Because
“probability” is often interpreted more formally in English as a
mathematical term, “likelihood” is used throughout this Standard with the
intention that it is given the same broad interpretation as “probability”.

2.28

risk

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

something that might happen and its effect(s) on the achievement of
objectives
NOTE 1 The word “risk” is used colloquially in various ways, as a noun
(“a risk” or, in the plural, “risks”), a verb (to risk [something], or to put at
risk), or as an adjective (“risky”). Used as a noun the term “a risk” could
relate to either a potential event, its causes, the chance (likelihood) of
something happening, or the effects of such events. In risk management
(see 6.5) it is important to make a clear distinction between these various
usages of the word “risk”.
NOTE 2 Risk is defined relative to a particular objective; therefore,
concern for several objectives implies the possibility of more than one
measure of risk with respect to any source of risk.
NOTE 3 Risk is often quantified as an average effect by summing the
combined effect of each possible consequence weighted by the associated
likelihood of each consequence, to obtain an “expected value”. However,
probability distributions are needed to quantify perceptions about the
range of possible consequences. Alternatively, summary statistics, such as
standard deviation, may be used in addition to expected value.

2.29

risk appetite
total amount of risk that an organization is prepared to accept, tolerate
or be exposed to at any point in time

2.30

risk assessment
overall process of risk identification, analysis and evaluation

2.31

risk management
structured development and application of management culture, policy,
procedures and practices to the tasks of identifying, analysing,
evaluating, and controlling responding to risk

2.32

stakeholders
those with a vested interest in an organization’s achievements
NOTE This is a wide-ranging term that includes, but is not limited to,
internal and “outsourced” employees, customers, suppliers, partners,
employees, distributors, investors, insurers, shareholders, owners,
government and regulators.

2.33

top management
person or group of people who direct and control an organization at the
highest level [BS EN ISO 9000:2005]
NOTE Top management, especially in a large multinational
organization, might not be directly involved; however, top management
accountability through the chain of command is manifest. In a small
organization, top management might be the owner or sole proprietor.

3 Overview of business continuity
management (BCM)
3.1

What is BCM?

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

Business continuity management (BCM) is a business-owned,
business-driven process that establishes a fit-for-purpose strategic and
operational framework that:
•

proactively improves an organization’s resilience against the
disruption of its ability to achieve its key objectives;

•

provides a rehearsed method of restoring an organization’s ability
to supply its key products and services to an agreed level within
an agreed time after a disruption; and

•

delivers a proven capability to manage a business disruption and
protect the organization’s reputation and brand.

While the individual processes of business continuity can change with
an organization’s size, structures and responsibilities, the basic
principles remain exactly the same for voluntary, private or public
sector organizations, regardless of their size, scope or complexity.

3.2

BCM and organizational strategy
All organizations, whether large or small, have aims and objectives, such
as to grow, to provide services and to acquire other businesses. These
aims and objectives are generally met via strategic plans to achieve an
organization’s short, medium and long term goals. BCM understanding
at an organization’s highest level will ensure that these aims and
objectives are not compromised by unexpected disruptions.
The consequences of an incident vary and can be far-reaching. These
consequences might involve loss of life, loss of assets or income, or the
inability to deliver products and services on which the organization’s
strategy, reputation or even survival might depend.
BCM needs to recognize the strategic importance of known
stakeholders. Furthermore, as the consequences of a disruption
unfold, new stakeholders emerge and have a direct impact on the
eventual extent of the damage. For example, issue groups may attempt
to apply pressure on the organization facing a disruption.
All these issues are of strategic concern to the organization.

3.3

BCM – the relationship with risk management
BCM is complementary to a risk management framework that sets out
to understand the risks to operations or business, and the consequences
of those risks.
Risk management seeks to manage risk around the key products and
services that an organization delivers. Product and service delivery can
be disrupted by a wide variety of incidents, many of which are difficult
to predict or analyse by cause.

6 • © BSI 2006

BS 25999-1:2006

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

By focusing on the impact of disruption, BCM identifies those products
and services on which the organization depends for its survival, and can
identify what is required for the organization to continue to meet its
obligations. Through BCM, an organization can recognize what needs to
be done before an incident occurs to protect its people, premises,
technology, information, supply chain, stakeholders and reputation.
With that recognition, the organization can then take a realistic view on
the responses that are likely to be needed as and when a disruption
occurs, so that it can be confident that it will manage through any
consequences without unacceptable delay in delivering its products or
services.
An organization with appropriate BCM measures in place might be able
to take advantage of opportunities which have a high risk.

3.4

Why an organization should undertake BCM
BCM forms an important element of good business management,
service provision and entrepreneurial prudence.
Managers and owners have the responsibility to maintain the ability of
the organization to function without disruption. Organizations
constantly make commitments or have a duty to deliver products and
services, i.e. they enter into contracts and otherwise raise expectations.
All organizations have moral and social responsibilities, particularly
where they provide an emergency response or a public or voluntary
service. In some cases, organizations have statutory or regulatory duties
to undertake BCM.
All business activity is subject to disruptions, such as technology failure,
flooding, utility disruption and terrorism. BCM provides the capability
to adequately react to operational disruptions while protecting welfare
and safety.
BCM ought now to be regarded, not as a costly planning process, but as
one that adds value to the organization.

3.5

The benefits of an effective BCM programme
The benefits of an effective BCM programme are that the organization:
•

is able to proactively identify the impacts of an operational
disruption;

•

has in place an effective response to disruptions which minimizes
the impact on the organization;

•

maintains an ability to manage uninsurable risks;

•

encourages cross-team working;

•

is able to demonstrate a credible response through a process of
exercising;

•

could enhance its reputation; and

•

might gain a competitive advantage, conferred by the
demonstrated ability to maintain delivery.

3.6

The outcomes of an effective BCM programme

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

The outcomes of an effective BCM programme are that:

3.7

•

key products and services are identified and protected, ensuring
their continuity;

•

an incident management capability is enabled to provide an
effective response;

•

the organization’s understanding of itself and its relationships with
other organizations, relevant regulators or government
departments, local authorities and the emergency services is
properly developed, documented and understood;

•

staff are trained to respond effectively to an incident or disruption
through appropriate exercising;

•

stakeholder requirements are understood and able to be delivered;

•

staff receive adequate support and communications in the event of
a disruption;

•

the organization’s supply chain is secured;

•

the organization’s reputation is protected; and

•

the organization remains compliant with its legal and regulatory
obligations.

Elements of the business continuity
management lifecycle
The BCM lifecycle comprises six elements, as illustrated by Figure 1.
These can be implemented by organizations of all sizes, in all sectors:
public, private, non-profit, educational, manufacturing, etc. The scope
and structure of a BCM programme can vary, and the effort expended
will be tailored to the needs of the individual organization, but these
essential elements still have to be undertaken.
a) BCM programme management (see Clause 5)
Programme management enables the business continuity capability to
be both established (if necessary) and maintained in a manner
appropriate to the size and complexity of the organization.
b) Understanding the organization (see Clause 6)
The activities associated with “Understanding the organization” provide
information that enables prioritization of an organization’s products
and services and the urgency of the activities that are required to deliver
them. This sets the requirements that will determine the selection of
appropriate BCM strategies.

c) Determining business continuity strategy (see Clause 7)
Determining business continuity strategy enables a range of strategies
to be evaluated. This allows an appropriate response to be chosen for
each product or service, such that the organization can continue to
deliver those products and services:
•

at an acceptable level of operation; and

•

within an acceptable timeframe

during and following a disruption. The choice made will take account of
the resilience and countermeasure options already present within the
organization.

BS 25999-1:2006
COMMENTARY ON 3.7d)
The term “incident” is used
throughout this Standard to reflect
the scalability of events, from small
to large which can affect an
organization. A single incident or
series of incidents can result in
serious disruptions to the
organization’s ability to meet its
obligations. If an incident is
managed well it might not develop
into a crisis. However, some events
will cause such a profound
disruption to the organization’s
objectives as to be considered a
crisis immediately.
An incident might exceed the
preparedness of an organization,
even if it has carefully examined
response measures against an
anticipated level of damage. It is
therefore imperative that
management and its supporting
structures do not adhere stubbornly
to an existing plan, but make
judgments according to the
circumstances. A business
continuity plan is never a
substitute for informed and
competent management
decision-making.

d) Developing and implementing a BCM response (see Clause 8)
Developing and implementing a BCM response results in the creation of
a management framework and a structure of incident management,
business continuity and business recovery plans that detail the steps to
be taken during and after an incident to maintain or restore operations.
e) BCM exercising, maintaining and reviewing BCM
arrangements (see Clause 9)
BCM exercising, maintenance, review and audit leads to the
organization being able to:
•

demonstrate the extent to which its strategies and plans are
complete, current and accurate; and

•

identify opportunities for improvement.

f) Embedding BCM in the organization’s culture (see Clause 10)
Embedding BCM in the organization’s culture enables BCM to
become part of the organization’s core values and instils confidence
in all stakeholders in the ability of the organization to cope with
disruptions.

4 The business continuity management
policy
4.1
COMMENTARY ON 4.1
The purposes of establishing a
business continuity policy are to:
w
ensure that all BCM activities
are conducted and
implemented in an agreed and
controlled manner;
w
achieve a business continuity
capability that meets changing
business needs and is
appropriate to the size,
complexity and nature of the
organization; and
w
put in place a clearly defined
framework for the ongoing BCM
capability.

10 • © BSI 2006

Overview
4.1.1 The BCM policy defines the following processes:
•

the set-up activities for establishing a business continuity
capability; and

•

the ongoing management and maintenance of the business
continuity capability.

4.1.2 The set-up activities incorporate the specification, end-to-end
design, build, implementation and initial exercising of the business
continuity capability.
4.1.3 The ongoing maintenance and management activities include
embedding business continuity within the organization, exercising
plans regularly, and updating and communicating them, particularly
when there is significant change in premises, personnel, process,
market, technology or organizational structure.

BS 25999-1:2006

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

4.2

Context
The organization should ensure that its BCM policy is appropriate to the
nature, scale, complexity, geography and criticality of its business
activities and that it reflects its culture, dependencies and operating
environment. The BCM policy defines the process requirements to
ensure that business continuity arrangements continue to meet the
needs of the organization in the event of an incident. This policy should
ensure that a business continuity capability is promoted within the
organization’s culture. The BCM capability should be integrated into the
organization’s change management activity so that it is incorporated
into the growth and development of the organization’s products and
services.

4.3

Development of the business continuity policy
The organization should develop its business continuity policy which
states the objectives of BCM within the organization. Initially, this may
be a high level statement of intent which is refined and enhanced as the
capability is developed.
The business continuity policy should provide the organization with
documented principles to which it will aspire and against which its
business continuity capability should be measured. The BCM policy
should be owned at a high level, e.g. a board director or elected
representative.
The organization may consider the following when developing its BCM
policy:
•

defining the scope of BCM within the organization;

•

BCM resourcing;

•

defining the BCM principles, guidelines and minimum standards
for the organization;

•

referencing any relevant standards, regulations or policies that
have to be included or can be used as a benchmark.

The organization should maintain and regularly review its BCM policy,
strategies, plans and solutions on a regular basis in line with the
organization's needs.
The scope of the BCM policy should clearly define any limitations or
exclusions that apply, e.g. geographical or product exclusions.

4.4

Scope of the BCM programme
Top management may determine the scope of the BCM programme by
identifying the key products and services that support the
organization’s objectives, obligations and statutory duties.
Determination of what is key should be consistent with the business
impact analysis described in 6.2, albeit at a higher level of
consideration.

Outsourced activities

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

If a product, service or activity has been outsourced, the risk
accountability for that product, service or activity remains vested within
the organization. Consequently, an organization should assure itself that
its key suppliers or outsource partners have effective BCM
arrangements in place. One method of doing this is to obtain audited
evidence of the viability of key suppliers’ continuity plans and their
exercising and maintenance programmes.

culture.

5.1

Overview
A BCM programme should be put in place to achieve the objectives
defined in the business continuity policy (see 4.3). BCM programme
management involves three steps:

5.2

•

assigning responsibilities (see 5.2);

•

implementing business continuity in the organization (see 5.3);
and

•

the ongoing management of business continuity (see 5.4).

Assigning responsibilities (governance)
5.2.1 The organization’s management should:
•

appoint or nominate a person with appropriate seniority and
authority to be accountable for BCM policy and implementation;
and

•

appoint or nominate one or more individuals to implement and
maintain the BCM programme.

COMMENTARY ON 5.2.1
Individuals tasked with implementing and maintaining the business
continuity programme may reside in many areas of an organization
depending on its size, scale and complexity. It is essential, however, that
a person with appropriate authority (e.g. owner, board director or elected
representative) has overall responsibility for BCM and is directly
accountable for ensuring the continued success of this capability.

5.2.2 If the organization’s structure so indicates, top management may
nominate representatives across the business by function or location to
assist in the implementation of the BCM programme.
The roles, accountabilities, responsibilities and authorities should be
integrated into job descriptions and skill sets.
The organization’s audit process should review these responsibilities.

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

These responsibilities may be reinforced by including them in the
organization’s appraisal, reward and recognition policy.
COMMENTARY ON 5.2.2
In large organizations there might be a need for a team of business
continuity representatives with differing roles and responsibilities. In
smaller organizations, responsibility for business continuity may reside
with one or more individuals.

5.3

Implementing business continuity in the
organization
5.3.1 Activities to implement a business continuity programme should
include the design, build, and implementation of the programme.
The organization should:
•

communicate the programme to stakeholders;

•

arrange or provide appropriate training for staff; and

•

exercise the business continuity capability (see Clause 9).

5.3.2 The organization may adopt a recognized project management
method to ensure that the implementation is effectively managed

5.4
5.4.1

Ongoing management
Overview
Ongoing management activities should ensure that business continuity
is embedded within the organization. Each component of an
organization’s business continuity capability should be regularly
reviewed, exercised and updated. In addition, business continuity
arrangements and plans should also be reviewed and updated whenever
there is a significant change in the organization’s operating
environment, personnel, processes or technology, and when an exercise
or incident highlights deficiencies.

5.4.2

Ongoing maintenance
However BCM is resourced, there are activities that should be carried
out both initially and on an ongoing basis. These may include:

14 • © BSI 2006

•

defining the scope, roles and responsibilities for BCM;

•

appointing an appropriate person or team to manage the ongoing
BCM capability;

•

keeping the business continuity programme current through good
practice;

•

promoting business continuity across the organization and wider,
where appropriate;

•

administering the exercise programme;

5.5

•

coordinating the regular review and update of the business
continuity capability, including reviewing or reworking risk
assessments and business impact analyses (BIAs);

•

maintaining documentation appropriate to the size and complexity
of the organization (see 5.5);

•

monitoring performance of the business continuity capability;

•

managing costs associated with the business continuity capability;
and

•

establishing and monitoring change management and succession
management regimes.

BCM documentation
Individuals tasked with maintaining business continuity should create
and maintain the business continuity documentation. This may include
the following:
a) BCM policy:
•

BCM scope statement,

•

BCM terms of reference;

b) business impact analysis (BIA);
c)

risk and threat assessment;

d) BCM strategy/strategies;
e)

awareness programme;

f)

training programme;

g) incident management plans;
h) business continuity plans;
i)

business recovery plans;

j)

exercise schedule and reports;

k) service level agreements and contracts.

Exercising,

and reviewing

The aim of this element of the BCM lifecycle is to assist the
understanding of the organization through the identification of
its key products and services and the critical activities and
resources that support them. This element ensures that the
BCM programme is aligned to the organization’s objectives,
obligations and statutory duties.

6.1

Introduction
6.1.1 In a business continuity context, an understanding of the
organization comes from:
•

identifying the organization’s objectives, stakeholder obligations,
statutory duties and the environment in which the organization
operates;

•

identifying the activities, assets and resources, including those
outside the organization, that support the delivery of these
products and services;

•

assessing the impact and consequences over time of the failure of
these activities, assets and resources (see 6.2);

•

identifying and evaluating the perceived threats that could disrupt
the organization’s key products and services and the critical
activities, assets and resources that support them (see 6.5).

6.1.2 It is important that the organization understands:
a) the interdependencies of its activities, and
b) any reliance it has on external organizations, and any reliance
placed upon it by others.

6.2

Business impact analysis (BIA)
6.2.1 The organization should determine and document the impact of
a disruption to the activities that support its key products and
services. This process is commonly referred to as a business impact
analysis (BIA).

16 • © BSI 2006

BS 25999-1:2006
6.2.2 For each activity supporting the delivery of key products and
services within the scope of its BCM programme, the organization
should:

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

a) assess over time the impacts that would occur if the activity was
disrupted;
COMMENTARY ON 6.2.2b)
During a disruption, impacts
generally increase over time and
affect each activity differently.
Impacts might also vary depending
on the day, month or point in the
business lifecycle.

b) establish the maximum tolerable period of disruption of each
activity by identifying:

c)

•

the maximum time period after the start of a disruption within
which the activity needs to be resumed,

•

the minimum level at which the activity needs to be performed
on its resumption,

•

the length of time within which normal levels of operation
need to be resumed;

identify any inter-dependent activities, assets, supporting
infrastructure or resources that have also to be maintained
continuously or recovered over time.

6.2.3 When assessing impacts, the organization should consider those
that relate to its business aims and objectives and its stakeholders.
These may include:
•

the impact on staff or public wellbeing;

•

the impact of damage to, or loss of, premises, technology or
information;

•

the impact of breaches of statutory duties or regulatory
requirements;

•

damage to reputation;

•

damage to financial viability;

•

deterioration of product or service quality;

•

environmental damage.

The organization should document its approach to assessing the impact
of disruption and its findings and conclusions.

6.3
COMMENTARY ON 6.3
The maximum time period for
resuming activities can vary
between seconds and several
months depending on the nature of
the activity. Activities that are
time-sensitive might need to be
specified with a great degree of
accuracy, e.g. to the minute or the
hour. Less time-sensitive activities
might require less accuracy.

Identification of critical activities
The organization may categorize its activities according to their priority
for recovery. Those activities whose loss, as identified during the BIA,
would have the greatest impact in the shortest time and which need to
be recovered most rapidly may be termed “critical activities”. Each
critical activity supports one or more key products or services.
The organization may wish to focus its planning activities on critical
activities, but should recognize that other activities will also need to be
recovered within their maximum tolerable period of disruption and
might also require advance arrangements to be in place.

The maximum tolerable period of
disruption will influence each
activity’s recovery time objective
when determining BCM strategies
(see Clause 7).

6.4
COMMENTARY ON 6.4
Technology implies the use of
equipment in the broadest sense
and as relevant to the
organization. Technology might
include, but is not limited to, IT
software and hardware,
telecommunications equipment,
lathes, food preparation machines,
vacuum sealing machinery or any
other plant and machinery
essential to manufacturing and
production capability.
If records or work-in-progress
information are unavailable,
inaccurate, or not
sufficiently up-to-date, this could
prevent or critically delay the
resumption of activities. The
requirements for providing such
information are used to formulate
appropriate back-up and records
management strategies when
determining BCM strategies (see
Clause 7).

6.5
COMMENTARY ON 6.5
It might be beneficial to consult
risk registers that have already
been established elsewhere in the
organization or by external bodies.

Determining continuity requirements
The organization should estimate the resources that each activity will
require on resumption. These may include:
a) staff resources, including numbers, skills and knowledge (people);
b) the works site and facilities required (premises);
c) supporting technology, plant and equipment (technology);
d) provision of information (whether electronic or paper-based)
about previous work or current work-in-progress, all of which is
sufficiently up-to-date and accurate to allow the activity to
continue effectively at the agreed level (information); and
e) external services and suppliers (supplies).
The organization should take into account the needs of stakeholders
when determining resource levels.

Evaluating threats to critical activities
(undertaking a risk assessment)
6.5.1 In a BCM context, the level of risk should be understood
specifically in respect of the organization’s critical activities and the
risk of a disruption to these. Critical activities are underpinned by
resources such as people, premises, technology, information, supplies
and stakeholders. The organization should understand the threats to
these resources, the vulnerabilities of each resource, and the impact
that would arise if a threat became an incident and caused a business
disruption.
6.5.2 It is entirely the decision of the organization which risk
assessment approach is chosen, but it is important that the approach is
suitable and appropriate to address all of the organization’s
requirements.
6.5.3 BS ISO/IEC 27001 sets the framework for the risk assessment
approach to be chosen by describing the mandatory elements that the
risk assessment process should contain. Typical elements are as
follows.

18 • © BSI 2006

•

Determination of the criteria for risk acceptance. These describe
the circumstances under which the organization is willing to
accept risks.

•

Identification of acceptable levels of risk. Whatever risk
assessment approach is chosen, the organization needs to identify
the levels of risk that it considers acceptable.

BS 25999-1:2006
•

Analysis of the risks. It is necessary that the organization's risk
assessment approach addresses all the concepts discussed in
6.5.4, 6.5.5 and 6.5.6.

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

6.5.4 Specific threats may be described as events or actions which
could, at some point, cause an impact to the resources, e.g. threats
such as fire, flood, power failure, staff loss, staff absenteeism,
computer viruses and hardware failure.
6.5.5 Vulnerabilities might occur as weaknesses within the resources
and can, at some point be exploited by the threats, e.g. single points of
failure, inadequacies in fire protection, electrical resilience, staffing
levels, IT security and IT resilience.
6.5.6 Impacts (see 6.2.3) might result from the exploitation of
vulnerabilities by threats.

6.6
6.6.1

Determining choices
Overview
As a result of the BIA and the risk assessment, the organization should
identify measures that:
•

reduce the likelihood of a disruption;

•

shorten the period of disruption; and

•

limit the impact of a disruption on the organization’s key products
and services.

These measures are known as loss mitigation and risk treatment.
Loss mitigation strategies can be used in conjunction with other
options, as not all risks can be prevented or reduced to an acceptable
level. The organization might include one or more or all of the strategies
in 6.6.2 to 6.6.5 for each critical activity.

6.6.2

Business continuity
If business continuity is the chosen strategy for a key product or service,
a recovery time objective (RTO) should be established and the
continuity strategies in Clause 7 should be evaluated against this
objective.
Continuity strategies seek to improve the organization’s resilience to a
disruption by ensuring critical activities continue at, or are recovered
to, an acceptable minimum level and to timeframes stipulated within
the BIA.

© BSI 2006 •

19

BS 25999-1:2006
6.6.3

Acceptance

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

A risk might be acceptable without any further action being taken. Even
if it is not acceptable, the ability to do anything about some risks could
be limited, or the cost of taking any action disproportionate to the
potential benefit gained. In these cases the response may be to tolerate
the existing level of risk if top management deems the risk to be
acceptable and within the organization’s risk appetite. In some
circumstances the impact of a risk might be outside the organization’s
normal risk appetite, but, due to the low likelihood of the risk occurring
and/or the uneconomic cost of control, top management may accept the
risk.
Acceptance may be supplemented by a plan for handling the impacts
that will arise if the risk is realized.

6.6.4

Transfer
For some risks the best response may be to transfer them. This might
be done by conventional insurance or contractual arrangements, or it
might be done by paying a third party to take the risk in another way.
This option is particularly good for mitigating financial risks or risks to
assets. Risks may be transferred in order to reduce the risk exposure of
the organization or because another organization is more capable of
effectively managing the risk. It is important to note that some risks are
not (fully) transferable; in particular, it is generally not possible to
transfer reputational risk, even if the delivery of a service is contracted
out.
The purchase of insurance may form part of a risk treatment strategy
and will provide some financial recompense for some losses. However,
not all losses are fully insurable (e.g. uninsured incidents, damage to
brand or reputation, loss of stakeholder value, reduction in market
share and human consequences). A financial settlement alone is unlikely
to fully protect the organization in a manner that satisfies stakeholder
expectations. Insurance cover is more likely to be used in conjunction
with one or more other strategies.

6.6.5

Change, suspend or terminate
In some circumstances it might be appropriate to change, suspend or
terminate the service, product, activity, function or process. This option
ought only to be considered where there is no conflict with the
organization’s objectives, statutory compliance and stakeholder
expectation. This approach is most likely to be considered where a
service, product, activity, function or process has a limited lifespan.
NOTE The four items above are sometimes referred to as the “4 T” model:
“Treat” (business continuity), “Tolerate” (accept the risk), “Transfer” and
“Terminate”.

6.7

Sign-off
Top management should sign off the documented list of key products
and services, the business impact analysis and the risk assessment to
ensure that the work has been appropriate and is a true reflection of the
organization.

7.1
COMMENTARY ON 7.1
Clause 7 and all following clauses
relate to those key products and
services for which business
continuity is the chosen option. In
all other cases (e.g. suspension,
termination, acceptance of risk),
the product or service is not
covered by a BCM approach and
cannot be considered compliant
with this Standard.

7.2

Introduction
The organization’s approach to determining BCM strategies should:
a) implement appropriate measures to reduce the likelihood of
incidents occurring and/or reduce the potential effects of those
incidents;
b) take due account of the resilience and mitigation measures;
c)

provide continuity for its critical activities during and following an
incident; and

d) take account of those activities that have not been identified as
critical.

Strategy options
7.2.1 The organization should consider strategic options for its critical
activities and the resources that each activity will require on its
resumption. The most appropriate strategy or strategies will depend on
a range of factors such as:
•

the maximum tolerable period of disruption of the critical activity;

•

the costs of implementing a strategy or strategies; and

•

the consequences of inaction.

7.2.2 Strategies might be required for the following organizational
resources:
•

people (see 7.3);

•

premises (see 7.4);

•

technology (see 7.5);

•

information (see 7.6);

•

supplies (see 7.7); and

•

stakeholders (see 7.8).
© BSI 2006 •

21

BS 25999-1:2006
In each case, the organization should minimize the likelihood of
implementing a business continuity solution that might be affected by
the same incident that causes the business disruption.

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

7.3

People
The organization should identify appropriate strategies for maintaining
core skills and knowledge. This analysis should extend beyond
employees to contractors and other stakeholders who possess extensive
specialist skills and knowledge. Strategies to protect or provide those
skills might include:
a) documentation of the way in which critical activities are
performed;
b) multi-skill training of staff and contractors;
c) separation of core skills to reduce the concentration of risk
(this might entail physical separation of staff with core skills or
ensuring that more than one person has the requisite core skills);
d) use of third parties;
e) succession planning; and
f)

7.4
COMMENTARY ON 7.4
Worksite strategies can vary
significantly and a range of
options might be available.
Different types of incident or threat
might require the implementation
of different or multiple worksite
options. The correct strategies will
in part be determined by the
organization’s size, sector and
spread of activities, by
stakeholders, and by geographical
base. For example, public
authorities will need to maintain a
frontline service delivery in their
communities.

knowledge retention and management.

Premises
The organization should devise a strategy for reducing the impact of the
unavailability of its normal worksite(s). This may include one or more
of the following:
a) alternative premises (locations) within the organization, including
displacement of other activities;
b) alternative premises provided by other organizations (whether or
not these are reciprocal arrangements);
c) alternative premises provided by third-party specialists;
d) working from home or at remote sites;
e) other agreed suitable premises; and
f)

use of an alternative workforce in an established site.

NOTE 1 If staff are to be moved to alternative premises, these premises
ought to be close enough that staff are willing and able to travel there,
taking into account any possible difficulties caused by the incident.
However, the alternative premises ought not to be so close that they are
likely to be affected by the same incident.
NOTE 2 The use of alternative premises for continuity purposes ought to
be supported by a clear statement as to whether the alternative premises
are for the sole use of the organization. If the alternative premises are
shared with other organizations, a plan to mitigate the non-availability of
these premises ought to be developed and documented.
NOTE 3 It may be appropriate to move the workload rather than the staff,
e.g. a manufacturing line or a call centre’s workload.

7.5

Technology

COMMENTARY ON 7.5.1
Technology strategies will vary
significantly between
organizations according to the size,
nature and complexity of business.
Specific strategies ought to be
developed to safeguard, replace or
restore specialized or custom built
technologies with long lead times.

7.5.1 Technology strategies will depend on the nature of the
technology employed and its relationship to critical activities, but will
typically be one or a combination of the following:

The organization may need to
make provision for manual
operations before full technology
services are recovered.

•

geographical spread of technology, i.e. maintaining the same
technology at different locations that will not be affected by the
same business disruption;

•

holding older equipment as emergency replacement or spares; and

•

additional risk mitigation for unique or long lead time equipment.

•

provision made within the organization;

•

services delivered to the organization; and

•

services provided externally by a third party.

7.5.2 Technology strategies may include:

7.5.3 Information technology (IT) services frequently need complex
continuity strategies. Where such strategies are required,
consideration should be given to:
•

recovery time objectives (RTOs) for systems and applications
which support the key activities identified in the BIA;

•

location and distance between technology sites;

•

number of technology sites;

•

remote access;

•

the use of un-staffed (dark) sites as opposed to staffed sites;

•

telecoms connectivity and redundant routing;

•

the nature of “failover” (whether manual intervention is required to
activate alternative IT provision or whether this needs to occur
automatically); and

•

third-party connectivity and external links.

NOTE 1 If a strategy of “failing over” from one site to another is adopted,
the network path distance between the two sites has to be carefully
considered as the distance between the sites could have a negative impact
on the way in which IT systems operate.
NOTE 2 Where more than one site hosts an organization’s IT, there may
be a mutual IT recovery strategy, so that the systems, network and storage
at each site is sized to cope with the combined traffic and work of the
other(s) in addition to its own work.
NOTE 3 Another solution to relocating people to alternative premises is
to provide them with remote access to IT via dial-up, or through the
Internet using Virtual Private Network (VPN) or similar technology.
NOTE 4 Further guidance on continuity for IT and telecommunications
hardware may be found in such documents as PAS 77, BS ISO/IEC 27001
and BS ISO/IEC 20000 (both parts).

© BSI 2006 •

23

BS 25999-1:2006
7.6

Information
Information strategies should be such as to ensure that information vital
to the organization’s operation is protected and recoverable according
to the timeframes described within the BIA.

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

NOTE 1 Further guidance is given in BS ISO/IEC 27001. The storage
and recovery of such information has to be compliant with relevant
legislation.

Any information required for enabling the delivery of the organization’s
critical activities should have appropriate:
•

confidentiality;

•

integrity;

•

availability; and

•

currency.

Information strategies should be documented for the recovery of
information that has not yet been copied or backed-up to a safe location.
•

Information strategies should extend to include:

•

physical (hardcopy) formats; and

•

virtual (electronic) formats, etc.

NOTE 2 In all cases, information needs to be recovered to a point in time
that is known and agreed by top management. Various methods of copying
may be used, such as electronic or tape backups, microfiche, photocopies,
creating dual copies at the time of production and so on. This known
recovery point is often referred to as the “recovery point objective”.

7.7
COMMENTARY ON 7.7
In office-based environments,
supplies might constitute cheques,
etc. Other industries might identify
retail stock or just-in-time supplies,
or vehicle fuels.

Supplies
7.7.1 The organization should identify and maintain an inventory of the
core supplies that support its critical activities. Strategies to provide
these may include:
•

storage of additional supplies at another location;

•

arrangements with third parties for delivery of stock at short
notice;

•

diversion of just-in-time deliveries to other locations;

•

holding of materials at warehouses or shipping sites;

•

transfer of sub-assembly operations to an alternative location
which has supplies; and

•

identification of alternative/substitute supplies.

7.7.2 Where critical activities are dependent upon specialist supplies,
the organization should identify the key suppliers and single sources of
supply. Strategies to manage continuity of supply may include:

24 • © BSI 2006

•

increasing the number of suppliers;

•

encouraging or requiring suppliers to have a validated business
continuity capability;

•

contractual and/or service level agreements with key suppliers; or

•

the identification of alternative, capable suppliers.

BS 25999-1:2006
7.8

Stakeholders

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

7.8.1 When determining appropriate BCM strategies, the organization
should consider and protect the interests of its key stakeholders. These
strategies should take into account relevant social and cultural
considerations.
7.8.2 The organization should identify appropriate strategies to
manage relationships with key stakeholders, business or service
partners and contractors. Each group might need particular
considerations. Strategies to protect the interests of key stakeholders
may include special arrangements for ensuring the welfare of
stakeholders with specific needs, such as disability, illness or
pregnancy.
7.8.3 The organization should identify a person or persons who will
discharge responsibility for welfare issues following an incident.

7.9

Civil emergencies
7.9.1 Organizations seeking to determine, implement or validate
strategies for incident management and business continuity
management should become familiar with official local responder
bodies at an early stage. These local responders are tasked with
anticipation, assessment, prevention, preparation, response and
recovery activities in relation to civil emergencies occurring within
their communities.
NOTE In the UK, these responder bodies may be known as local
resilience forums.

7.9.2 Key responders will be instrumental in officially declaring that a
civil emergency has occurred and in providing:
•

pre- or post-incident advice (e.g. risk assessments);

•

warning and informing procedures; and

•

community recovery arrangements following a civil emergency.

NOTE 1 Civil emergencies can result in death and physical injury; they
can have a profound and long term impact on the psychological, social,
and economic welfare of individuals and their communities. Emergencies
can quickly incur significant disruption to public transport services,
communication networks, critical infrastructures and the smooth flow of
goods, services and supplies. In light of this potential for disruption,
organizations may wish to familiarize themselves with the planning
arrangements of their respective local resilience forum.
NOTE 2 Under the UK Civil Contingencies Act (2004) [1], local
authorities are lawfully required to provide business continuity advice
and guidance to both commercial and voluntary organizations operating
within their jurisdiction.

7.10

Sign-off
Top management should sign off the documented strategies to confirm
that the determination of continuity strategies has been properly
undertaken and caters for likely causes and effects of disruption, and
that the chosen strategies are appropriate to meet the organization’s
objectives within the organization’s risk appetite.

8.1

Introduction
Clause 6 and Clause 7 set out how the organization should:
•

identify its critical activities;

•

evaluate threats to these critical activities;

•

choose appropriate strategies to reduce the likelihood and impacts
of incidents; and

•

choose appropriate strategies that provide for the continuity or
recovery of its critical activities.

The range of threats to be planned for should be determined by the
organization’s risk appetite.

8.2
COMMENTARY ON 8.2
In small organizations the
responsibility for incident and
business continuity management
may be vested in a single
individual. Larger organizations
may use a tiered approach and
may establish different teams to
focus on incident management,
business continuity and business
recovery issues. In some cases these
teams may be supported by other
teams with responsibility for
activities such as media
communications and people issues.

Incident response structure
8.2.1 The organization should define an incident response structure
that will enable an effective response and recovery from disruptions.
8.2.2 In any incident situation there should be a simple and
quickly-formed structure that will enable the organization to:
•

confirm the nature and extent of the incident,

•

take control of the situation,

•

contain the incident, and

•

communicate with stakeholders.

The same structure should trigger an appropriate business continuity
response. This structure may be referred to as the incident management
team (IMT) or crisis management team (CMT).

BS 25999-1:2006
8.2.3 The team should have plans, processes and procedures to
manage the incident and these should be supported by business
continuity tools to enable continuity and recovery of critical
activities.

Figure 2 illustrates the three main phases over time of an incident,
and the relationship between incident management and business
continuity.

coordination and communication of the incident response.

recovery of costs from insurers

NOTE In some cases an organization’s activation of its incident
management, business continuity and business recovery plans may be
enacted in rapid succession or simultaneously.

8.2.5 Organizations may develop specific plans to recover or resume
operations back to a “normal” state (recovery plans). However, in
some incidents it might not be possible to define what “normal” looks
like until some time after the incident, so that it might not be possible
to implement recovery plans immediately. Organizations might
therefore wish to ensure that business continuity plans are capable of
extended operation, giving time for the development of recovery
(“back-to-normal”) plans.

8.3.1
COMMENTARY ON 8.3.1
A small organization may have a
single plan that encompasses all
requirements for the business and
which covers its entire operations.
A very large organization may
have many plans, each of which
specifies in detail the recovery of:

Content of plans
Introduction
All plans, whether incident management plans, business continuity
plans or business recovery plans, should be concise and accessible to
those with responsibilities defined in the plans. Plans should contain the
elements in 8.3.2 to 8.3.6.

— a particular part of its business;
— particular premises; or
— a particular scenario,
and may include separate
documentation for the incident,
continuity and recovery phases.

8.3.2
COMMENTARY ON 8.3.2
Each plan may state clearly what it
does not intend to achieve and why.

Purpose and scope
The purpose and scope of each specific plan should be defined, agreed
by top management, and understood by those who will put the plan into
effect. Any relationship to other relevant plans or documents within the
organization should be clearly referenced and the method of obtaining
and accessing these plans described.
Each incident management, business continuity and business recovery
plan should set out prioritized objectives in terms of:

8.3.3
COMMENTARY ON 8.3.3
Plans may also contain, where
appropriate, procedures and
checklists that support the postincident review process.

28 • © BSI 2006

•

the critical activities to be recovered;

•

the timescales in which they are to be recovered;

•

the recovery levels needed for each critical activity; and

•

the situation in which each plan can be utilized.

Roles and responsibilities
The roles and responsibility of the people and teams having authority
(both in terms of decision-making and authority to spend) during and
following an incident should be clearly documented.
The persons or groups covered by a plan should be clearly defined.

8.3.4
COMMENTARY ON 8.3.4
Time lost during a response can
never be regained. It is almost
always better to mobilize the
response team and subsequently
stand it down than to miss an
opportunity to contain an incident
early and prevent escalation.
Organizations may factor in
defined and internationally agreed
escalation stages in line with clear
guidance from other expert
sources, e.g. the World Health
Organization for pandemics.

Plan invocation
The method by which an incident management, business continuity or
business recovery plan is invoked should be clearly documented. This
process should allow for the relevant plans or parts thereof to be
invoked in the shortest possible time following the occurrence of a
business disruption.
The organization should establish and document clear guidelines and a
set of criteria regarding which individual(s) have the authority to invoke
the plan(s) and under what circumstances.
The invocation process may require the immediate mobilization of
organizational resources. The plan should include a clear and precise
description of:
•

how to mobilize the team(s);

•

immediate rendezvous points; and

•

subsequent team meeting locations and details of any alternative
meeting locations (in larger organizations, these meeting places
may be referred to as incident management or command centres).

The organization should document a clear process for standing down
the team(s) once the incident is over, and returning to business as usual.

8.3.5

Document owner and maintainer
The organization should nominate the primary owner of the plan, and
identify and document who is responsible for reviewing, amending and
updating the plan at regular intervals.
A system of version control should be employed, and changes formally
notified to all interested parties with a formal plan distribution record
maintained and kept up-to-date.

8.3.6
COMMENTARY ON 8.3.6
The contact records may include
“out of hours” contact details.
However, where plans reference
such private details, respect for
data protection has to be a
paramount consideration.

8.4

Contact details
Each plan should contain or provide a reference to the essential contact
details for all key stakeholders.

The incident management plan (IMP)
The purpose of an IMP is to allow the organization to manage the initial
(acute) phase of an incident.
The IMP should:
a) be flexible, feasible, and relevant;
b) be easy to read and understand; and
c)

provide the basis for managing all possible issues, including the
stakeholder and external issues, facing the organization during an
incident.

© BSI 2006 •

29

BS 25999-1:2006
The IMP should also:
1) have top management support, including a board sponsor
where applicable; and
2) be supported by an appropriate budget for development,
maintenance and training.

8.5.1

Contents of the IMP
General
In addition to the content recommended in 8.3, an IMP should include
the information in 8.5.2 to 8.5.8.

8.5.2

Task and action lists
The IMP should include task lists and action checklists to manage the
immediate consequences of a business disruption. These tasks should:

8.5.3
COMMENTARY ON 8.5.3
Depending upon the scale of the
organization and the size of the
incident, a number of competent,
trained people may be required to
respond to telephone enquiries
about the incident.

8.5.4
COMMENTARY ON 8.5.4
Organizations have a direct
responsibility to safeguard the
welfare of employees, contractors,
visitors and customers where an
incident poses a direct risk to life,
livelihood and welfare. Special
attention will need to be paid to
any groups with disabilities or
other specific needs (e.g.
pregnancy, temporary disability
due to injury, etc.). Planning in
advance to meet these
requirements can reduce risk and
reassure those affected.
The long-term impacts of incidents
cannot be underestimated.
Developing appropriate strategies
in support of human welfare can
directly promote physical and
emotional recovery within the
organization.

30 • © BSI 2006

•

ensure that safety of individuals is addressed first;

•

be based upon the results of the organization’s BIA;

•

be structured in a way that delivers the strategic and tactical
options chosen by the organization (as described in Clause 7); and

•

help prevent the further loss or unavailability of critical activities,
and supporting resources as defined in Clause 7.

Emergency contacts
A description of how, and under what circumstances, the organization
will communicate with staff and their relatives, friends and emergency
contacts should be included. In some cases, it might be appropriate to
include detail in a separate document.
Next-of-kin and emergency contact information for all personnel should
be kept up-to-date and available for prompt use.

People activities
The IMP should satisfy the interests of those whose welfare might be put
at risk as a result of an incident, taking into account relevant social and
cultural considerations (see 7.8.2).
The IMP should identify the person(s), who will discharge responsibility
for welfare issues following an incident (see 7.8.3), including:
a) site evacuation (inclusive of internal “shelter-at-site” activities);
b) the mobilization of safety, first aid or evacuation-assistance teams;
c) locating and accounting for those who were on site or in the
immediate vicinity;
d) ongoing employee/customer communications and safety briefings.
The organization should deploy staff with appropriate levels of authority
to liaise where appropriate with the emergency services.
NOTE Emergency services play the primary role in protecting life and
relieving suffering during emergencies. Therefore, early liaison,
pre-planning and real-time incident coordination between the
organization and its first responders and the emergency services can
improve the efficiency of an incident response.

BS 25999-1:2006
The organization may retain a means to provide services to debrief and
counsel affected staff after an incident. Services may be sourced
externally or may be provided as an extension to existing occupational
health and employee assistance programmes.

8.5.5
COMMENTARY ON 8.5.5
Pre-prepared information can be
especially useful in the early stages
of an incident. It enables an
organization to provide details
about the organization and its
business while details of the
incident are still being established.
An organization may use all
applicable means to share
information during and after an
incident. Such sources may include
websites, spokespeople, news
sources, and generic company
briefing statements.

8.5.6
COMMENTARY ON 8.5.6
Pressure or community action
groups who collectively have power
or influence over the organization
might also need to be considered.

Media response
The organization’s media response should be documented in the IMP,
including:
a) the incident communications strategy;
b) the organization’s preferred interface with the media;
c)

a guideline or template for the drafting of a statement to be
provided to the media at the earliest practicable opportunity
following the incident;

d) appropriate numbers of trained, competent, spokespeople
nominated and authorized to release information to the media;
e)

establishment, where practicable, of a suitable venue to support
liaison with the media, or other stakeholder groups.

In some cases, it may be appropriate to:
•

provide supporting detail in a separate document;

•

establish an appropriate number of competent, trained people to
answer telephone enquiries from the press;

•

prepare background material about the organization and its
operations (this information should be pre-agreed for release);

•

ensure that all media information is made available without undue
delay.

Stakeholder management
A process for identifying and prioritizing communications with other
key stakeholders should be included. It may be necessary to develop a
separate stakeholder management plan to provide criteria for setting
priorities and allocating a person to each stakeholder or group of
stakeholders.

8.5.7
COMMENTARY ON 8.5.7
An incident management location
provides a known focal point from
which the incident can be
managed. It is important to
capture and share key information
and to set objectives, assign tasks,
manage resources, identify and
track issues, and make informed
decisions. Good communications
are essential. The use of a meeting
point overcomes the situations
where telephone networks are
overloaded.

Incident management location
The organization should define a robust and predetermined location,
room or space from which an incident will be managed. Once
established, this location should be the focal point for the organization’s
response. An alternative meeting point at a different location should
also be nominated in case access to the primary location is denied. Each
location should have access to appropriate resources by which the
incident team may initiate effective incident management activities
without delay.
The chosen location should be fit-for-purpose and include:
a) effective primary and secondary means of communication;
b) facilities for accessing and sharing information, including the
monitoring of the news media.

The location may be as simple as a
hotel room or a staff member’s
house. It may be as complex as a
dedicated “command centre” with
PCs, video-conferencing and
multiple telephones.
Initially, it might be necessary to
hold a virtual or off-site meeting,
e.g. via telephone, teleconference or
videoconference, so that key
decisions can be made promptly.

8.5.8

Annexes
The IMP should include up-to-date contact and mobilization details for
any relevant agencies, organizations and resources that might be
required to support the organization’s response strategies.
The IMP should include logs or forms for the recording of vital
information about the incident, such as the incident timeline, details of
casualties, decisions made, money spent, details of casualties, damage
assessments, communications issued, and all other information deemed
essential by the organization to support post incident review.
The IMP may also include or reference:
a) maps, charts, plans, photographs and other information that might
be relevant in the event of an incident;
b) documented response strategies agreed with third parties as
appropriate (joint venture partners, contractors, suppliers, etc.);
c) details of equipment storage and staging areas;
d) site access plans; and
e) a claims management procedure that ensures all insurance and
legal claims for or against the organization meet regulatory and
contractual requirements.

COMMENTARY ON 8.6
The components and contents of
BCPs vary from organization to
organization and have a different
level of detail based on the scale,
environment, culture and technical
complexity of the organization.

The business continuity plan(s) [BCP(s)]
The purpose of a business continuity plan (BCP) is to enable an
organization to recover or maintain its activities in the event of a
disruption to normal business operations.
BCPs are activated (invoked) to support the critical activities required
to deliver the organization's objectives. They may be invoked in whole
or part and at any stage of the response to an incident.

Large organizations might require
separate documents for each of
their critical activities, whereas
smaller organizations might be
able to cover everything that is
critical to them within a single
document.

8.7
8.7.1

Contents of the BCP
General
In addition to the items recommended in 8.3, a BCP should contain the
elements in 8.7.2 to 8.7.5.

8.7.2
COMMENTARY ON 8.7.2
These points are consistent with the
requirements of the Civil
Contingencies Act [1], Section 6.20.
Plans will reference the people,
premises, technology, information,
supplies and stakeholders
identified in the strategies phase
(see Clause 7). Clear assumptions
and details of any resources
required to implement plans ought
to be included. In the event that the
lack of a service or resource makes
the plan’s goals unachievable, a
clear procedure for escalating the
issue ought to be defined.

Action plans/ task lists
The action plan should include a structured checklist of actions and
tasks in an order of priority, highlighting:
a) how the BCP is invoked;
b) the person(s) responsible for invoking the business continuity
plan;
c)

the procedure that person should adopt in taking that decision;

d) the person(s) who should be consulted before such a decision is
taken;
e)

the person(s) who should be informed once a decision has been
taken;

f)

who goes where, and when;

g) what services are available where, and when; including how the
organization mobilizes external and third-party resources;
h) how and when this information is communicated; and
i)

if relevant, detailed procedures for manual workarounds, system
recovery, etc.

management of, and communication with, stakeholders.

Responsible person(s)
The organization should identify a nominated person(s) to manage the
business continuity and business recovery phases of a disruption.

Forms and annexes
Where appropriate, the BCP should contain up-to-date contact details
for relevant internal and external agencies, organizations and providers
that might be required to support the organization.
The business continuity plan should include an incident log or forms for
the recording of vital information, especially in respect of decisions
made.

9.1

Introduction
An organization’s business continuity and incident management
arrangements cannot be considered reliable until exercised and unless
their currency is maintained. Exercising is essential to developing
teamwork, competence, confidence and knowledge which is vital at the
time of an incident.
Arrangements should be verified through exercising, audit and
self-assessment processes to ensure that they are fit-for-purpose.

9.2
COMMENTARY ON 9.2
Exercises provide demonstrable
evidence of a business continuity
and incident management
competence and capability. Time
and resources spent proving BCM
strategies by exercising BCPs will
lead to a fit-for-purpose capability.
No matter how well designed and
thought-out a BCM strategy or BCP
appears to be, a series of robust
and realistic exercises will identify
areas that require amendment.

Exercise programme
An exercise programme should be consistent with the scope of the
business continuity plan(s), giving due regard to any relevant legislation
and regulation. Exercises may:
•

anticipate a predetermined outcome, e.g. are planned and scoped
in advance; or

•

allow the organization to develop innovative solutions.

An exercise programme should be devised that, over a period of time,
leads to objective assurance that the BCP will work as anticipated when
required. The programme should:
•

exercise the technical, logistical, administrative, procedural and
other operational systems of the BCP;

•

exercise the BCM arrangements and infrastructure (including
roles, responsibilities, and any incident management locations and
work areas, etc.);

•

validate the technology and telecommunications recovery,
including the availability and relocation of staff.

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

In addition, it might lead to the improvement of BCM capability by:

9.3

•

practising the organization’s ability to recover from an incident;

•

verifying that the BCP incorporates all organizational critical
activities and their dependencies and priorities;

•

highlighting assumptions which need to be questioned;

•

instilling confidence amongst exercise participants;

•

raising awareness of business continuity throughout the
organization by publicizing the exercise;

•

validating the effectiveness and timeliness of restoration of critical
activities; and

•

demonstrating competence of the primary response teams and
their alternatives.

Exercising BCM arrangements
9.3.1 Exercises should be realistic, carefully planned, and agreed with
stakeholders, so that there is minimum risk of disruption to business
processes. An exercise should be planned such that the risk of an
incident occurring as a direct result of the exercise is minimized.
9.3.2 Every exercise should have clearly defined aims and objectives. A
post-exercise debriefing and analysis should be undertaken which
considers the achievement of the aims and objectives of the exercise. A
post-exercise report should be produced that contains
recommendations and a timetable for their implementation.
9.3.3 The scale and complexity of exercises should be appropriate to
the organization’s recovery objectives.

COMMENTARY ON 9.3.4
Exercises that show serious
deficiencies or inaccuracies in the
BCP ought to be rerun after
corrective actions have been
completed.
A range of approaches to
exercising BCM strategies is shown
in Table 1.

9.3.4 Business continuity and incident management plans should be
exercised to ensure that they can be executed correctly, and contain
appropriate detail and instructions.

The frequency of exercises should depend upon both the organization’s needs, the environment in which it operates,
and stakeholder requirements. However, the exercising programme should be flexible, taking into account the rate of
change within the organization and the outcome of previous exercises. The above exercise methods can be employed
for individual plan components, and single and multiple plans.

9.3.5 The exercise programme should consider the roles of all parties,
including key third party providers, outsource partners and others who
would be expected to participate in recovery activities. An organization
may include such parties in its exercises.

9.4
COMMENTARY ON 9.4
The purpose of the BCM
maintenance process is to ensure
that the organization’s BCM
competence and capability
remains effective, fit-for purpose
and up-to-date.
Maintenance activities ought to
modify existing exercise schedules
when they indicate that there has
been a significant change in the
strategy, solution or business
process.

Maintaining BCM arrangements
A clearly defined and documented BCM maintenance programme
should be established. This programme should ensure that any changes
(internal or external) that impact the organization are reviewed in
relation to BCM. It should also identify any new products and services
and their dependent activities that need to be included in the BCM
maintenance programme.
As a result of the BCM maintenance programme, the organization
should:
•

review and challenge any assumptions made in any components of
BCM throughout the organization; and

•

distribute updated, amended or changed BCM policy, strategies,
solutions, processes and plans to key personnel under a formal
change control process.

NOTE If there are major business changes then a revision of the BIA
ought to be undertaken. The other components of the BCM programme may
be amended to take account of these changes.

The outcomes from the BCM maintenance process should include:
•

documented evidence of the proactive management and
governance of the organization’s business continuity programme;

•

verification that key people who are to implement the BCM
strategy and plans are trained and competent;

9.5

•

verification of the monitoring and control of the BCM risks faced
by the organization; and

•

documented evidence that material changes to the organization’s
structure, products and services, activities, purpose, staff and
objectives have been incorporated into the organization’s business
continuity and incident management plans.

Reviewing BCM arrangements
9.5.1 The organization’s top management should, at intervals that it
deems appropriate, review the organization’s BCM capability, to
ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. This
review should be documented.
9.5.2 The review should verify that compliance with the organization’s
BCM policy ensures compliance with any applicable laws, standards,
strategies, frameworks and good practice guidelines.

COMMENTARY ON 9.5.3
In the context of continual
improvement, the organization
may acquire knowledge on new
BCM-related technology and
practices, including new tools and
techniques, and these have to be
evaluated to establish their
potential benefit to the
organization.

9.5.3 The review should address the possible need for changes to
policy, strategy, objectives and other elements of the BCM
management system in the light of such things as exercise results,
changing circumstances and the commitment to continual
improvement.
9.5.4 The review can take the form of internal or external audits, or
self-assessments. The frequency and timing of reviews can be
influenced by laws and regulations, depending on the size, nature and
legal status of the organization. They might also be influenced by the
requirements of stakeholders.
An audit or self-assessment of the organization’s BCM programme
should verify that:

38 • © BSI 2006

•

all key products and services and their supporting critical activities
and resources have been identified and included in the
organization’s BCM strategy;

•

the organization’s BCM policy, strategies, framework and plans
accurately reflect its priorities and requirements (the
organization’s objectives);

•

the organization’s BCM competence and its BCM capability are
effective and fit-for-purpose and will permit management,
command, control and coordination of an incident;

•

the organization’s BCM solutions are effective, up-to-date and
fit-for-purpose, and appropriate to the level of risk faced by the
organization;

•

the organization’s BCM maintenance and exercising programmes
have been effectively implemented;

•

BCM strategies and plans incorporate improvements identified
during incidents and exercises and in the maintenance
programme;

•

the organization has an ongoing programme for BCM training and
awareness;

•

BCM procedures have been effectively communicated to relevant
staff, and that those staff understand their roles and
responsibilities; and

•

change control processes are in place and operate effectively.

BS 25999-1:2006
9.5.5

Audit

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

The organization should provide for the independent audit of its
BCM competence and capability to identify actual and potential
shortcomings. It should establish, implement and maintain procedures
for dealing with these. Independent audits should be conducted by
competent persons, whether internal or external.

9.5.6

Self-assessment
A BCM self-assessment process plays a role in ensuring that
an organization has a robust, effective and fit-for-purpose
BCM competence and capability. It provides the qualitative
verification of an organization’s ability to recover from an
incident. Self-assessment should be conducted against the
organization’s objectives. It should also take into account relevant
industry standards and good practice.

10.1

General

COMMENTARY ON 10.1
Creating and embedding a BCM
culture within an organization can
be a lengthy and difficult process
which might encounter a level of
resistance that was not
anticipated. An understanding of
the existing culture within the
organization will assist in the
development of an appropriate
BCM culture programme.

Building, promoting and embedding a BCM culture within an
organization ensures that it becomes part of the organization’s core
values and effective management.

All staff have to understand that
BCM is a serious issue for the
organization and that they have an
important role to play in
maintaining the delivery of
products and services to their
clients and customers.

10.2
COMMENTARY ON 10.2
Raising and maintaining
awareness of BCM with all the
organization’s staff is important to
ensure that they are aware of why
BCM is important to the
organization. They will need to be
shown that this is a lasting
initiative that has the ongoing
support of top management.

40 • © BSI 2006

An organization with a positive BCM culture will:
•

develop a BCM programme more efficiently;

•

instil confidence in its stakeholders (especially staff and
customers) in its ability to handle business disruptions;

•

increase its resilience over time by ensuring BCM implications are
considered in decisions at all levels; and

•

minimize the likelihood and impact of disruptions.

Development of a BCM culture is supported by:
•

leadership from senior personnel in the organization;

•

assignment of responsibilities (see 5.2);

•

awareness raising;

•

skills training; and

•

exercising plans.

Awareness
The organization should have a process for identifying and delivering
the BCM awareness requirements of the organization and evaluating the
effectiveness of its delivery.
BCM staff should make themselves aware of external BCM information.
This may be done in conjunction with seeking guidance from emergency
services, local authorities and regulators.

BS 25999-1:2006
The organization should raise, enhance and maintain awareness by
maintaining an ongoing BCM education and information programme for
all staff.

Licensed Copy: RATNAKUMAR PEDDINTI IDRBT 21/01/2009 09:51

Such a programme may include:
•

a consultation process with staff throughout the organization
concerning the implementation of the BCM programme;

•

discussion of BCM in the organization’s newsletters, briefings,
induction programme or journals;

•

inclusion of BCM on relevant web pages or intranets;

•

learning from internal and external incidents;

•

BCM as an item at team meetings;

•

exercising continuity plans at an alternative location (e.g. a
recovery site); and

•

visits to any designated alternative location (e.g. a recovery site).

The organization may extend its BCM awareness programme to its
suppliers and other stakeholders.

10.3

Skills training
The organization should have a process for identifying and delivering
the BCM training requirements of relevant participants and evaluating
the effectiveness of its delivery.
The organization should undertake training of:
a) BCM staff for tasks such as:
•

BCM programme management,

•

conducting a business impact analysis,

•

developing and implementing BCPs,

•

running a BCP exercise programme,

•

risk and threat assessment, and

•

media communications;

b) non-BCM staff requiring skills to undertake their nominated roles
in incident response or business recovery.
Response skills and competence throughout the organization should be
developed by practical training, including active participation in
exercises.

BS 25999-2:2007

Foreword
This British Standard was published by BSI and came into effect
on 20 November 2007. It was prepared by Panel BCM/1/-/2, under the
authority of Technical Committee BCM/1, Business continuity
management. A list of organizations represented on this committee
can be obtained on request to its secretary.
This British Standard has been developed by practitioners throughout
the business continuity community, drawing upon their academic,
technical and practical experiences of business continuity management
(BCM). It has been produced to define requirements for a management
systems approach to business continuity management based on good
practice for use in large, medium and small organizations operating in
industrial, commercial, public and voluntary sectors.
BS 25999, Business continuity management, is published in two
parts:
– Part 1: Code of practice;
– Part 2: Specification.
The requirements specified in this British Standard have been
developed with due regard for the principles and practices contained
within BS25999-1.
This British Standard provides a specification for use by internal and
external parties, including certification bodies, to assess the
organization’s ability to meet regulatory, customer, and the
organization’s own requirements.
This British Standard contains only those requirements that can be
objectively audited. Those organizations requiring more general
guidance on a broad range of business continuity management issues
are referred to BS 25999-1.
Demonstration of successful implementation of this British Standard
can therefore be used by an organization to assure interested parties
that an appropriate business continuity management system is in place.
In common with modern management system standards this standard
utilizes the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle for developing,
implementing, and improving the effectiveness of an organization’s
business continuity management system.
This publication does not purport to include all the necessary provisions
of a contract.
Users are responsible for its correct application.
Compliance with a British Standard cannot confer immunity
from legal obligations.

BS 25999-2:2007

Introduction
General
This British Standard specifies requirements for setting up and
managing an effective business continuity management system
(BCMS).
This emphasizes the importance of:
a) understanding business continuity needs and the necessity for
establishing policy and objectives for business continuity;
b) implementing and operating controls and measures for managing
an organization’s overall business continuity risks;
c)

monitoring and reviewing the performance and effectiveness of
the BCMS; and

d) continual improvement based on objective measurement.
A BCMS, like any other management system, has the following key
components:
a) a policy;
b) people with defined responsibilities;
c)

management processes relating to:
1) policy;
2) planning;
3) implementation and operation;
4) performance assessment;
5) management review; and
6) improvement;

d) a set of documentation providing auditable evidence; and
e)

topic specific processes relating to the subject, in this case
business continuity, such as business impact analysis (BIA) and
business continuity plan development.

The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle
The standard applies the “Plan-Do-Check-Act” (PDCA) cycle to
establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, exercising,
maintaining and improving the effectiveness of an organization’s BCMS.
This ensures a degree of consistency with other management systems
standards, such as BS EN ISO 9001:2000 (Quality Management
Systems), BS EN ISO 14001:2004 (Environmental
Management Systems), BS ISO/IEC 27001:2005 (Information
Security Management Systems) and BS ISO/IEC 20000:2005
(IT Service Management), thereby supporting consistent and
integrated implementation and operation with related management
systems (see Annex A).

Figure 1 illustrates how a BCMS takes as inputs the business continuity
requirements and expectations of the interested parties and, through
the necessary actions and processes, produces business continuity
outcomes (i.e. managed business continuity) that meet those
requirements and expectations.

A widely accepted approach that incorporates the PDCA cycle within
each activity is recommended in BS 25999-1 and summarized within
Figure 2. This iterative process ensures that business continuity is
established and continuously managed in an organization (for an
explanation of each element of the business continuity management
cycle, see BS 25999-1:2006, 3.7).

1 Scope
This British Standard specifies requirements for planning, establishing,
implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, exercising,
maintaining and improving a documented BCMS within the context of
managing an organization’s overall business risks.
The requirements specified in this British Standard are generic and
intended to be applicable to all organizations (or parts thereof),
regardless of type, size and nature of business. The extent of application
of these requirements depends on the organization’s operating
environment and complexity.
It is not the intent of this British Standard to imply uniformity in the
structure of a BCMS but for an organization to design a BCMS that is
appropriate to its needs and that meets its stakeholders’ requirements.
These needs are shaped by regulatory, customer and business
requirements, the products and services, the processes employed, the
size and structure of the organization and the requirements of its
stakeholders.
This British Standard can be used by internal and external parties,
including certification bodies, to assess an organization’s ability to meet
its own business continuity needs, as well as any customer, legal or
regulatory needs.

2 Terms and definitions
For the purposes of this part of BS 25999, the following definitions
apply.

2.1

activity

behalf) that produces or supports one or more products or services
NOTE Examples of such processes include accounts, call centre, IT,
manufacture, distribution.

2.2

audit

BS 25999-2:2007
2.4

business continuity management (BCM)
holistic management process that identifies potential threats to an
organization and the impacts to business operations that those threats,
if realized, might cause, and which provides a framework for building
organizational resilience with the capability for an effective response
that safeguards the interests of its key stakeholders, reputation, brand
and value-creating activities
NOTE Business continuity management involves managing the
recovery or continuation of business activities in the event of a business
disruption, and management of the overall programme through training,
exercises and reviews, to ensure the business continuity plan(s) stays
current and up-to-date.

aspects and phases of the business continuity management
programme
NOTE The business continuity management lifecycle is illustrated in
Figure 2.

2.6

2.7

for BCM policy and its implementation, those who implement and
maintain the BCMS, those who use or invoke the business continuity
and incident management plans, and those with authority during an
incident

business continuity management programme
ongoing management and governance process supported by top
management and appropriately resourced to ensure that the necessary
steps are taken to identify the impact of potential losses, maintain viable
recovery strategies and plans, and ensure continuity of products and
services through training, exercising, maintenance and review

2.8

business continuity management response
element of BCM concerned with the development and implementation
of appropriate plans and arrangements to ensure continuity of critical
activities, and the management of an incident

2.9

business continuity management system (BCMS)
that part of the overall management system that establishes,
implements, operates, monitors, reviews, maintains and improves
business continuity
NOTE The management system includes organizational structure,
policies, planning activities, responsibilities, procedures, processes and
resources.

2.10

business continuity plan (BCP)

NOTE 2 A consequence can be certain or uncertain and can have positive
or negative impact on objectives.

2.14

solution and compares this with the benefit delivered by that solution
NOTE The benefit may be defined in financial, reputational, service
delivery, regulatory or other terms appropriate to the organization.

2.15

critical activities
those activities which have to be performed in order to deliver the key
products and services which enable an organization to meet its most
important and time-sensitive objectives

unanticipated (e.g. a blackout or earthquake), which causes an
unplanned, negative deviation from the expected delivery of products or
services according to the organization’s objectives

2.17

exercise
activity in which the business continuity plan(s) is rehearsed in part or
in whole to ensure that the plan(s) contains the appropriate information
and produces the desired result when put into effect
NOTE An exercise can involve invoking business continuity procedures,
but is more likely to involve the simulation of a business continuity
incident, announced or unannounced, in which participants role-play in
order to assess what issues might arise, prior to a real invocation.

2.18

be put into effect in order to continue delivery of key products or
services

2.24

likelihood

(such as rare, unlikely, likely, almost certain), frequencies or
mathematical probabilities
NOTE 1 Likelihood can be expressed qualitatively or quantitatively.
NOTE 2 The word “probability” can be used instead of “likelihood” in
some non-English languages that have no direct equivalent. Because
“probability” is often interpreted more formally in English as a
mathematical term, “likelihood” is used throughout this Standard with the
intention that it is given the same broad interpretation as “probability”.

2.25

loss
negative consequence

2.26

management system
system to establish policy and objectives and to achieve those
objectives
[BS EN ISO 9000:2005]

2.30

process
set of interrelated or interacting activities which transforms inputs into
outputs
[BS EN ISO 9000:2005]

2.31

products and services
beneficial outcomes provided by an organization to its customers,
recipients and stakeholders, e.g. manufactured items, car insurance,
regulatory compliance and community nursing

2.32

recovery time objective
target time set for resumption of product, service or activity delivery
after an incident
NOTE The recovery time objective has to be less than the maximum
tolerable period of disruption.

2.33

resilience
ability of an organization to resist being affected by an incident

2.34

resources
all assets, people, skills, information, technology (including plant and
equipment), premises, and supplies and information (whether
electronic or not) that an organization has to have available to use, when
needed, in order to operate and meet its objectives

2.35

risk
something that might happen and its effect(s) on the achievement of
objectives
NOTE 1 The word “risk” is used colloquially in various ways, as a noun
(“a risk” or, in the plural, “risks”), a verb (to risk [something], or to put at
risk), or as an adjective (“risky”). Used as a noun the term “a risk” could
relate to either a potential event, its causes, the chance (likelihood) of
something happening, or the effects of such events. In risk management it
is important to make a clear distinction between these various usages of
the word “risk”.
NOTE 2 Risk is defined relative to a particular objective; therefore,
concern for several objectives implies the possibility of more than one
measure of risk with respect to any source of risk.
NOTE 3 Risk is often quantified as an average effect by summing the
combined effect of each possible consequence weighted by the associated
likelihood of each consequence, to obtain an “expected value”. However,
probability distributions are needed to quantify perceptions about the
range of possible consequences. Alternatively, summary statistics, such as
standard deviation, may be used in addition to expected value.

Introduction

0.1

Background and context

Cloud service providers who process Personally Identifiable Information (PII) under contract to their
customers have to operate their services in ways that allow both parties to meet the requirements of
applicable legislation and regulations covering the protection of PII. The requirements and the way in
which the requirements are divided between the cloud service provider and its customers vary according
to legal jurisdiction, and according to the terms of the contract between the cloud service provider
and the customer. Legislation which governs how PII is allowed to be processed (i.e. collected, used,
transferred and disposed of) is sometimes referred to as data protection legislation; PII is sometimes
referred to as personal data or personal information. The obligations falling on a PII processor vary
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, which makes it challenging for businesses providing cloud computing
services to operate multinationally.

A public cloud service provider is a ‘PII processor’ when it processes PII for and according to the instructions
of a cloud service customer. The cloud service customer, who has the contractual relationship with the
public cloud PII processor, can range from a natural person, a ‘PII principal’, processing his or her own
PII in the cloud, to an organization, a ‘PII controller’, processing PII relating to many PII principals. The
cloud service customer might authorize one or more cloud service users associated with it to use the
services made available to it under its contract with the public cloud PII processor. Note that the cloud
service customer has authority over the processing and use of the data. A cloud service customer who is
also a PII controller might be subject to a wider set of obligations governing the protection of PII than the
public cloud PII processor. Maintaining the distinction between PII controller and PII processor relies
on the public cloud PII processor having no data processing objectives other than those set by the cloud
service customer with respect to the PII it processes and the operations necessary to achieve the cloud
service customer’s objectives.
NOTE
Where the public cloud PII processor is processing cloud service customer account data, it might be
acting as a PII controller for this purpose. This International Standard does not cover such activity.

The intention of this International Standard, when used in conjunction with the information security
objectives and controls in ISO/IEC 27002, is to create a common set of security categories and controls
that can be implemented by a public cloud computing service provider acting as a PII processor. It has
the following objectives.
— To help the public cloud service provider to comply with applicable obligations when acting as a PII
processor, whether such obligations fall on the PII processor directly or through contract.

— To enable the public cloud PII processor to be transparent in relevant matters so that cloud service
customers can select well-governed cloud-based PII processing services.
— To assist the cloud service customer and the public cloud PII processor in entering into a contractual
agreement.

— To provide cloud service customers with a mechanism for exercising audit and compliance rights
and responsibilities in cases where individual cloud service customer audits of data hosted in a
multi-party, virtualized server (cloud) environment might be impractical technically and might
increase risks to those physical and logical network security controls in place.
This International Standard does not replace applicable legislation and regulations, but can assist by
providing a common compliance framework for public cloud service providers, in particular those that
operate in a multinational market.
0.2

PII protection controls for public cloud computing services

This International Standard is designed for organizations to use as a reference for selecting PII
protection controls within the process of implementing a cloud computing information security
management system based on ISO/IEC 27001, or as a guidance document for implementing commonly
accepted PII protection controls for organizations acting as public cloud PII processors. In particular,

ISO/IEC 27018:2014(E)
﻿
this International Standard has been based on ISO/IEC 27002, taking into consideration the specific
risk environment(s) arising from those PII protection requirements which might apply to public cloud
computing service providers acting as PII processors.

Typically an organization implementing ISO/IEC 27001 is protecting its own information assets.
However, in the context of PII protection requirements for a public cloud service provider acting as a
PII processor, the organization is protecting the information assets entrusted to it by its customers.
Implementation of the controls of ISO/IEC 27002 by the public cloud PII processor is both suitable
for this purpose and necessary. This International Standard augments the ISO/IEC 27002 controls to
accommodate the distributed nature of the risk and the existence of a contractual relationship between
the cloud service customer and the public cloud PII processor. This International Standard augments
ISO/IEC 27002 in two ways:
— implementation guidance applicable to public cloud PII protection is provided for certain of the
existing ISO/IEC 27002 controls, and

— Annex A provides a set of additional controls and associated guidance intended to address public
cloud PII protection requirements not addressed by the existing ISO/IEC 27002 control set.
Most of the controls and guidance in this International Standard will also apply to a PII controller.
However, the PII controller will, in most cases, be subject to additional obligations not specified here.
0.3

PII protection requirements

It is essential that an organization identifies its requirements for the protection of PII. There are three
main sources of requirement, as given below.
a)

Legal, Statutory, Regulatory and Contractual Requirements: One source is the legal, statutory,
regulatory and contractual requirements and obligations that an organization, its trading partners,
contractors and service providers have to satisfy, and their socio-cultural responsibilities and
operating environment. It should be noted that legislation, regulations and contractual commitments
made by the PII processor might mandate the selection of particular controls and might also
necessitate specific criteria for implementing those controls. These requirements can vary from
one jurisdiction to another.

b) Risks: Another source is derived from assessing risks to the organization associated with PII, taking
into account the organization’s overall business strategy and objectives. Through a risk assessment,
threats are identified, vulnerability to and likelihood of occurrence is evaluated and potential impact
is estimated. ISO/IEC 27005 provides information security risk management guidance, including
advice on risk assessment, risk acceptance, risk communication, risk monitoring and risk review.
ISO/IEC 29134 provides guidance on privacy impact assessment.
c)

0.4

Corporate policies: While many aspects covered by a corporate policy are derived from legal and
socio-cultural obligations, an organization might also choose voluntarily to go beyond the criteria
that are derived from the requirements of a).
Selecting and implementing controls in a cloud computing environment

Controls can be selected from this International Standard (which includes by reference the controls
from ISO/IEC 27002, creating a combined reference control set for the sector or application defined
by the scope). If required, controls can also be selected from other control sets, or new controls can be
designed to meet specific needs as appropriate.
NOTE
A PII processing service provided by a public cloud PII processor could be considered as an application
of cloud computing rather than as a sector in itself. Nevertheless, the term ‘sector-specific’ is used in this
International Standard, as this is the conventional term used within other standards in the ISO/IEC 27000 series.

The selection of controls is dependent upon organizational decisions based on the criteria for risk
acceptance, risk treatment options, and the general risk management approach applied to the organization
and, through contractual agreements, its customers and suppliers, and will also be subject to all relevant

ISO/IEC 27018:2014(E)
﻿
national and international legislation and regulations. Where controls from this International Standard
are not selected, this needs to be documented with justification for the omission.

Further, the selection and implementation of controls is dependent upon the public cloud provider’s
actual role in the context of the whole cloud computing reference architecture (see ISO/IEC 17789). Many
different organizations can be involved in providing infrastructure and application services in a cloud
computing environment. In some circumstances, selected controls can be unique to a particular service
category of the cloud computing reference architecture. In other instances, there can be shared roles
in implementing security controls. Contractual agreements need to clearly specify the PII protection
responsibilities of all organizations involved in providing or using the cloud services, including the
public cloud PII processor, its sub-contractors and the cloud service customer.
The controls in this International Standard can be considered as guiding principles and applicable for
most organizations. They are explained in more detail below along with implementation guidance.
Implementation can be made simpler if requirements for the protection of PII have been considered
in the design of the public cloud PII processor’s information system, services and operations. Such
consideration is an element of the concept that is often called “Privacy by Design”. The bibliography lists
relevant documents such as ISO/IEC 29101.
0.5

Developing additional guidelines

This International Standard can be regarded as a starting point for developing PII protection guidelines.
It is possible that not all of the controls and guidance in this code of practice will be applicable.
Furthermore, additional controls and guidelines not included in this International Standard might be
required. When documents are developed containing additional guidelines or controls, it might be
useful to include cross-references to clauses in this International Standard where applicable to facilitate
compliance checking by auditors and business partners.
0.6

Lifecycle considerations

PII has a natural lifecycle, from creation and origination through storage, processing, use and transmission
to its eventual destruction or decay. The risks to PII can vary during its lifetime but protection of PII
remains important to some extent at all stages.
PII protection requirements need to be taken into account as existing and new information systems are
managed through their lifecycle.

INTERNATIONAL STANDARD

ISO/IEC 27018:2014(E)

Information technology — Security techniques — Code
of practice for protection of personally identifiable
information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors
1 Scope
This International Standard establishes commonly accepted control objectives, controls and guidelines
for implementing measures to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in accordance with the
privacy principles in ISO/IEC 29100 for the public cloud computing environment.
In particular, this International Standard specifies guidelines based on ISO/IEC 27002, taking into
consideration the regulatory requirements for the protection of PII which might be applicable within
the context of the information security risk environment(s) of a provider of public cloud services.
This International Standard is applicable to all types and sizes of organizations, including public and
private companies, government entities and not-for-profit organizations, which provide information
processing services as PII processors via cloud computing under contract to other organizations.

The guidelines in this International Standard might also be relevant to organizations acting as PII
controllers; however, PII controllers might be subject to additional PII protection legislation, regulations
and obligations, not applying to PII processors. This International Standard is not intended to cover such
additional obligations.

public cloud service provider
party which makes cloud services available according to the public cloud model

4 Overview

4.1 Structure of this standard
This International Standard has a structure similar to that of ISO/IEC 27002. In cases where objectives
and controls specified in ISO/IEC 27002 are applicable without a need for any additional information,
only a reference is provided to ISO/IEC 27002. Additional controls and associated implementation
guidance applicable to PII protection for cloud computing service providers are described in Annex A
(normative).

In cases where controls need additional guidance applicable to PII protection for cloud computing
service providers, this is given under the heading Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance. In
some cases, further relevant information that enhances the additional guidance is provided under the
heading Other information for public cloud PII protection.

As shown in Table 1, such sector-specific guidance and information is included in the categories defined
in ISO/IEC 27002. Clause numbers, which have been aligned with the corresponding clause numbers in
ISO/IEC 27002, are as indicated in the table.

4.2 Control categories
In line with ISO/IEC 27002, each main control category contains:
a)

a control objective stating what is to be achieved; and

b) one or more controls that can be applied to achieve the control objective.
Control descriptions are structured as follows:
Control

Defines the specific control statement to satisfy the control objective.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

Provides more detailed information to support the implementation of the control and meeting the
control objectives. The guidance may not be entirely suitable or sufficient in all situations, and may
not fulfil the organization’s specific control requirements. Alternative or additional controls, or other
forms of risk treatment (avoiding, transferring or accepting risks), may therefore be appropriate.
Other information for public cloud PII protection

Provides further information that may need to be considered, such as legal considerations and
references to other standards.

5 Information security policies

5.1 Management direction for information security
The objective specified in ISO/IEC 27002:2013, 5.1 applies.
5.1.1

Policies for information security

Control 5.1.1 and the associated implementation guidance and other information specified in
ISO/IEC 27002 apply. The following sector-specific guidance also applies.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

The information security policies should be augmented by a statement concerning support for and
commitment to achieving compliance with applicable PII protection legislation and the contractual
terms agreed between the public cloud PII processor and its clients (cloud service customers).
Contractual agreements should clearly allocate responsibilities between the public cloud PII processor,
its sub-contractors and the cloud service customer, taking into account the type of cloud service in
question (e.g. a service of an IaaS, PaaS or SaaS category of the cloud computing reference architecture).
For example, the allocation of responsibility for application layer controls may differ depending on
whether the public cloud PII processor is providing a SaaS service or rather is providing a PaaS or IaaS
service upon which the cloud service customer can build or layer its own applications.
Other information for public cloud PII protection

In some jurisdictions the public cloud PII processor is directly subject to PII protection legislation.
Elsewhere, PII protection legislation applies to the PII controller only.

A mechanism to ensure the public cloud PII processor is obliged to support and manage compliance is
provided by the contract between the cloud service customer and the public cloud PII processor. The
contract could call for independently audited compliance, acceptable to the cloud service customer, e.g.
via the implementation of the relevant controls in this International Standard and in ISO/IEC 27002.

12.3.1 Information backup

Control 12.3.1 and the associated implementation guidance specified in ISO/IEC 27002 apply. The
following sector-specific guidance also applies.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

Information processing systems based on the cloud computing model introduce additional or
alternative mechanisms to off-site backups for protecting against loss of data, ensuring continuity of
data processing operations, and providing the ability to restore data processing operations after a
disruptive event. Multiple copies of data in physically and/or logically diverse locations (which may be
within the information processing system itself) should be created or maintained for the purposes of
backup and/or recovery.

PII-specific responsibilities in this respect may lie with the cloud service customer. Where the public
cloud PII processor explicitly provides backup and restore services to the cloud service customer, the
public cloud PII processor should provide clear information to the cloud service customer about the
capabilities of the cloud service with respect to backup and restoration of the cloud service customer
data.
NOTE 1
Individual jurisdictions may impose specific requirements regarding the frequency of backups.
Organizations operating in these jurisdictions should ensure that they comply with these requirements.

Procedures should be put in place to allow for restoration of data processing operations within a
specified, documented period after a disruptive event.

The back-up and recovery procedures should be reviewed at a specified, documented frequency.

NOTE 2
Individual jurisdictions may impose specific requirements regarding the frequency of reviews of
backup and recovery procedures. Organizations operating in these jurisdictions should ensure that they comply
with these requirements.

The use of sub-contractors to store replicated or backup copies of data being processed is covered by the
controls in this International Standard applying to sub-contracted PII processing. Where physical media
transfers take place this is also covered by controls in this International Standard.
The public cloud PII processor should have a policy which addresses the requirements for backup of
information and any further requirements (e.g. contractual and/or legal requirements) for the erasure
of PII contained in information held for backup purposes.

12.4 Logging and monitoring

The objective specified in ISO/IEC 27002:2013, 12.4 applies.
12.4.1 Event logging

Control 12.4.1 and the associated implementation guidance and other information specified in
ISO/IEC 27002 apply. The following sector-specific guidance also applies.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

A process should be put in place to review event logs with a specified, documented periodicity, to identify
irregularities and propose remediation efforts.
Where possible, event logs should record whether or not PII has been changed (added, modified or
deleted) as a result of an event and by whom. Where multiple service providers are involved in providing
service from different service categories of the cloud computing reference architecture, there may be
varied or shared roles in implementing this guidance.
The public cloud PII processor should define criteria regarding if, when and how log information can be
made available to or usable by the cloud service customer. These procedures should be made available
to the cloud service customer.

Where a cloud service customer is permitted to access log records controlled by the public cloud PII
processor, the public cloud PII processor should ensure that the cloud service customer can only access
records that relate to that cloud service customer’s activities, and cannot access any log records which
relate to the activities of other cloud service customers.
12.4.2 Protection of log information

Control 12.4.2 and the associated implementation guidance and other information specified in
ISO/IEC 27002 apply. The following sector-specific guidance also applies.
Public cloud PII protection specific implementation guidance

Log information recorded for purposes such as security monitoring and operational diagnostics may
contain PII. Measures, such as controlling access (see 9.2.3), should be put in place to ensure that logged
information is only used for its intended purposes.
A procedure, preferably automatic, should be put in place to ensure that logged information is deleted
within a specified and documented period.

18.2 Information security reviews

The objective specified in ISO/IEC 27002:2013, 18.2 applies.
18.2.1 Independent review of information security

Control 18.2.1 and the associated implementation guidance and other information specified in
ISO/IEC 27002 apply. The following sector-specific guidance also applies.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

In cases where individual cloud service customer audits are impractical or may increase risks to security
(see 0.1), the public cloud PII processor should make available to prospective cloud service customers,
prior to entering into, and for the duration of, a contract, independent evidence that information
security is implemented and operated in accordance with the public cloud PII processor’s policies and
procedures. A relevant independent audit as selected by the public cloud PII processor should normally
be an acceptable method for fulfilling the cloud service customer’s interest in reviewing the public cloud
PII processor’s processing operations, provided sufficient transparency is provided.
18.2.2 Compliance with security policies and standards

Control 18.2.2 and the associated implementation guidance and other information specified in
ISO/IEC 27002 apply.
18.2.3 Technical compliance review

Control 18.2.3 and the associated implementation guidance and other information specified in

Annex A
(normative)

Public cloud PII processor extended control set for PII protection
This annex specifies new controls and associated implementation guidance which, in combination with
the augmented controls and guidance in ISO/IEC 27002 (see Clauses 5 to 18), make up an extended
control set to meet the requirements for PII protection which apply to public cloud service providers
acting as PII processors.
These additional controls are classified according to the 11 privacy principles of ISO/IEC 29100. In many
cases the controls could be classified under more than one of the privacy principles. In such cases they
are classified under the most relevant principle.

A.1 Consent and choice

A.1.1 Obligation to co-operate regarding PII principals’ rights
Control
The public cloud PII processor should provide the cloud service customer with the means to enable them
to fulfil their obligation to facilitate the exercise of PII principals’ rights to access, correct and/or erase
PII pertaining to them.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

The PII controller’s obligations in this respect may be defined by law, by regulations or by contract.
These obligations may include matters where the cloud service customer uses the services of the public
cloud PII processor for implementation. For example, this could include the correction or deletion of PII
in a timely fashion.
Where the PII controller depends on the public cloud PII processor for information or technical measures
to facilitate the exercise of PII principals’ rights, the relevant information or technical measures should
be specified in the contract.

A.2 Purpose legitimacy and specification
A.2.1 Public cloud PII processor’s purpose
Control

PII to be processed under a contract should not be processed for any purpose independent of the
instructions of the cloud service customer.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

Instructions may be contained in the contract between the public cloud PII processor and the cloud
service customer including, e.g. the objective and time frame to be achieved by the service.

In order to achieve the cloud service customer’s purpose, there may be technical reasons why it is
appropriate for a public cloud PII processor to determine the method for processing PII, consistent
with the general instructions of the cloud service customer but without the cloud service customer’s
express instruction. For example, in order to efficiently utilize network or processing capacity it may
be necessary to allocate specific processing resources depending on certain characteristics of the PII
principal. In circumstances where the public cloud PII processor’s determination of the processing

ISO/IEC 27018:2014(E)
﻿
method involves the collection and use of PII, the public cloud PII processor should adhere to the relevant
privacy principles set forth in ISO/IEC 29100.

The public cloud PII processor should provide the cloud service customer with all relevant information,
in a timely fashion, to allow the cloud service customer to ensure the public cloud PII processor’s
compliance with purpose specification and limitation principles and ensure that no PII is processed
by the public cloud PII processor or any of its sub-contractors for further purposes independent of the
instructions of the cloud service customer.

A.2.2 Public cloud PII processor’s commercial use
Control

PII processed under a contract should not be used by the public cloud PII processor for the purposes of
marketing and advertising without express consent. Such consent should not be a condition of receiving
the service.
NOTE
This control is an addition to the more general control in A.2.1 and does not replace or otherwise
supersede it.

A.3 Collection limitation

No additional controls are relevant to this privacy principle.

A.4 Data minimization

A.4.1 Secure erasure of temporary files
Control
Temporary files and documents should be erased or destroyed within a specified, documented period.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

Implementation guidance on PII erasure is provided in A.10.11.

Information systems may create temporary files in the normal course of their operation. Such files
are specific to the system or application, but may include file system roll-back journals and temporary
files associated with the updating of databases and the operation of other application software.
Temporary files are not needed after the related information processing task has completed but there
are circumstances in which they may not be deleted. The length of time for which these files remain in
use is not always deterministic but a “garbage collection” procedure should identify the relevant files
and determine how long it has been since they were last used.
PII processing information systems should implement a periodic check that unused temporary files
above a specified age are deleted.

A.5 Use, retention and disclosure limitation
A.5.1 PII disclosure notification
Control

The contract between the public cloud PII processor and the cloud service customer should require
the public cloud PII processor to notify the cloud service customer, in accordance with any procedure
and time periods agreed in the contract, of any legally binding request for disclosure of PII by a law
enforcement authority, unless such a disclosure is otherwise prohibited.

Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance
The public cloud PII processor should provide contractual guarantees that it will reject any requests
for PII disclosure that are not legally binding, consult the corresponding cloud service customer where
legally permissible before making any PII disclosure and accept any contractually agreed requests for
PII disclosures that are authorized by the corresponding cloud service customer.

An example of a possible prohibition on disclosure would be a prohibition under criminal law to preserve
the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation.

A.5.2 Recording of PII disclosures
Control

Disclosures of PII to third parties should be recorded, including what PII has been disclosed, to whom
and at what time.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

PII may be disclosed during the course of normal operations. These disclosures should be recorded (see
12.4.1). Any additional disclosures to third parties, such as those arising from lawful investigations or
external audits, should also be recorded. The records should include the source of the disclosure and the
source of the authority to make the disclosure.

A.6 Accuracy and quality

No additional controls are relevant to this privacy principle.

A.7 Openness, transparency and notice

A.7.1 Disclosure of sub-contracted PII processing
Control
The use of sub-contractors by the public cloud PII processor to process PII should be disclosed to the
relevant cloud service customers before their use.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

Provisions for the use of sub-contractors to process PII should be transparent in the contract between
the public cloud PII processor and the cloud service customer. The contract should specify that subcontractors may only be commissioned on the basis of a consent that can generally be given by the cloud
service customer at the beginning of the service. The public cloud PII processor should inform the cloud
service customer in a timely fashion of any intended changes in this regard so that the cloud service
customer has the ability to object to such changes or to terminate the contract.

Information disclosed should cover the fact that sub-contracting is used and the names of relevant
sub-contractors, but not any business-specific details. The information disclosed should also include
the countries in which sub-contractors may process data (see A.11.1) and the means by which subcontractors are obliged to meet or exceed the obligations of the public cloud PII processor (see A.10.12).

Where public disclosure of sub-contractor information is assessed to increase security risk beyond
acceptable limits, disclosure should be made under a non-disclosure agreement and/or on the request
of the cloud service customer. The cloud service customer should be made aware that the information
is available.

A.8 Individual participation and access

No additional controls are relevant
to this privacy principle.

A.9 Accountability
A.9.1 Notification of a data breach involving PII
Control
The public cloud PII processor should promptly notify the relevant cloud service customer in the event
of any unauthorized access to PII or unauthorized access to processing equipment or facilities resulting
in loss, disclosure or alteration of PII.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

Provisions covering the notification of a data breach involving PII should form part of the contract
between the public cloud PII processor and the cloud service customer. The contract should specify how
the public cloud PII processor will provide the information necessary for the cloud service customer to
fulfil his obligation to notify relevant authorities. This notification obligation does not extend to a data
breach caused by the cloud service customer or PII principal or within system components for which
they are responsible. The contract should also define the maximum delay in notification of a data breach
involving PII.
In the event that a data breach involving PII has occurred, a record should be maintained with a
description of the incident, the time period, the consequences of the incident, the name of the reporter,
to whom the incident was reported, the steps taken to resolve the incident (including the person in
charge and the data recovered) and the fact that the incident resulted in loss, disclosure or alteration of
PII.

In the event that a data breach involving PII has occurred, the record should also include a description of
the data compromised, if known; and if notifications were performed, the steps taken to notify the cloud
service customer and/or regulatory agencies.

In some jurisdictions, relevant legislation or regulations may require the public cloud PII processor
to directly notify appropriate regulatory authorities (e.g. a PII protection authority) of a data breach
involving PII.
NOTE
There may be other breaches requiring notification that are not covered here, e.g. collection without
consent or other authorization, use for unauthorized purposes, etc.

A.9.2 Retention period for administrative security policies and guidelines
Control

Copies of security policies and operating procedures should be retained for a specified, documented
period upon replacement (including updating).
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

Review of current and historical policies and procedures may be required, e.g. in the cases of customer
dispute resolution and investigation by a PII protection authority. A minimum retention period of five
years is recommended in the absence of a specific legal or contractual requirement.

A.9.3 PII return, transfer and disposal
Control

The public cloud PII processor should have a policy in respect of the return, transfer and/or disposal of
PII and should make this policy available to the cloud service customer.

﻿
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance
At some point in time, PII may need to be disposed of in some manner. This may involve returning the PII
to the cloud service customer, transferring it to another public cloud PII processor or to a PII controller
(e.g. as a result of a merger), securely deleting or otherwise destroying it, anonymizing it or archiving it.
The public cloud PII processor should provide the information necessary to allow the cloud service
customer to ensure that PII processed under a contract is erased (by the public cloud PII processor
and any of its sub-contractors) from wherever they are stored, including for the purposes of backup
and business continuity, as soon as they are no longer necessary for the specific purposes of the cloud
service customer. The nature of the disposition mechanisms (de-linking, overwriting, demagnetization,
destruction or other forms of erasure) and/or the applicable commercial standards should be provided
for contractually.
The public cloud PII processor should develop and implement a policy in respect of the disposition of PII
and should make this policy available to cloud service customer.

The policy should cover the retention period for PII before its destruction after termination of a contract,
to protect the cloud service customer from losing PII through an accidental lapse of the contract.

NOTE
This control and guidance is also relevant under the retention element of the “Use, retention and
disclosure limitation” principle (see A.5).

A.10 Information security

A.10.1 Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements
Control
Individuals under the public cloud PII processor’s control with access to PII should be subject to a
confidentiality obligation.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

A confidentiality agreement, in whatever form, between the public cloud PII processor, its employees and
its agents should ensure that employees and agents do not disclose PII for purposes independent of the
instructions of the cloud service customer (see A.2.1). The obligations of the confidentiality agreement
should survive termination of any relevant contract.

A.10.2 Restriction of the creation of hardcopy material
Control

The creation of hardcopy material displaying PII should be restricted.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

Hardcopy material includes material created by printing.

A.10.3 Control and logging of data restoration
Control

There should be a procedure for, and a log of, data restoration efforts.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

NOTE
The above control makes generic the following requirement which applies in certain legal jurisdictions.
The log of data restoration efforts should contain: the person responsible, a description of the restored data, and
the data that were restored manually.

A.10.4 Protecting data on storage media leaving the premises
Control
PII on media leaving the organization’s premises should be subject to an authorization procedure
and should not be accessible to anyone other than authorized personnel (e.g. by encrypting the data
concerned).

A.10.5 Use of unencrypted portable storage media and devices
Control

Portable physical media and portable devices that do not permit encryption should not be used except
where it is unavoidable, and any use of such portable media and devices should be documented.

A.10.6 Encryption of PII transmitted over public data-transmission networks
Control

PII that is transmitted over public data-transmission networks should be encrypted prior to transmission.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

In some cases, e.g. the exchange of e-mail, the inherent characteristics of public data-transmission
network systems might require that some header or traffic data be exposed for effective transmission.

Where multiple service providers are involved in providing service from different service categories of
the cloud computing reference architecture, there may be varied or shared roles in implementing this
guidance.

A.10.7 Secure disposal of hardcopy materials
Control

Where hardcopy materials are destroyed, they should be destroyed securely using mechanisms such as
cross-cutting, shredding, incinerating, pulping, etc.

A.10.8 Unique use of user IDs
Control

If more than one individual has access to stored PII, then they should each have a distinct user ID for
identification, authentication and authorization purposes.

A.10.9 Records of authorized users
Control

An up-to-date record of the users or profiles of users who have authorized access to the information
system should be maintained.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

A user profile should be maintained for all users whose access is authorized by the public cloud PII
processor. The profile of a user comprises the set of data about that user, including user ID, necessary to
implement the technical controls providing authorized access to the information system.

A.10.10

User ID management

Control
De-activated or expired user IDs should
not be granted to other individuals.

﻿
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance
In the context of the whole cloud computing reference architecture, the cloud service customer may be
responsible for some or all aspects of user ID management for cloud service users under its control.

A.10.11

Contract measures

Control
Contracts between the cloud service customer and the public cloud PII processor should specify minimum
technical and organizational measures to ensure that the contracted security arrangements are in place
and that data are not processed for any purpose independent of the instructions of the controller. Such
measures should not be subject to unilateral reduction by the public cloud PII processor.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

Information security and PII protection obligations relevant to the public cloud PII processor may arise
directly from applicable law. Where this is not the case, PII protection obligations relevant to the public
cloud PII processor should be covered in the contract.

The controls in this International Standard, together with the controls in ISO/IEC 27002, are intended
as a reference catalogue of measures to assist in entering into an information processing contract in
respect of PII. The public cloud PII processor should inform a prospective cloud service customer, before
entering into a contract, about the aspects of its services material to the protection of PII.

The public cloud PII processor should be transparent about its capabilities during the process of entering
into a contract. However, it is ultimately the cloud service customer’s responsibility to ensure that the
measures implemented by the public cloud PII processor meet its obligations.

A.10.12

Sub-contracted PII processing

Control
Contracts between the public cloud PII processor and any sub-contractors that process PII should specify
minimum technical and organizational measures that meet the information security and PII protection
obligations of the public cloud PII processor. Such measures should not be subject to unilateral reduction
by the sub-contractor.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

The use of sub-contractors to store backup copies is covered by this control (see A.7.1).

A.10.13

Access to data on pre-used data storage space

Control
The public cloud PII processor should ensure that whenever data storage space is assigned to a cloud
service customer, any data previously residing on that storage space is not visible to that cloud service
customer.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

Upon deletion by a cloud service user of data held in an information system, performance issues may
mean that explicit erasure of those data is impractical. This creates the risk that another user may be
able to read the data. Such risk should be avoided by specific technical measures.
No specific guidance is especially appropriate for dealing with all cases in implementing this control.
However, as an example, some cloud infrastructure, platforms or applications will return zeroes if a
cloud service user attempts to read storage space which has not been overwritten by that user’s own
data.

A.11 Privacy compliance
A.11.1 Geographical location of PII
Control
The public cloud PII processor should specify and document the countries in which PII might possibly
be stored.
Public cloud PII protection implementation guidance

The identities of the countries where PII might possibly be stored should be made available to cloud
service customers. The identities of the countries arising from the use of sub-contracted PII processing
should be included. Where specific contractual agreements apply to the international transfer of data,
such as Model Contract Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules or Cross Border Privacy Rules, the agreements
and the countries or circumstances in which such agreements apply should also be identified. The public
cloud PII processor should inform the cloud service customer in a timely fashion of any intended changes
in this regard so that the cloud service customer has the ability to object to such changes or to terminate
the contract.

A.11.2 Intended destination of PII
Control

PII transmitted using a data-transmission network should be subject to appropriate controls designed
to ensure that data reaches its intended destination.

Foreword
ISO (the International Organisation for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organisation to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organisations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27000 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,

0.1

Overview

International Standards for management systems provide a model to follow in setting up and operating a
management system. This model incorporates the features on which experts in the field have reached a
consensus as being the international state of the art. ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 maintains an expert committee
dedicated to the development of international management systems standards for information security,
otherwise known as the Information Security Management System (ISMS) family of standards.
Through the use of the ISMS family of standards, organisations can develop and implement a framework for
managing the security of their information assets including financial information, intellectual property, and
employee details, or information entrusted to them by customers or third parties. These standards can also be
used to prepare for an independent assessment of their ISMS applied to the protection of information.

1

Scope

This International Standard describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management
systems, which form the subject of the ISMS family of standards, and defines related terms and definitions.
This International Standard is applicable to all types and sizes of organisation (e.g. commercial enterprises,
government agencies, not-for-profit organisations).

Information security management systems
Introduction

Organisations of all types and sizes:
a)

collect, process, store, and transmit information;

b)

recognise that information, and related processes, systems, networks and people are important assets for
achieving organisation objectives;

c)

face a range of risks that may affect the functioning of assets; and

d)

address their perceived risk exposure by implementing information security controls.

All information held and processed by an organisation is subject to threats of attack, error, nature (for
example, flood or fire), etc, and is subject to vulnerabilities inherent in its use. The term information security is
generally based on information being considered as an asset which has a value requiring appropriate
protection, for example, against the loss of availability, confidentiality and integrity. Enabling accurate and
complete information to be available in a timely manner to those with an authorized need is a catalyst for
business efficiency.
Protecting information assets through defining, achieving, maintaining, and improving information security
effectively is essential to enable an organisation to achieve its objectives, and maintain and enhance its legal
compliance and image. These coordinated activities directing the implementation of suitable controls and
treating unacceptable information security risks are generally known as elements of information security
management.
As information security risks and the effectiveness of controls change depending on shifting circumstances,
organisations need to:
a)

monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented controls and procedures;

© ISO/IEC 2012 – All rights reserved

11

ISO/IEC 27000:2012(E)

b)

identify emerging risks to be treated; and

c)

select, implement and improve appropriate controls as needed.

To interrelate and coordinate such information security activities, each organisation needs to establish its
policy and objectives for information security and achieve those objectives effectively by using a management
system.

3.2

What is an ISMS?

3.2.1

Overview and principles

An Information Security Management System (ISMS) consists of the policies, procedures, guidelines, and
associated resources and activities, collectively managed by an organisation, in the pursuit of protecting its
information assets. An ISMS is a systematic approach for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring,
reviewing, maintaining and improving organisation’s information security to achieve business objectives. It is
based upon a risk assessment and the organisation's risk acceptance levels designed to effectively treat and
manage risks. Analysing requirements for the protection of information assets and applying appropriate
controls to ensure the protection of these information assets, as required, contributes to the successful
implementation of an ISMS. The following fundamental principles also contribute to the successful
implementation of an ISMS:
a)

awareness of the need for information security;

b)

assignment of responsibility for information security;

c)

incorporating management commitment and the interests of stakeholders;

d)

enhancing societal values;

e)

risk assessments determining appropriate controls to reach acceptable levels of risk;

f)

security incorporated as an essential element of information networks and systems;

g)

active prevention and detection of information security incidents;

h)

ensuring a comprehensive approach to information security management; and

i)

continual reassessment of information security and making of modifications as appropriate.

3.2.2

Information

Information is an asset that, like other important business assets, is essential to an organisation's business
and consequently needs to be suitably protected. Information can be stored in many forms, including: digital
form (e.g. data files stored on electronic or optical media), material form (e.g. on paper), as well as
unrepresented information in the form of knowledge of the employees. Information may be transmitted by
various means including: courier, electronic or verbal communication. Whatever form information takes, or the
means by which the information is transmitted, it always needs appropriate protection.
In many organisations information is dependent upon information and communications technology. This
technology is often an essential element in the organisation and assists in facilitating the creation, processing,
storing, transmitting, protection and destruction of information.
3.2.3

Information security

Information security includes three main dimensions: confidentiality, availability and integrity. Information
security involves the application and management of appropriate security measures that involves

12

© ISO/IEC 2012 – All rights reserved

ISO/IEC 27000:2012(E)

consideration of a wide range of threats, with the aim of ensuring sustained business success and continuity,
and minimising impacts of information security incidents.
Information security is achieved through the implementation of an applicable set of controls, selected through
the chosen risk management process and managed using an ISMS, including policies, processes,
procedures, organisational structures, software and hardware to protect the identified information assets.
These controls need to be specified, implemented, monitored, reviewed and improved where necessary, to
ensure that the specific information security and business objectives of the organisation are met. Relevant
information security controls are expected to be seamlessly integrated with an organisation's business
processes.
3.2.4

Management

Management involves activities to direct, control and continually improve the organisation within appropriate
structures. Management activities include the act, manner, or practice of organizing, handling, directing,
supervising, and controlling resources. Management structures extend from one person in a small
organisation to management hierarchies consisting of many individuals in large organisations.
In terms of an ISMS, management involves the supervision and making of decisions necessary to achieve
business objectives through the protection of the organisation's information assets. Management of
information security is expressed through the formulation and use of information security policies, procedures
and guidelines, which are then applied throughout the organisation by all individuals associated with the
organisation.
NOTE
The term “management” may sometimes refer to people (i.e. a person or group of people with authority and
responsibility for the conduct and control of an organisation). The term “management” addressed in this clause is not in
this sense.

3.2.5

Management system

A management system uses a framework of resources to achieve an organisation's objectives. The
management system includes organisational structure, policies, planning activities, responsibilities, practices,
procedures, processes and resources.
In terms of information security, a management system allows an organisation to:
a)

satisfy the information security requirements of customers and other stakeholders;

b)

improve an organisation's plans and activities;

c)

meet the organisation's information security objectives;

d)

comply with regulations, legislation and industry mandates; and

e)

manage information assets in an organized way that facilitates continual improvement and adjustment to
current organisational goals.

3.3

Process approach

Organisations need to identify and manage many activities in order to function effectively and efficiently. Any
activity using resources needs to be managed to enable the transformation of inputs into outputs using a set
of interrelated or interacting activities – this is also known as a process. The output from one process can
directly form the input to another process and generally this transformation is carried out under planned and
controlled conditions. The application of a system of processes within an organisation, together with the
identification and interactions of these processes, and their management, can be referred to as a “process
approach”.

© ISO/IEC 2012 – All rights reserved

13

ISO/IEC 27000:2012(E)

The process approach for the ISMS presented in the ISMS family of standards is based on the operating
principle adopted in ISO's management system standards commonly known as the Plan – Do – Check – Act
(PDCA) process.
a)

Plan – establish objectives and make plans (analyze the organisation's situation, establish the overall
objectives and set targets, and develop plans to achieve them);

b)

Do – implement plans (do what was planned to do);

c)

Check – measure results (measure/monitor the extent to which achievements meet planned objectives);
and

d)

Act – correct and improve activities (learn from mistakes to improve activities to achieve better results).

3.4

Why an ISMS is important

Risks associated with an organisation's information assets need to be addressed. Achieving information
security requires the management of risk, and encompasses risks from physical, human and technology
related threats associated with all forms of information within or used by the organisation.
The adoption of an ISMS is expected to be a strategic decision for an organisation and it is necessary that this
decision is seamlessly integrated, scaled and updated in accordance with the needs of the organisation.
The design and implementation of an organisation's ISMS is influenced by the needs and objectives of the
organisation, security requirements, the business processes employed and the size and structure of the
organisation. The design and operation of an ISMS needs to reflect the interests and information security
requirements of all of the organisation's stakeholders including customers, suppliers, business partners,
shareholders and other relevant third parties.
In an interconnected world, information and related processes, systems, and networks constitute critical
business assets. Organisations and their information systems and networks face security threats from a wide
range of sources, including computer-assisted fraud, espionage, sabotage, vandalism, fire and flood. Damage
to information systems and networks caused by malicious code, computer hacking, and denial of service
attacks have become more common, more ambitious, and increasingly sophisticated.
An ISMS is important to both public and private sector businesses. In any industry, an ISMS is an enabler that
supports e-business and is essential for risk management activities. The interconnection of public and private
networks and the sharing of information assets increases the difficulty of controlling access to and handling of
information. In addition, the distribution of mobile storage devices containing information assets can weaken
the effectiveness of traditional controls. When organisations adopt the ISMS family of standards the ability to
apply consistent and mutually-recognisable information security principles can be demonstrated to business
partners and other interested parties.
Information security is not always taken into account in the design and development of information systems.
Further, information security is often thought of as being a technical solution. However, the information
security that can be achieved through technical means is limited, and may be ineffective without being
supported by appropriate management and procedures within the context of an ISMS. Integrating security into
an information system after the fact could be cumbersome and costly. An ISMS involves identifying which
controls are in place and requires careful planning and attention to detail. As an example, access controls,
which may be technical (logical), physical, administrative (managerial) or a combination, provide a means to
ensure that access to information assets is authorized and restricted based on the business and information
security requirements.
The successful adoption of an ISMS is important to protect information assets allowing an organisation to:
a)

achieve greater assurance that its information assets are adequately protected against threats on a
continual basis;

ISO/IEC 27000:2012(E)

b)

maintain a structured and comprehensive framework for identifying and assessing information security
risks, selecting and applying applicable controls, and measuring and improving their effectiveness;

c)

continually improve its control environment; and

d)

effectively achieve legal and regulatory compliance.

3.5

Establishing, monitoring, maintaining and improving an ISMS

3.5.1

Overview

An organisation needs to undertake the following steps in establishing, monitoring, maintaining and improving
its ISMS:
a)

identify information assets and their associated information security requirements (see 3.5.2);

b)

assess information security risks (see 3.5.3) and treat information security risks (see 3.5.4);

c)

select and implement relevant controls to manage unacceptable risks (see 3.5.5); and

d)

monitor, maintain and improve the effectiveness of controls associated with the organisation's information
assets (see 3.5.6).

To ensure the ISMS is effectively protecting the organisation's information assets on an ongoing basis, it is
necessary for steps (a) – (d) to be continuously repeated to identify changes in risks or in the organisation's
strategies or business objectives.
3.5.2

Identifying information security requirements

Within the overall strategy and business objectives of the organisation, its size and geographical spread,
information security requirements can be identified through an understanding of:
a)

identified information assets and their value;

b)

business needs for information processing, storage and communication; and

c)

legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements.

Conducting a methodical assessment of the risks associated with the organisation's information assets will
involve analyzing: threats to information assets; vulnerabilities to and the likelihood of a threat materializing to
information assets; and the potential impact of any information security incident on information assets. The
expenditure on relevant controls is expected to be proportionate to the perceived business impact of the risk
materialising.
3.5.3

Assessing information security risks

Managing information security risks requires a suitable risk assessment and risk treatment method which may
include an estimation of the costs and benefits, legal requirements, the concerns of stakeholders, and other
inputs and variables as appropriate.
Risk assessments should identify, quantify, and prioritize risks against criteria for risk acceptance and
objectives relevant to the organisation. The results should guide and determine the appropriate management
action and priorities for managing information security risks and for implementing controls selected to protect
against these risks.
Risk assessment should include the systematic approach of estimating the magnitude of risks (risk analysis)
and the process of comparing the estimated risks against risk criteria to determine the significance of the risks
(risk evaluation).

© ISO/IEC 2012 – All rights reserved

15

ISO/IEC 27000:2012(E)

Risk assessments should be performed periodically to address changes in the information security
requirements and in the risk situation, e.g. in the assets, threats, vulnerabilities, impacts, the risk evaluation,
and when significant changes occur. These risk assessments should be undertaken in a methodical manner
capable of producing comparable and reproducible results.
The information security risk assessment should have a clearly defined scope in order to be effective and
should include relationships with risk assessments in other areas, if appropriate.
ISO/IEC 27005 provides information security risk management guidance, including advice on risk
assessment, risk treatment, risk acceptance, risk reporting, risk monitoring and risk review. Examples of risk
assessment methodologies are included as well.
3.5.4

Treating information security risks

Before considering the treatment of a risk, the organisation should decide criteria for determining whether or
not risks can be accepted. Risks may be accepted if, for example, it is assessed that the risk is low or that the
cost of treatment is not cost-effective for the organisation. Such decisions should be recorded.
For each of the risks identified following the risk assessment a risk treatment decision needs to be made.
Possible options for risk treatment include:
a)

applying appropriate controls to reduce the risks;

b)

knowingly and objectively accepting risks, providing they clearly satisfy the organisation’s policy and
criteria for risk acceptance;

c)

avoiding risks by not allowing actions that would cause the risks to occur;

d)

sharing the associated risks to other parties, e.g. insurers or suppliers.

For those risks where the risk treatment decision has been to apply appropriate controls, these controls
should be selected and implemented.
3.5.5

Selecting and implementing controls

Once information security requirements have been identified (see 3.5.2), information security risks to the
identified information assets have been determined and assessed (see 3.5.3) and decisions for the treatment
of information security risks having been made (see 3.5.4), then selection and implementation of controls
apply for risk reduction.
Controls should ensure that risks are reduced to an acceptable level taking into account:
a)

requirements and constraints of national and international legislation and regulations;

b)

organisational objectives;

c)

operational requirements and constraints;

d)

cost of implementation and operation in relation to the risks being reduced, and remaining proportional to
the organisation’s requirements and constraints;

e)

the need to balance the investment in implementation and operation of controls against the loss likely to
result from information security incidents.

The controls specified in ISO/IEC 27002:2005 are acknowledged as best practices applicable to most
organisations and readily tailored to accommodate organisations of various sizes and complexities. Other
standards in the ISMS family of standards provide guidance on the selection and application of
ISO/IEC 27002 controls for the information security management system.
Information security controls should be considered at the systems and projects requirements specification and
design stage. Failure to do so can result in additional costs and less effective solutions, and maybe, in the
worst case, inability to achieve adequate security. Controls can be selected from ISO/IEC 27002 or from other
control sets, or new controls can be designed to meet the specific needs of the organisation. It is necessary to
recognize that some controls may not be applicable to every information system or environment, and might
not be practicable for all organisations.

16

© ISO/IEC 2012 – All rights reserved

ISO/IEC 27000:2012(E)

It should be kept in mind that no set of controls can achieve complete information security. Additional
management actions should be implemented to monitor, evaluate and improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of information security controls to support the organisation’s aims.
The selection and implementation of controls should be documented within a statement of applicability to
assist with compliance requirements.
3.5.6

Monitor, maintain and improve the effectiveness of the ISMS

An organisation needs to maintain and improve the ISMS through monitoring and assessing performance
against organisational policies and objectives, and reporting the results to management for review. This ISMS
review will check that the ISMS includes specified controls that are suitable to treat risks within the ISMS
scope. Furthermore, based on the records of these monitored areas, it will provide evidence of verification,
and traceability of corrective, preventive and improvement actions.

3.6

ISMS critical success factors

A large number of factors are critical to the successful implementation of an ISMS to allow an organisation to
meet its business objectives. Examples of critical success factors include:
a)

information security policy, objectives, and activities aligned with objectives;

b)

an approach and framework for designing, implementing, monitoring, maintaining, and improving
information security consistent with the organisational culture;

c)

visible support and commitment from all levels of management, especially top management;

d)

an understanding of information asset protection requirements achieved through the application of
information security risk management (see ISO/IEC 27005);

e)

an effective information security awareness, training and education programme, informing all employees
and other relevant parties of their information security obligations set forth in the information security
policies, standards etc., and motivating them to act accordingly;

f)

an effective information security incident management process;

g)

an effective business continuity management approach; and

h)

a measurement system used to evaluate performance in information security management and feedback
suggestions for improvement.

An ISMS increases the likelihood that an organisation will consistently achieve the critical success factors
required to protect its information assets.

3.7

Benefits of the ISMS family of standards

The benefits of implementing an ISMS will primarily result from a reduction in information security risks (i.e.
reducing the probability of, and/or impact caused by, information security incidents). Specifically, benefits
realised for an organisation to achieve sustainable success from the adoption of the ISMS family of standards
include:
a)

a structured manner supporting the process of specifying, implementing, operating and maintaining a
comprehensive, cost-effective, value creating, integrated and aligned ISMS that meets the organisation's
needs across different operations and sites;

b)

assistance for management in consistently managing and operating in a responsible manner their
approach towards information security management, within the context of corporate risk management
and governance, including educating and training business and system owners on the holistic
management of information security;

© ISO/IEC 2012 – All rights reserved

17

ISO/IEC 27000:2012(E)

c)

promotion of globally-accepted good information security practices in a non-prescriptive manner, giving
organisations the latitude to adopt and improve relevant controls that suit their specific circumstances and
to maintain them in the face of internal and external changes;

d)

provision of a common language and conceptual basis for information security, making it easier to place
confidence in business partners with a compliant ISMS, especially if they require certification against
ISO/IEC 27001 by an accredited certification body;

e)

increase in stakeholder trust in the organisation;

f)

satisfying societal needs and expectations; and

g)

more effective economic management of information security investments.

ISMS family of standards

4.1

General information

The ISMS family of standards consists of inter-related standards, already published or under development,
and contains a number of significant structural components. These components are focused upon normative
standards describing ISMS requirements (ISO/IEC 27001) and certification body requirements
(ISO/IEC 27006) for those certifying conformity with ISO/IEC 27001. Other standards provide guidance for
various aspects of an ISMS implementation, addressing a generic process, control-related guidelines as well
as sector-specific guidance. Relationships between the ISMS family of standards 2) are illustrated in Figure 1.

Annex A
(informative)
Verbal forms for the expression of provisions

Each of the ISMS family of standards documents do not in themselves impose an obligation upon anyone to
follow them. However, such an obligation may be imposed, for example, by legislation or by a contract. In
order to be able to claim conformity with a document, the user needs to be able to identify the requirements
required to be satisfied. The user also needs to be able to distinguish these requirements from other
recommendations where there is a certain freedom of choice.
The following table clarifies how an ISMS family of standards document is to be interpreted in terms of its
verbal expressions as being either requirements or recommendations.
The table is based on the provisions of JTC1 Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of
International Standards, Annex H

INDICATION

EXPLANATION

Requirement

the terms “shall” and “shall not” indicate requirements strictly to be followed in order
to conform to the document and from which no deviation is permitted

Recommendation

the terms “should” and “should not” indicate that among several possibilities one is
recommended as particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or
that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that (in the
negative form) a certain possibility or course of action is deprecated but not
prohibited

Permission

the term “may” and “need not” indicates a course of action permissible within the
limits of the document

Possibility

the term “can” and “cannot” indicates a possibility of something occurring

Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27001 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.

Introduction

0.1 General
This International Standard has been prepared to provide a model for establishing, implementing, operating,
monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). The
adoption of an ISMS should be a strategic decision for an organization. The design and implementation of an
organization’s ISMS is influenced by their needs and objectives, security requirements, the processes
employed and the size and structure of the organization. These and their supporting systems are expected to
change over time. It is expected that an ISMS implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of
the organization, e.g. a simple situation requires a simple ISMS solution.
This International Standard can be used in order to assess conformance by interested internal and external
parties.

0.2 Process approach
This International Standard adopts a process approach for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring,
reviewing, maintaining and improving an organization's ISMS.
An organization needs to identify and manage many activities in order to function effectively. Any activity using
resources and managed in order to enable the transformation of inputs into outputs can be considered to be a
process. Often the output from one process directly forms the input to the next process.
The application of a system of processes within an organization, together with the identification and
interactions of these processes, and their management, can be referred to as a “process approach”.
The process approach for information security management presented in this International Standard
encourages its users to emphasize the importance of:
a) understanding an organization’s information security requirements and the need to establish policy and
objectives for information security;
b) implementing and operating controls to manage an organization's information security risks in the context
of the organization’s overall business risks;
c) monitoring and reviewing the performance and effectiveness of the ISMS; and
d) continual improvement based on objective measurement.
This International Standard adopts the "Plan-Do-Check-Act" (PDCA) model, which is applied to structure all
ISMS processes. Figure 1 illustrates how an ISMS takes as input the information security requirements and
expectations of the interested parties and through the necessary actions and processes produces information
security outcomes that meets those requirements and expectations. Figure 1 also illustrates the links in the
processes presented in Clauses 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.
The adoption of the PDCA model will also reflect the principles as set out in the OECD Guidelines (2002)1)
governing the security of information systems and networks. This International Standard provides a robust
model for implementing the principles in those guidelines governing risk assessment, security design and
implementation, security management and reassessment.

EXAMPLE 1
A requirement might be that breaches of information security will not cause serious financial damage to an
organization and/or cause embarrassment to the organization.
EXAMPLE 2
An expectation might be that if a serious incident occurs — perhaps hacking of an organization’s eBusiness
web site — there should be people with sufficient training in appropriate procedures to minimize the impact.

0.3 Compatibility with other management systems
This International Standard is aligned with ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001:2004 in order to support consistent
and integrated implementation and operation with related management standards. One suitably designed
management system can thus satisfy the requirements of all these standards. Table C.1 illustrates the
relationship between the clauses of this International Standard, ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001:2004.
This International Standard is designed to enable an organization to align or integrate its ISMS with related
management system requirements.

Scope

1.1 General
This International Standard covers all types of organizations (e.g. commercial enterprises, government
agencies, non-profit organizations). This International Standard specifies the requirements for establishing,
implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving a documented ISMS within the
context of the organization’s overall business risks. It specifies requirements for the implementation of security
controls customized to the needs of individual organizations or parts thereof.
The ISMS is designed to ensure the selection of adequate and proportionate security controls that protect
information assets and give confidence to interested parties.
NOTE 1: References to ‘business’ in this International Standard should be interpreted broadly to mean those activities
that are core to the purposes for the organization’s existence.
NOTE 2:

ISO/IEC 17799 provides implementation guidance that can be used when designing controls.

1.2 Application
The requirements set out in this International Standard are generic and are intended to be applicable to all
organizations, regardless of type, size and nature. Excluding any of the requirements specified in Clauses 4,
5, 6, 7, and 8 is not acceptable when an organization claims conformity to this International Standard.
Any exclusion of controls found to be necessary to satisfy the risk acceptance criteria needs to be justified and
evidence needs to be provided that the associated risks have been accepted by accountable persons. Where
any controls are excluded, claims of conformity to this International Standard are not acceptable unless such
exclusions do not affect the organization’s ability, and/or responsibility, to provide information security that
meets the security requirements determined by risk assessment and applicable legal or regulatory
requirements.
NOTE:
If an organization already has an operative business process management system (e.g. in relation with
ISO 9001 or ISO 14001), it is preferable in most cases to satisfy the requirements of this International Standard within this
existing management system.

The organization shall do the following.
a) Define the scope and boundaries of the ISMS in terms of the characteristics of the business, the
organization, its location, assets and technology, and including details of and justification for any
exclusions from the scope (see 1.2).
b) Define an ISMS policy in terms of the characteristics of the business, the organization, its location, assets
and technology that:
1)

includes a framework for setting objectives and establishes an overall sense of direction and
principles for action with regard to information security;

2)

takes into account business and legal or regulatory requirements, and contractual security
obligations;

3)

aligns with the organization’s strategic risk management context in which the establishment and
maintenance of the ISMS will take place;

4)

establishes criteria against which risk will be evaluated (see 4.2.1c)); and

5)

has been approved by management.

NOTE: For the purposes of this International Standard, the ISMS policy is considered as a superset of the
information security policy. These policies can be described in one document.

c) Define the risk assessment approach of the organization.
1)

Identify a risk assessment methodology that is suited to the ISMS, and the identified business
information security, legal and regulatory requirements.

2)

Develop criteria for accepting risks and identify the acceptable levels of risk. (see 5.1f)).

The risk assessment methodology selected shall ensure that risk assessments produce comparable and
reproducible results.
NOTE: There are different methodologies for risk assessment. Examples of risk assessment methodologies are
discussed in ISO/IEC TR 13335-3, Information technology — Guidelines for the management of IT Security —
Techniques for the management of IT Security.

d) Identify the risks.
1)

Identify the assets within the scope of the ISMS, and the owners2) of these assets.

2)

Identify the threats to those assets.

3)

Identify the vulnerabilities that might be exploited by the threats.

4)

Identify the impacts that losses of confidentiality, integrity and availability may have on the assets.

2) The term ‘owner’ identifies an individual or entity that has approved management responsibility for controlling the
production, development, maintenance, use and security of the assets. The term ’owner’ does not mean that the person
actually has any property rights to the asset.

e) Analyse and evaluate the risks.

f)

1)

Assess the business impacts upon the organization that might result from security failures, taking into
account the consequences of a loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability of the assets.

2)

Assess the realistic likelihood of security failures occurring in the light of prevailing threats and
vulnerabilities, and impacts associated with these assets, and the controls currently implemented.

3)

Estimate the levels of risks.

4)

Determine whether the risks are acceptable or require treatment using the criteria for accepting risks
established in 4.2.1c)2).

Identify and evaluate options for the treatment of risks.
Possible actions include:
1)

applying appropriate controls;

2)

knowingly and objectively accepting risks, providing they clearly satisfy the organization’s policies
and the criteria for accepting risks (see 4.2.1c)2));

3)

avoiding risks; and

4)

transferring the associated business risks to other parties, e.g. insurers, suppliers.

g) Select control objectives and controls for the treatment of risks.
Control objectives and controls shall be selected and implemented to meet the requirements identified by
the risk assessment and risk treatment process. This selection shall take account of the criteria for
accepting risks (see 4.2.1c)2)) as well as legal, regulatory and contractual requirements.
The control objectives and controls from Annex A shall be selected as part of this process as suitable to
cover the identified requirements.
The control objectives and controls listed in Annex A are not exhaustive and additional control objectives
and controls may also be selected.
NOTE:
Annex A contains a comprehensive list of control objectives and controls that have been found to be
commonly relevant in organizations. Users of this International Standard are directed to Annex A as a starting point
for control selection to ensure that no important control options are overlooked.

h) Obtain management approval of the proposed residual risks.
i)

Obtain management authorization to implement and operate the ISMS.

j)

Prepare a Statement of Applicability.
A Statement of Applicability shall be prepared that includes the following:
1)

the control objectives and controls selected in 4.2.1g) and the reasons for their selection;

2)

the control objectives and controls currently implemented (see 4.2.1e)2)); and

3)

the exclusion of any control objectives and controls in Annex A and the justification for their
exclusion.

NOTE: The Statement of Applicability provides a summary of decisions concerning risk treatment. Justifying
exclusions provides a cross-check that no controls have been inadvertently omitted.

Annex B
(informative)
OECD principles and this International Standard

The principles given in the OECD Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks apply to all
policy and operational levels that govern the security of information systems and networks. This International
Standard provides an information security management system framework for implementing some of the
OECD principles using the PDCA model and the processes described in Clauses 4, 5, 6 and 8, as indicated in
Table B.1.
Table B.1 — OECD principles and the PDCA model
OECD principle

Corresponding ISMS process and PDCA phase

Awareness

This activity is part of the Do phase (see 4.2.2 and 5.2.2).

Participants should be aware of the need for security of
information systems and networks and what they can do
to enhance security.
Responsibility

This activity is part of the Do phase (see 4.2.2 and 5.1).

All participants are responsible for the security of
information systems and networks.
Response
Participants should act in a timely and co-operative
manner to prevent, detect and respond to security
incidents.
Risk assessment
Participants should conduct risk assessments.
Security design and implementation
Participants should incorporate security as an essential
element of information systems and networks.

Security management
Participants should adopt a comprehensive approach to
security management.
Reassessment
Participants should review and reassess the security of
information systems and networks, and make
appropriate modifications to security policies, practices,
measures and procedures.

This is in part a monitoring activity Check phase (see
4.2.3 and 6 to 7.3) and a responding activity Act phase
(see 4.2.4 and 8.1 to 8.3). This can also be covered by
some aspects of the Plan and Check phases.

This activity is part of the Plan phase (see 4.2.1) and risk
reassessment is part of the Check phase (see 4.2.3 and 6
to 7.3).
Once a risk assessment has been completed, controls are
selected for the treatment of risks as part of the Plan
phase (see 4.2.1). The Do phase (see 4.2.2 and 5.2) then
covers the implementation and operational use of these
controls.
The management of risk is a process which includes the
prevention, detection and response to incidents, ongoing
maintenance, review and audit. All of these aspects are
encompassed in the Plan, Do, Check and Act phases.
Reassessment of information security is a part of the
Check phase (see 4.2.3 and 6 to 7.3) where regular
reviews should be undertaken to check the effectiveness
of the information security management system, and
improving the security is part of the Act phase (see 4.2.4
and 8.1 to 8.3).

Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27002 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.
This first edition of ISO/IEC 27002 comprises ISO/IEC 17799:2005 and ISO/IEC 17799:2005/Cor.1:2007. Its
technical content is identical to that of ISO/IEC 17799:2005. ISO/IEC 17799:2005/Cor.1:2007 changes the
reference
number
of
the
standard
from
17799
to
27002.
ISO/IEC 17799:2005
and
ISO/IEC 17799:2005/Cor.1:2007 are provisionally retained until publication of the second edition of
ISO/IEC 27002.

Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are
members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical
committees established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical
activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international
organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the
work. In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical
committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives,
Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft
International Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for
voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national
bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of
patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 17799 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.
This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO/IEC 17799:2000), which has been
technically revised.
A family of Information Security Management System (ISMS) International Standards is being
developed within ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27. The family includes International Standards on information
security management system requirements, risk management, metrics and measurement, and
implementation guidance. This family will adopt a numbering scheme using the series of numbers
27000 et seq.
From 2007, it is proposed to incorporate the new edition of ISO/IEC 17799 into this new numbering
scheme as ISO/IEC 27002.

Introduction

0.1

What is information security?

Information is an asset that, like other important business assets, is essential to an organization’s
business and consequently needs to be suitably protected. This is especially important in the
increasingly interconnected business environment. As a result of this increasing interconnectivity,
information is now exposed to a growing number and a wider variety of threats and vulnerabilities
(see also OECD Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks).
Information can exist in many forms. It can be printed or written on paper, stored electronically,
transmitted by post or by using electronic means, shown on films, or spoken in conversation.
Whatever form the information takes, or means by which it is shared or stored, it should always be
appropriately protected.
Information security is the protection of information from a wide range of threats in order to ensure
business continuity, minimize business risk, and maximize return on investments and business
opportunities.
Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, including policies,
processes, procedures, organizational structures and software and hardware functions. These controls
need to be established, implemented, monitored, reviewed and improved, where necessary, to ensure
that the specific security and business objectives of the organization are met. This should be done in
conjunction with other business management processes.

0.2

Why information security is needed?

Information and the supporting processes, systems, and networks are important business assets.
Defining, achieving, maintaining, and improving information security may be essential to maintain
competitive edge, cash flow, profitability, legal compliance, and commercial image.
Organizations and their information systems and networks are faced with security threats from a wide
range of sources, including computer-assisted fraud, espionage, sabotage, vandalism, fire or flood.
Causes of damage such as malicious code, computer hacking, and denial of service attacks have
become more common, more ambitious, and increasingly sophisticated.
Information security is important to both public and private sector businesses, and to protect critical
infrastructures. In both sectors, information security will function as an enabler, e.g. to achieve egovernment or e-business, and to avoid or reduce relevant risks. The interconnection of public and
private networks and the sharing of information resources increase the difficulty of achieving access
control. The trend to distributed computing has also weakened the effectiveness of central, specialist
control.
Many information systems have not been designed to be secure. The security that can be achieved
through technical means is limited, and should be supported by appropriate management and
procedures. Identifying which controls should be in place requires careful planning and attention to
detail. Information security management requires, as a minimum, participation by all employees in the
organization. It may also require participation from shareholders, suppliers, third parties, customers or
other external parties. Specialist advice from outside organizations may also be needed.

0.3

How to establish security requirements

It is essential that an organization identifies its security requirements. There are three main sources of
security requirements.
1. One source is derived from assessing risks to the organization, taking into account the
organization’s overall business strategy and objectives. Through a risk assessment, threats to
assets are identified, vulnerability to and likelihood of occurrence is evaluated and potential
impact is estimated.
2. Another source is the legal, statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements that an
organization, its trading partners, contractors, and service providers have to satisfy, and their
socio-cultural environment.
3. A further source is the particular set of principles, objectives and business requirements for

information processing that an organization has developed to support its operations.

0.4

Assessing security risks

Security requirements are identified by a methodical assessment of security risks. Expenditure on
controls needs to be balanced against the business harm likely to result from security failures.
The results of the risk assessment will help to guide and determine the appropriate management action
and priorities for managing information security risks, and for implementing controls selected to
protect against these risks.
Risk assessment should be repeated periodically to address any changes that might influence the risk
assessment results.
More information about the assessment of security risks can be found in clause 4.1 “Assessing
security risks”.

0.5

Selecting controls

Once security requirements and risks have been identified and decisions for the treatment of risks
have been made, appropriate controls should be selected and implemented to ensure risks are reduced
to an acceptable level. Controls can be selected from this standard or from other control sets, or new
controls can be designed to meet specific needs as appropriate. The selection of security controls is
dependent upon organizational decisions based on the criteria for risk acceptance, risk treatment
options, and the general risk management approach applied to the organization, and should also be
subject to all relevant national and international legislation and regulations.
Some of the controls in this standard can be considered as guiding principles for information security
management and applicable for most organizations. They are explained in more detail below under the
heading “Information security starting point”.
More information about selecting controls and other risk treatment options can be found in clause 4.2
"Treating security risks".

0.6

Information security starting point

A number of controls can be considered as a good starting point for implementing information
security. They are either based on essential legislative requirements or considered to be common
practice for information security.

Controls considered to be essential to an organization from a legislative point of view include,
depending on applicable legislation:
a)

data protection and privacy of personal information (see 15.1.4);

b)

protection of organizational records (see 15.1.3);

c)

intellectual property rights (see 15.1.2).

Controls considered to be common practice for information security include:
a)

information security policy document (see 5.1.1);

b)

allocation of information security responsibilities (see 6.1.3);

c)

information security awareness, education, and training (see 8.2.2);

d)

correct processing in applications (see 12.2);

e)

technical vulnerability management (see 12.6);

f)

business continuity management (see 14);

g)

management of information security incidents and improvements (see 13.2).

These controls apply to most organizations and in most environments.
It should be noted that although all controls in this standard are important and should be considered,
the relevance of any control should be determined in the light of the specific risks an organization is
facing. Hence, although the above approach is considered a good starting point, it does not replace
selection of controls based on a risk assessment.

Critical success factors

Experience has shown that the following factors are often critical to the successful implementation of
information security within an organization:

1

a)

information security policy, objectives, and activities that reflect business objectives;

b)

an approach and framework to implementing, maintaining, monitoring, and improving
information security that is consistent with the organizational culture;

c)

visible support and commitment from all levels of management;

d)

a good understanding of the information security requirements, risk assessment, and risk
management;

e)

effective marketing of information security to all managers, employees, and other parties to
achieve awareness;

Developing your own guidelines

This code of practice may be regarded as a starting point for developing organization specific
guidelines. Not all of the controls and guidance in this code of practice may be applicable.
Furthermore, additional controls and guidelines not included in this standard may be required. When
documents are developed containing additional guidelines or controls, it may be useful to include
cross-references to clauses in this standard where applicable to facilitate compliance checking by
auditors and business partners.

Note: The order of the clauses in this standard does not imply their importance. Depending on the
circumstances, all clauses could be important, therefore each organization applying this standard
should identify applicable clauses, how important these are and their application to individual
business processes. Also, all lists in this standard are not in priority order unless so noted.

3.2

Main security categories

Each main security category contains:
a) a control objective stating what is to be achieved; and
b) one or more controls that can be applied to achieve the control objective.
Control descriptions are structured as follows:
Control
Defines the specific control statement to satisfy the control objective.
Implementation guidance
Provides more detailed information to support the implementation of the control and meeting the
control objective. Some of this guidance may not be suitable in all cases and so other ways of
implementing the control may be more appropriate.

Risk assessment and treatment

4.1

Assessing security risks

Risk assessments should identify, quantify, and prioritize risks against criteria for risk acceptance and
objectives relevant to the organization. The results should guide and determine the appropriate
management action and priorities for managing information security risks and for implementing
controls selected to protect against these risks. The process of assessing risks and selecting controls
may need to be performed a number of times to cover different parts of the organization or individual
information systems.
Risk assessment should include the systematic approach of estimating the magnitude of risks (risk
analysis) and the process of comparing the estimated risks against risk criteria to determine the
significance of the risks (risk evaluation).
Risk assessments should also be performed periodically to address changes in the security
requirements and in the risk situation, e.g. in the assets, threats, vulnerabilities, impacts, the risk
evaluation, and when significant changes occur. These risk assessments should be undertaken in a
methodical manner capable of producing comparable and reproducible results.
The information security risk assessment should have a clearly defined scope in order to be effective
and should include relationships with risk assessments in other areas, if appropriate.
The scope of a risk assessment can be either the whole organization, parts of the organization, an
individual information system, specific system components, or services where this is practicable,
realistic, and helpful. Examples of risk assessment methodologies are discussed in ISO/IEC TR
13335-3 (Guidelines for the Management of IT Security: Techniques for the Management of IT
Security).

4.2

Treating security risks

Before considering the treatment of a risk, the organization should decide criteria for determining
whether or not risks can be accepted. Risks may be accepted if, for example, it is assessed that the risk
is low or that the cost of treatment is not cost-effective for the organization. Such decisions should be
recorded.
For each of the risks identified following the risk assessment a risk treatment decision needs to be
made. Possible options for risk treatment include:
a) applying appropriate controls to reduce the risks;
b) knowingly and objectively accepting risks, providing they clearly satisfy the
organization’s policy and criteria for risk acceptance;
c) avoiding risks by not allowing actions that would cause the risks to occur;
d) transferring the associated risks to other parties, e.g. insurers or suppliers.
For those risks where the risk treatment decision has been to apply appropriate controls, these controls
should be selected and implemented to meet the requirements identified by a risk assessment. Controls
should ensure that risks are reduced to an acceptable level taking into account:
a) requirements and constraints of national and international legislation and regulations;
b) organizational objectives;
c) operational requirements and constraints;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
d) cost of implementation and operation in relation to the risks being reduced, and remaining
proportional to the organization’s requirements and constraints;
e) the need to balance the investment in implementation and operation of controls against the
harm likely to result from security failures.
Controls can be selected from this standard or from other control sets, or new controls can be designed
to meet the specific needs of the organization. It is necessary to recognize that some controls may not
be applicable to every information system or environment, and might not be practicable for all
organizations. As an example, 10.1.3 describes how duties may be segregated to prevent fraud and
error. It may not be possible for smaller organizations to segregate all duties and other ways of
achieving the same control objective may be necessary. As another example, 10.10 describes how
system use can be monitored and evidence collected. The described controls e.g. event logging, might
conflict with applicable legislation, such as privacy protection for customers or in the workplace.
Information security controls should be considered at the systems and projects requirements
specification and design stage. Failure to do so can result in additional costs and less effective
solutions, and maybe, in the worst case, inability to achieve adequate security.
It should be kept in mind that no set of controls can achieve complete security, and that additional
management action should be implemented to monitor, evaluate, and improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of security controls to support the organization’s aims.

Security policy

5.1

Information security policy

Objective: To provide management direction and support for information security in accordance with
business requirements and relevant laws and regulations.
Management should set a clear policy direction in line with business objectives and demonstrate
support for, and commitment to, information security through the issue and maintenance of an
information security policy across the organization.

5.1.1

Information security policy document

Control
An information security policy document should be approved by management, and published and
communicated to all employees and relevant external parties.
Implementation guidance
The information security policy document should state management commitment and set out the
organization’s approach to managing information security. The policy document should contain
statements concerning:
a) a definition of information security, its overall objectives and scope and the importance of
security as an enabling mechanism for information sharing (see introduction);
b) a statement of management intent, supporting the goals and principles of information
security in line with the business strategy and objectives;
c) a framework for setting control objectives and controls, including the structure of risk
assessment and risk management;
d) a brief explanation of the security policies, principles, standards, and compliance
requirements of particular importance to the organization, including:
1) compliance with legislative, regulatory, and contractual requirements;
2) security education, training, and awareness requirements;
3) business continuity management;
4) consequences of information security policy violations;
e) a definition of general and specific responsibilities for information security management,
including reporting information security incidents;
f) references to documentation which may support the policy, e.g. more detailed security
policies and procedures for specific information systems or security rules users should
comply with.
This information security policy should be communicated throughout the organization to users in a
form that is relevant, accessible and understandable to the intended reader.
Other information
The information security policy might be a part of a general policy document. If the information
security policy is distributed outside the organisation, care should be taken not to disclose sensitive
information. Further information can be found in the ISO/IEC 13335-1:2004.

5.1.2

Review of the information security policy

Control
The information security policy should be reviewed at planned intervals or if significant changes
occur to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.
Implementation guidance
The information security policy should have an owner who has approved management responsibility
for the development, review, and evaluation of the security policy. The review should include
assessing opportunities for improvement of the organization’s information security policy and
approach to managing information security in response to changes to the organizational environment,
business circumstances, legal conditions, or technical environment.
The review of the information security policy should take account of the results of management
reviews. There should be defined management review procedures, including a schedule or period of
the review.
The input to the management review should include information on:
a) feedback from interested parties;
b) results of independent reviews (see 6.1.8);
c) status of preventive and corrective actions (see 6.1.8 and 15.2.1);
d) results of previous management reviews;
e) process performance and information security policy compliance;
f) changes that could affect the organization’s approach to managing information security,
including changes to the organizational environment, business circumstances, resource
availability, contractual, regulatory, and legal conditions, or to the technical environment;
g) trends related to threats and vulnerabilities;
h) reported information security incidents (see 13.1);
i)

recommendations provided by relevant authorities (see 6.1.6).

The output from the management review should include any decisions and actions related to:
a) improvement of the organization’s approach to managing information security and its
processes;
b) improvement of control objectives and controls;
c) improvement in the allocation of resources and/or responsibilities.
A record of the management review should be maintained.
Management approval for the revised policy should be obtained.

Organization of information security

6.1

Internal organization

Objective: To manage information security within the organization.
A management framework should be established to initiate and control the implementation of
information security within the organization.
Management should approve the information security policy, assign security roles and co-ordinate and
review the implementation of security across the organization.
If necessary, a source of specialist information security advice should be established and made
available within the organization. Contacts with external security specialists or groups, including
relevant authorities, should be developed to keep up with industrial trends, monitor standards and
assessment methods and provide suitable liaison points when handling information security incidents.
A multi-disciplinary approach to information security should be encouraged.

6.1.1

Management commitment to information security

Control
Management should actively support security within the organization through clear direction,
demonstrated commitment, explicit assignment, and acknowledgment of information security
responsibilities.
Implementation guidance
Management should:
a) ensure that information security goals are identified, meet the organizational
requirements, and are integrated in relevant processes;
b) formulate, review, and approve information security policy;
c) review the effectiveness of the implementation of the information security policy;
d) provide clear direction and visible management support for security initiatives;
e) provide the resources needed for information security;
f) approve assignment of specific roles and responsibilities for information security across
the organization;
g) initiate plans and programs to maintain information security awareness;
h) ensure that the implementation of information security controls is co-ordinated across
the organization (see 6.1.2).
Management should identify the needs for internal or external specialist information security advice,
and review and coordinate results of the advice throughout the organization.
Depending on the size of the organization, such responsibilities could be handled by a dedicated
management forum or by an existing management body, such as the board of directors.
Other information
Further information is contained in ISO/IEC 13335-1:2004.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)

6.1.2

Information security co-ordination

Control
Information security activities should be co-ordinated by representatives from different parts of the
organization with relevant roles and job functions.
Implementation guidance
Typically, information security co-ordination should involve the co-operation and collaboration of
managers, users, administrators, application designers, auditors and security personnel, and
specialist skills in areas such as insurance, legal issues, human resources, IT or risk management.
This activity should:
a) ensure that security activities are executed in compliance with the information security
policy;
b) identify how to handle non-compliances;
c) approve methodologies and processes for information security, e.g. risk assessment,
information classification;
d) identify significant threat changes and exposure of information and information
processing facilities to threats;
e) assess the adequacy and co-ordinate the implementation of information security
controls;
f) effectively promote information security education, training and awareness throughout
the organization;
g) evaluate information received from the monitoring and reviewing of information
security incidents, and recommend appropriate actions in response to identified
information security incidents.
If the organization does not use a separate cross-functional group, e.g. because such a group is not
appropriate for the organization’s size, the actions described above should be undertaken by another
suitable management body or individual manager.

6.1.3

Allocation of information security responsibilities

Control
All information security responsibilities should be clearly defined.
Implementation guidance
Allocation of information security responsibilities should be done in accordance with the information
security policy (see clause 4). Responsibilities for the protection of individual assets and for carrying
out specific security processes should be clearly identified. This responsibility should be
supplemented, where necessary, with more detailed guidance for specific sites and information
processing facilities. Local responsibilities for the protection of assets and for carrying out specific
security processes, such as business continuity planning, should be clearly defined.
Individuals with allocated security responsibilities may delegate security tasks to others. Nevertheless
they remain responsible and should determine that any delegated tasks have been correctly performed.
Areas for which individuals are responsible should be clearly stated; in particular the following should
take place:
a) the assets and security processes associated with each particular system should be
identified and clearly defined;
b) the entity responsible for each asset or security process should be assigned and the details
of this responsibility should be documented (see also 7.1.2);
c) authorization levels
should
bePEDDINTI
clearly defined and documented.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Other information
In many organizations an information security manager will be appointed to take overall responsibility
for the development and implementation of security and to support the identification of controls.
However, responsibility for resourcing and implementing the controls will often remain with
individual managers. One common practice is to appoint an owner for each asset who then becomes
responsible for its day-to-day protection.

6.1.4

Authorization process for information processing facilities

Control
A management authorization process for new information processing facilities should be defined and
implemented.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered for the authorization process:
a) new facilities should have appropriate user management authorization, authorizing their
purpose and use. Authorization should also be obtained from the manager responsible for
maintaining the local information system security environment to ensure that all relevant
security policies and requirements are met;
b) where necessary, hardware and software should be checked to ensure that they are
compatible with other system components;
c) the use of personal or privately owned information processing facilities, e.g. laptops,
home-computers or hand-held devices, for processing business information, may
introduce new vulnerabilities and necessary controls should be identified and
implemented.

6.1.5

Confidentiality agreements

Control
Requirements for confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements reflecting the organization’s needs for
the protection of information should be identified and regularly reviewed.
Implementation guidance
Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements should address the requirement to protect confidential
information using legally enforceable terms. To identify requirements for confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements, the following elements should be considered:
a) a definition of the information to be protected (e.g. confidential information);
b) expected duration of an agreement, including cases where confidentiality might need to be
maintained indefinitely;
c) required actions when an agreement is terminated;
d) responsibilities and actions of signatories to avoid unauthorized information disclosure
(such as ‘need to know’);
e) ownership of information, trade secrets and intellectual property, and how this relates to
the protection of confidential information;
f) the permitted use of confidential information, and rights of the signatory to use
information;
g) the right to audit and monitor activities that involve confidential information;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
h) process for notification and reporting of unauthorized disclosure or confidential
information breaches;
i)

terms for information to be returned or destroyed at agreement cessation; and

j)

expected actions to be taken in case of a breach of this agreement.

Based on an organization’s security requirements, other elements may be needed in a confidentiality
or non-disclosure agreement.
Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements should comply with all applicable laws and regulations
for the jurisdiction to which it applies (see also 15.1.1).
Requirements for confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements should be reviewed periodically and
when changes occur that influence these requirements.
Other Information
Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements protect organisational information and inform
signatories of their responsibility to protect, use, and disclose information in a responsible and
authorised manner.
There may be a need for an organisation to use different forms of confidentiality or non-disclose
agreements in different circumstances.

6.1.6

Contact with authorities

Control
Appropriate contacts with relevant authorities should be maintained.
Implementation guidance
Organizations should have procedures in place that specify when and by whom authorities (e.g. law
enforcement, fire department, supervisory authorities) should be contacted, and how identified
information security incidents should be reported in a timely manner if it is suspected that laws may
have been broken.
Organizations under attack from the Internet may need external third parties (e.g. an Internet service
provider or telecommunications operator) to take action against the attack source.
Other information
Maintaining such contacts may be a requirement to support information security incident management
(Section 13.2) or the business continuity and contingency planning process (Section 14). Contacts
with regulatory bodies are also useful to anticipate and prepare for upcoming changes in law or
regulations, which have to be followed by the organization. Contacts with other authorities include
utilities, emergency services, and health and safety, e.g. fire departments (in connection with business
continuity), telecommunication providers (in connection with line routing and availability),
water suppliers (in connection with cooling facilities for equipment).

6.1.7

Contact with special interest groups

Control
Appropriate contacts with special interest groups or other specialist security forums and professional
associations should be maintained.
Implementation guidance
Membership in special interest groups or forums should be considered as a means to:
a) improve knowledge about best practices and staying up to date with relevant security
information;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
b) ensure the understanding of the information security environment is current and complete;
c) receive early warnings of alerts, advisories, and patches pertaining to attacks and
vulnerabilities;
d) gain access to specialist information security advice;
e) share and exchange information about new technologies, products, threats, or
vulnerabilities;
f) provide suitable liaison points when dealing with information security incidents (see also
13.2.1).
Other information
Information sharing agreements can be established to improve cooperation and coordination of
security issues. Such agreements should identify requirements for the protection of sensitive
information.

6.1.8

Independent review of information security

Control
The organization’s approach to managing information security and its implementation (i.e. control
objectives, controls, policies, processes, and procedures for information security) should be reviewed
independently at planned intervals, or when significant changes to the security implementation occur.
Implementation guidance
The independent review should be initiated by management. Such an independent review is necessary
to ensure the continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the organization's approach to
managing information security. The review should include assessing opportunities for improvement
and the need for changes to the approach to security, including the policy and control objectives.
Such a review should be carried out by individuals independent of the area under review, e.g. the
internal audit function, an independent manager or a third party organization specializing in such
reviews. Individuals carrying out these reviews should have the appropriate skills and experience.
The results of the independent review should be recorded and reported to the management who
initiated the review. These records should be maintained.
If the independent review identifies that the organization’s approach and implementation to managing
information security is inadequate or not compliant with the direction for information security stated
in the information security policy document (see 5.1.1), management should consider corrective
actions.
Other information
The area, which managers should regularly review (see 15.2.1), may also be reviewed independently.
Review techniques may include interviews of management, checking records or review of security
policy documents. ISO 19011:2002, Guidelines for quality and/or environmental management
systems auditing, may also provide helpful guidance for carrying out the independent review,
including establishment and implementation of a review programme. Section 15.3 specifies controls
relevant to the independent review of operational information systems and the use of system audit
tools.

6.2

External parties

Objective: To maintain the security of the organization’s information and information processing
facilities that are accessed, processed, communicated to, or managed by external parties.
The security of the organization’s information and information processing facilities should not be
reduced by the introduction of external party products or services.
Any access to the organization’s information processing facilities and processing and communication
of information by external parties should be controlled.
Where there is a business need for working with external parties that may require access to the
organization’s information and information processing facilities, or in obtaining or providing a
product and service from or to an external party, a risk assessment should be carried out to determine
security implications and control requirements. Controls should be agreed and defined in an
agreement with the external party.

6.2.1

Identification of risks related to external parties

Control
The risks to the organization’s information and information processing facilities from business
processes involving external parties should be identified and appropriate controls implemented before
granting access.
Implementation guidance
Where there is a need to allow an external party access to the information processing facilities or
information of an organization, a risk assessment (see also Section 4) should be carried out to identify
any requirements for specific controls. The identification of risks related to external party access
should take into account the following issues:
a) the information processing facilities an external party is required to access;
b) the type of access the external party will have to the information and information
processing facilities, e.g.:
1)

physical access, e.g. to offices, computer rooms, filing cabinets;

2)

logical access, e.g. to an organization’s databases, information systems;

3)

network connectivity between the organization’s and the external party’s
network(s), e.g. permanent connection, remote access;

4)

whether the access is taking place on-site or off-site;

c) the value and sensitivity of the information involved, and its criticality for business
operations;
d) the controls necessary to protect information that is not intended to be accessible by
external parties;
e) the external party personnel involved in handling the organization’s information;
f) how the organization or personnel authorized to have access can be identified, the
authorization verified, and how often this needs to be reconfirmed;
g) the different means and controls employed by the external party when storing, processing,
communicating, sharing and exchanging information;
h) the impact of access not being available to the external party when required, and the
external party entering or receiving inaccurate or misleading information;
i)

practices and procedures to deal with information security incidents and potential
damages, and the terms and conditions for the continuation of external party access in the
case of an information security incident;

j)

legal and regulatory requirements and other contractual obligations relevant to the
external party that should be taken into account;

k) how the interests of any other stakeholders may be affected by the arrangements.
Access by external parties to the organization’s information should not be provided until the
appropriate controls have been implemented and, where feasible, a contract has been signed defining
the terms and conditions for the connection or access and the working arrangement. Generally, all
security requirements resulting from work with external parties or internal controls should be reflected
by the agreement with the external party (see also 6.2.2 and 6.2.3).
It should be ensured that the external party is aware of their obligations, and accepts the
responsibilities and liabilities involved in accessing, processing, communicating, or managing the
organization’s information and information processing facilities.
Other information
Information might be put at risk by external parties with inadequate security management. Controls
should be identified and applied to administer external party access to information processing
facilities. For example, if there is a special need for confidentiality of the information, non-disclosure
agreements might be used.
Organizations may face risks associated with inter-organizational processes, management, and
communication if a high degree of outsourcing is applied, or where there are several external parties
involved.
The controls 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 cover different external party arrangements, e.g. including:
a) service providers, such as ISPs, network providers, telephone services, maintenance and
support services;
b) managed security services;
c) customers;
d) outsourcing of facilities and/or operations, e.g. IT systems, data collection services, call
centre operations;
e) management and business consultants, and auditors;
f) developers and suppliers, e.g. of software products and IT systems;
g) cleaning, catering, and other outsourced support services;
h) temporary personnel, student placement, and other casual short-term appointments.
Such agreements can help to reduce the risks associated with external parties.

6.2.2

Addressing security when dealing with customers

Control
All identified security requirements should be addressed before giving customers access to the
organization’s information or assets.
Implementation guidance
The following terms should be considered to address security prior to giving customers access to any
of the organization’s assets (depending on the type and extent of access given, not all of them might
apply):
a) asset protection, including:
1) procedures to protect the organization’s assets, including information and software,
and management of known vulnerabilities;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
2) procedures to determine whether any compromise of the assets, e.g. loss or
modification of data, has occurred;
3) integrity;
4) restrictions on copying and disclosing information;
b) description of the product or service to be provided;
c) the different reasons, requirements, and benefits for customer access;
d) access control policy, covering:
1) permitted access methods, and the control and use of unique identifiers such as user
IDs and passwords;
2) an authorization process for user access and privileges;
3) a statement that all access that is not explicitly authorised is forbidden;
4) a process for revoking access rights or interrupting the connection between systems;
e) arrangements for reporting, notification, and investigation of information inaccuracies
(e.g. of personal details), information security incidents and security breaches;
f) a description of each service to be made available;
g) the target level of service and unacceptable levels of service;
h) the right to monitor, and revoke, any activity related to the organization’s assets;
i)

the respective liabilities of the organization and the customer;

j)

responsibilities with respect to legal matters and how it is ensured that the legal
requirements are met, e.g. data protection legislation, especially taking into account
different national legal systems if the agreement involves co-operation with customers in
other countries (see also 15.1);

k) intellectual property rights (IPRs) and copyright assignment (see 15.1.2) and protection of
any collaborative work (see also 6.1.5).
Other information
The security requirements related to customers accessing organizational assets can vary considerably
depending on the information processing facilities and information being accessed. These security
requirements can be addressed using customer agreements, which contain all identified risks and
security requirements (see 6.2.1).
Agreements with external parties may also involve other parties. Agreements granting external party
access should include allowance for designation of other eligible parties and conditions for their
access and involvement.

6.2.3

Addressing security in third party agreements

Control
Agreements with third parties involving accessing, processing, communicating or managing the
organization’s information or information processing facilities, or adding products or services to
information processing facilities should cover all relevant security requirements.
Implementation guidance
The agreement should ensure that there is no misunderstanding between the organization and the third
party. Organizations should satisfy themselves as to the indemnity of the third party.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
o) the right to audit responsibilities defined in the agreement, to have those audits carried out
by a third party, and to enumerate the statutory rights of auditors;
p) the establishment of an escalation process for problem resolution;
q) service continuity requirements, including measures for availability and reliability, in
accordance with an organization’s business priorities;
r) the respective liabilities of the parties to the agreement;
s) responsibilities with respect to legal matters and how it is ensured that the legal
requirements are met, e.g. data protection legislation, especially taking into account
different national legal systems if the agreement involves co-operation with organizations
in other countries (see also 15.1);
t)

intellectual property rights (IPRs) and copyright assignment (see 15.1.2) and protection of
any collaborative work (see also 6.1.5);

u) involvement of the third party with subcontractors, and the security controls these
subcontractors need to implement;
v) conditions for renegotiation/termination of agreements:
1) a contingency plan should be in place in case either party wishes to terminate the
relation before the end of the agreements;
2) renegotiation of agreements if the security requirements of the organization change;
3) current documentation of asset lists, licences, agreements or rights relating to them.
Other information
The agreements can vary considerably for different organizations and among the different types of
third parties. Therefore, care should be taken to include all identified risks and security requirements
(see also 6.2.1) in the agreements. Where necessary, the required controls and procedures can be
expanded in a security management plan.
If information security management is outsourced, the agreements should address how the third party
will guarantee that adequate security, as defined by the risk assessment, will be maintained, and how
security will be adapted to identify and deal with changes to risks.
Some of the differences between outsourcing and the other forms of third party service provision
include the question of liability, planning the transition period and potential disruption of operations
during this period, contingency planning arrangements and due diligence reviews, and collection and
management of information on security incidents. Therefore, it is important that the organization
plans and manages the transition to an outsourced arrangement and has suitable processes in place to
manage changes and the renegotiation/termination of agreements.
The procedures for continuing processing in the event that the third party becomes unable to supply its
services need to be considered in the agreement to avoid any delay in arranging replacement services.
Agreements with third parties may also involve other parties. Agreements granting third party access
should include allowance for designation of other eligible parties and conditions for their access and
involvement.
Generally agreements are primarily developed by the organization. There may be occasions in some
circumstances where an agreement may be developed and imposed upon an organization by a third
party. The organization needs to ensure that its own security is not unnecessarily impacted by third
party requirements stipulated in imposed agreements.

Asset management

7.1

Responsibility for assets

Objective: To achieve and maintain appropriate protection of organizational assets.
All assets should be accounted for and have a nominated owner.
Owners should be identified for all assets and the responsibility for the maintenance of appropriate
controls should be assigned. The implementation of specific controls may be delegated by the owner
as appropriate but the owner remains responsible for the proper protection of the assets.

7.1.1

Inventory of assets

Control
All assets should be clearly identified and an inventory of all important assets drawn up and
maintained.
Implementation guidance
An organization should identify all assets and document the importance of these assets. The asset
inventory should include all information necessary in order to recover from a disaster, including type
of asset, format, location, backup information, license information, and a business value. The
inventory should not duplicate other inventories unnecessarily, but it should be ensured that the
content is aligned.
In addition, ownership (see 7.1.2) and information classification (see 7.2) should be agreed and
documented for each of the assets. Based on the importance of the asset, its business value and its
security classification, levels of protection commensurate with the importance of the assets should be
identified (more information on how to value assets to represent their importance can be found in
ISO/IEC TR 13335-3).
Other information
There are many types of assets, including:
a) information: databases and data files, contracts and agreements, system documentation,
research information, user manuals, training material, operational or support procedures,
business continuity plans, fallback arrangements, audit trails, and archived information;
b) software assets: application software, system software, development tools, and utilities;
c) physical assets: computer equipment, communications equipment, removable media, and
other equipment;
d) services: computing and communications services, general utilities, e.g. heating, lighting,
power, and air-conditioning;
e) people, and their qualifications, skills, and experience;
f) intangibles, such as reputation and image of the organization.
Inventories of assets help to ensure that effective asset protection takes place, and may also be
required for other business purposes, such as health and safety, insurance or financial (asset
management) reasons. The process of compiling an inventory of assets is an important prerequisite of
risk management (see also Section 4).

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)

7.1.2

Ownership of assets

Control
All information and assets associated with information processing facilities should be owned2 by a
designated part of the organization.
Implementation guidance
The asset owner should be responsible for:
a) ensuring that information and assets associated with information processing facilities are
appropriately classified;
b) defining and periodically reviewing access restrictions and classifications, taking into
account applicable access control policies.
Ownership may be allocated to:
a) a business process;
b) a defined set of activities;
c) an application; or
d) a defined set of data.
Other information
Routine tasks may be delegated, e.g. to a custodian looking after the asset on a daily basis, but the
responsibility remains with the owner.
In complex information systems it may be useful to designate groups of assets, which act together to
provide a particular function as ‘services’. In this case the service owner is responsible for the delivery
of the service, including the functioning of the assets, which provide it.

7.1.3

Acceptable use of assets

Control
Rules for the acceptable use of information and assets associated with information processing
facilities should be identified, documented, and implemented.
Implementation guidance
All employees, contractors and third party users should follow rules for the acceptable use of
information and assets associated with information processing facilities, including:
a) rules for electronic mail and Internet usages (see 10.8);
b) guidelines for the use of mobile devices, especially for the use outside the premises of the
organization (see 11.7.1);
Specific rules or guidance should be provided by the relevant management. Employees, contractors
and third party users using or having access to the organization’s assets should be aware of the limits
existing for their use of organization’s information and assets associated with information processing
facilities, and resources. They should be responsible for their use of any information processing
resources, and of any such use carried out under their responsibility.

2

The term ‘owner’ identifies an individual or entity that has approved management responsibility for
controlling the production, development, maintenance, use and security of the assets. The term
’owner’ does not mean that the person actually has any property rights to the asset.

7.2

Information classification

Objective: To ensure that information receives an appropriate level of protection.
Information should be classified to indicate the need, priorities, and expected degree of protection
when handling the information.
Information has varying degrees of sensitivity and criticality. Some items may require an additional
level of protection or special handling. An information classification scheme should be used to define
an appropriate set of protection levels and communicate the need for special handling measures.

7.2.1

Classification guidelines

Control
Information should be classified in terms of its value, legal requirements, sensitivity, and criticality to
the organization.
Implementation guidance
Classifications and associated protective controls for information should take account of business
needs for sharing or restricting information and the business impacts associated with such needs.
Classification guidelines should include conventions for initial classification and reclassification over
time; in accordance with some predetermined access control policy (see 11.1.1).
It should be the responsibility of the asset owner (see 7.1.2) to define the classification of an asset,
periodically review it, and ensure it is kept up to date and at the appropriate level. The classification
should take account of the aggregation effect mentioned in 10.7.2.
Consideration should be given to the number of classification categories and the benefits to be gained
from their use. Overly complex schemes may become cumbersome and uneconomic to use or prove
impractical. Care should be taken in interpreting classification labels on documents from other
organizations, which may have different definitions for the same or similarly named labels.
Other Information
The level of protection can be assessed by analyzing confidentiality, integrity and availability and any
other requirements for the information considered.
Information often ceases to be sensitive or critical after a certain period of time, for example, when the
information has been made public. These aspects should be taken into account, as over-classification
can lead to the implementation of unnecessary controls resulting in additional expense.
Considering documents with similar security requirements together when assigning classification
levels might help to simplify the classification task.
In general, the classification given to information is a shorthand way of determining how this
information is to be handled and protected.

7.2.2

Information labeling and handling

Control
An appropriate set of procedures for information labeling and handling should be developed and
implemented in accordance with the classification scheme adopted by the organization.
Implementation guidance
Procedures for information labeling need to cover information assets in physical and electronic
formats.

21

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Output from systems containing information that is classified as being sensitive or critical should
carry an appropriate classification label (in the output). The labeling should reflect the classification
according to the rules established in 7.2.1. Items for consideration include printed reports, screen
displays, recorded media (e.g. tapes, disks, CDs), electronic messages, and file transfers.
For each classification level, handling procedures including the secure processing, storage,
transmission, declassification, and destruction should be defined. This should also include the
procedures for chain of custody and logging of any security relevant event.
Agreements with other organizations that include information sharing should include procedures to
identify the classification of that information and to interpret the classification labels from other
organizations.
Other Information
Labeling and secure handling of classified information is a key requirement for information sharing
arrangements. Physical labels are a common form of labeling. However, some information assets,
such as documents in electronic form, cannot be physically labeled and electronic means of labeling
need to be used. For example, notification labeling may appear on the screen or display. Where
labeling is not feasible, other means of designating the classification of information may be applied,
e.g. via procedures or meta-data.

Human resources security

8.1

Prior to employment3

Objective: To ensure that employees, contractors and third party users understand their
responsibilities, and are suitable for the roles they are considered for, and to reduce the risk of theft,
fraud or misuse of facilities.
Security responsibilities should be addressed prior to employment in adequate job descriptions and in
terms and conditions of employment.
All candidates for employment, contractors and third party users should be adequately screened,
especially for sensitive jobs.
Employees, contractors and third party users of information processing facilities should sign an
agreement on their security roles and responsibilities.

8.1.1

Roles and responsibilities

Control
Security roles and responsibilities of employees, contractors and third party users should be defined
and documented in accordance with the organization’s information security policy.
Implementation guidance
Security roles and responsibilities should include the requirement to:
a) implement and act in accordance with the organization’s information security policies
(see 5.1);
b) protect assets from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, destruction or
interference;
c) execute particular security processes or activities;
d) ensure responsibility is assigned to the individual for actions taken;
e) report security events or potential events or other security risks to the organization.
Security roles and responsibilities should be defined and clearly communicated to job candidates
during the pre-employment process.
Other Information
Job descriptions can be used to document security roles and responsibilities. Security roles and
responsibilities for individuals not engaged via the organization’s employment process, e.g. engaged
via a third party organization, should also be clearly defined and communicated.

8.1.2

Screening

Control
Background verification checks on all candidates for employment, contractors, and third party users
should be carried out in accordance with relevant laws, regulations and ethics, and proportional to the
business requirements, the classification of the information to be accessed, and the perceived risks.

3

Explanation: The word ’employment’ is meant here to cover all of the following different situations:
employment of people (temporary or longer lasting), appointment of job roles, changing of job roles, assignment
of contracts, and the termination of any of these arrangements.

23

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Implementation guidance
Verification checks should take into account all relevant privacy, protection of personal data and/or
employment based legislation, and should, where permitted, include the following:
a) availability of satisfactory character references, e.g. one business and one personal;
b) a check (for completeness and accuracy) of the applicant’s curriculum vitae;
c) confirmation of claimed academic and professional qualifications;
d) independent identity check (passport or similar document);
e) more detailed checks, such as credit checks or checks of criminal records.
Where a job, either on initial appointment or on promotion, involves the person having access to
information processing facilities, and in particular if these are handling sensitive information, e.g.
financial information or highly confidential information, the organization should also consider further,
more detailed checks.
Procedures should define criteria and limitations for verification checks, e.g. who is eligible to screen
people, and how, when and why verification checks are carried out.
A screening process should also be carried out for contractors, and third party users. Where
contractors are provided through an agency the contract with the agency should clearly specify the
agency’s responsibilities for screening and the notification procedures they need to follow if screening
has not been completed or if the results give cause for doubt or concern. In the same way, the
agreement with the third party (see also 6.2.3) should clearly specify all responsibilities and
notification procedures for screening.
Information on all candidates being considered for positions within the organization should be
collected and handled in accordance with any appropriate legislation existing in the relevant
jurisdiction. Depending on applicable legislation, the candidates should be informed beforehand about
the screening activities.

8.1.3

Terms and conditions of employment

Control
As part of their contractual obligation, employees, contractors and third party users should agree and
sign the terms and conditions of their employment contract, which should state their and the
organization’s responsibilities for information security.
Implementation guidance
The terms and conditions of employment should reflect the organization’s security policy in addition
to clarifying and stating:
a) that all employees, contractors and third party users who are given access to sensitive
information should sign a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement prior to being given
access to information processing facilities;
b) the employee’s, contractor’s and any other user’s legal responsibilities and rights, e.g.
regarding copyright laws or data protection legislation (see also 15.1.1 and 15.1.2);
c) responsibilities for the classification of information and management of organizational
assets associated with information systems and services handled by the employee,
contractor or third party user (see also 7.2.1 and 10.7.3);
d) responsibilities of the employee, contractor or third party user for the handling of
information received from other companies or external parties;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
e) responsibilities of the organization for the handling of personal information, including
personal information created as a result of, or in the course of, employment with the
organization (see also 15.1.4);
f) responsibilities that are extended outside the organization’s premises and outside normal
working hours, e.g. in the case of home-working (see also 9.2.5 and 11.7.1);
g) actions to be taken if the employee, contractor or third party user disregards the
organization’s security requirements (see also 8.2.3).
The organization should ensure that employees, contractors and third party users agree to terms and
conditions concerning information security appropriate to the nature and extent of access they will
have to the organization’s assets associated with information systems and services.
Where appropriate, responsibilities contained within the terms and conditions of employment should
continue for a defined period after the end of the employment (see also 8.3).
Other Information
A code of conduct may be used to cover the employee’s, contractor’s or third party user’s
responsibilities regarding confidentiality, data protection, ethics, appropriate use of the organization’s
equipment and facilities, as well as reputable practices expected by the organization. The contractor
or third party users may be associated with an external organization that may in turn be required to
enter in contractual arrangements on behalf of the contracted individual.

8.2

During employment

Objective: To ensure that employees, contractors and third party users are aware of information
security threats and concerns, their responsibilities and liabilities, and are equipped to support
organizational security policy in the course of their normal work, and to reduce the risk of human
error.
Management responsibilities should be defined to ensure that security is applied throughout an
individual’s employment within the organization.
An adequate level of awareness, education, and training in security procedures and the correct use of
information processing facilities should be provided to all employees, contractors and third party users
to minimize possible security risks. A formal disciplinary process for handling security breaches
should be established.

8.2.1

Management responsibilities

Control
Management should require employees, contractors and third party users to apply security in
accordance with established policies and procedures of the organization.
Implementation guidance
Management responsibilities should include ensuring that employees, contractors and third party
users:
a) are properly briefed on their information security roles and responsibilities prior to being
granted access to sensitive information or information systems;
b) are provided with guidelines to state security expectations of their role within the
organization;
c) are motivated to fulfil the security policies of the organization;

25

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
d) achieve a level of awareness on security relevant to their roles and responsibilities within
the organization (see also 8.2.2);
e) conform to the terms and conditions of employment, which includes the organization’s
information security policy and appropriate methods of working;
f) continue to have the appropriate skills and qualifications.
Other Information
If employees, contractors and third party users are not made aware of their security responsibilities,
they can cause considerable damage to an organization. Motivated personnel are likely to be more
reliable and cause less information security incidents.
Poor management may cause personnel to feel undervalued resulting in a negative security impact to
the organization. For example, poor management may lead to security being neglected or potential
misuse of the organization’s assets.

8.2.2

Information security awareness, education, and training

Control
All employees of the organization and, where relevant, contractors and third party users should
receive appropriate awareness training and regular updates in organizational policies and procedures,
as relevant for their job function.
Implementation guidance
Awareness training should commence with a formal induction process designed to introduce the
organization’s security policies and expectations before access to information or services is granted.
Ongoing training should include security requirements, legal responsibilities and business controls, as
well as training in the correct use of information processing facilities e.g. log-on procedure, use of
software packages and information on the disciplinary process (see 8.2.3).
Other Information
The security awareness, education, and training activities should be suitable and relevant to the
person’s role, responsibilities and skills, and should include information on known threats, who to
contact for further security advice and the proper channels for reporting information security incidents
(see also 13.1).
Training to enhance awareness is intended to allow individuals to recognize information security
problems and incidents, and respond according to the needs of their work role.

8.2.3

Disciplinary process

Control
There should be a formal disciplinary process for employees who have committed a security breach.
Implementation guidance
The disciplinary process should not be commenced without prior verification that a security breach
has occurred (see also 13.2.3 for collection of evidence).
The formal disciplinary process should ensure correct and fair treatment for employees who are
suspected of committing breaches of security. The formal disciplinary process should provide for a
graduated response that takes into consideration factors such as the nature and gravity of the breach
and its impact on business, whether or not this is a first or repeat offence, whether or not the violator
was properly trained, relevant legislation, business contracts and other factors as required. In serious
cases of misconduct the process should allow for instant removal of duties, access rights and
privileges, and for immediate escorting out of the site, if necessary.

Other Information
The disciplinary process should also be used as a deterrent to prevent employees, contractors and third
party users in violating organizational security policies and procedures, and any other security
breaches.

8.3

Termination or change of employment

Objective: To ensure that employees, contractors and third party users exit an organization or change
employment in an orderly manner.
Responsibilities should be in place to ensure an employee’s, contractor’s or third party user’s exit
from the organization is managed, and that the return of all equipment and the removal of all access
rights are completed.
Change of responsibilities and employments within an organization should be managed as the
termination of the respective responsibility or employment in line with this section, and any new
employments should be managed as described in section 8.1.

8.3.1

Termination responsibilities

Control
Responsibilities for performing employment termination or change of employment should be clearly
defined and assigned.
Implementation guidance
The communication of termination responsibilities should include ongoing security requirements and
legal responsibilities and, where appropriate, responsibilities contained within any confidentiality
agreement (see 6.1.5), and the terms and conditions of employment (see 8.1.3) continuing for a
defined period after the end of the employee’s, contractor’s or third party user’s employment.
Responsibilities and duties still valid after termination of employment should be contained in
employee’s, contractor’s or third party user’s contracts.
Changes of responsibility or employment should be managed as the termination of the respective
responsibility or employment, and the new responsibility or employment should be controlled as
described in clause 8.1.
Other Information
The Human Resources function is generally responsible for the overall termination process and works
together with the supervising manager of the person leaving to manage the security aspects of the
relevant procedures. In the case of a contractor, this termination responsibility process may be
undertaken by an agency responsible for the contractor, and in case of an other user this might be
handled by their organization.
It may be necessary to inform employees, customers, contractors, or third party users of changes to
personnel and operating arrangements.

8.3.2

Return of assets

Control
All employees, contractors and third party users should return all of the organization’s assets in their
possession upon termination of their employment, contract or agreement.

27

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Implementation guidance
The termination process should be formalized to include the return of all previously issued software,
corporate documents, and equipment. Other organizational assets such as mobile computing devices,
credit cards, access cards, software, manuals, and information stored on electronic media also need to
be returned.
In cases where an employee, contractor or third party user purchases the organization’s equipment or
uses their own personal equipment, procedures should be followed to ensure that all relevant
information is transferred to the organization and securely erased from the equipment (see also
10.7.1).
In cases where an employee, contractor or third party user has knowledge that is important to ongoing
operations, that information should be documented and transferred to the organization.

8.3.3

Removal of access rights

Control
The access rights of all employees, contractors and third party users to information and information
processing facilities should be removed upon termination of their employment, contract or agreement,
or adjusted upon change.
Implementation guidance
Upon termination, the access rights of an individual to assets associated with information systems and
services should be reconsidered. This will determine whether it is necessary to remove access rights.
Changes of an employment should be reflected in removal of all access rights that were not approved
for the new employment. The access rights that should be removed or adapted include physical and
logical access, keys, identification cards, information processing facilities (see also 11.2.4),
subscriptions, and removal from any documentation that identifies them as a current member of the
organization. If a departing employee, contractor or third party user has known passwords for
accounts remaining active, these should be changed upon termination or change of employment,
contract or agreement.
Access rights for information assets and information processing facilities should be reduced or
removed before the employment terminates or changes, depending on the evaluation of risk factors
such as:
a) whether the termination or change is initiated by the employee, contractor or third party
user, or by management and the reason of termination;
b) the current responsibilities of the employee, contractor or any other user;
c) the value of the assets currently accessible.
Other Information
In certain circumstances access rights may be allocated on the basis of being available to more people
than the departing employee, contractor or third party user, e.g. group IDs. In such circumstances,
departing individuals should be removed from any group access lists and arrangements should be
made to advise all other employees, contractors and third party users involved to no longer share this
information with the person departing.
In cases of management-initiated termination, disgruntled employees, contractors or third party users
may deliberately corrupt information or sabotage information processing facilities. In cases of persons
resigning, they may be tempted to collect information for future use.

Physical and environmental security

9.1

Secure areas

Objective: To prevent unauthorized physical access, damage, and interference to the organization’s
premises and information.
Critical or sensitive information processing facilities should be housed in secure areas, protected by
defined security perimeters, with appropriate security barriers and entry controls. They should be
physically protected from unauthorized access, damage, and interference.
The protection provided should be commensurate with the identified risks.

9.1.1

Physical security perimeter

Control
Security perimeters (barriers such as walls, card controlled entry gates or manned reception desks)
should be used to protect areas that contain information and information processing facilities.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered and implemented where appropriate for physical
security perimeters:
a) security perimeters should be clearly defined, and the siting and strength of each of the
perimeters should depend on the security requirements of the assets within the perimeter
and the results of a risk assessment;
b) perimeters of a building or site containing information processing facilities should be
physically sound (i.e. there should be no gaps in the perimeter or areas where a break-in
could easily occur); the external walls of the site should be of solid construction and all
external doors should be suitably protected against unauthorized access with control
mechanisms, e.g. bars, alarms, locks etc; doors and windows should be locked when
unattended and external protection should be considered for windows, particularly at
ground level;
c) a manned reception area or other means to control physical access to the site or building
should be in place; access to sites and buildings should be restricted to authorized
personnel only;
d) physical barriers should, where applicable, be built to prevent unauthorized physical
access and environmental contamination;
e) all fire doors on a security perimeter should be alarmed, monitored, and tested in
conjunction with the walls to establish the required level of resistance in accordance to
suitable regional, national, and international standards; they should operate in accordance
with local fire code in a failsafe manner;
f) suitable intruder detection systems should be installed to national, regional or
international standards and regularly tested to cover all external doors and accessible
windows; unoccupied areas should be alarmed at all times; cover should also be provided
for other areas, e.g. computer room or communications rooms;
g) information processing facilities managed by the organization should be physically
separated from those managed by third parties.

29

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Other information
Physical protection can be achieved by creating one or more physical barriers around the
organization’s premises and information processing facilities. The use of multiple barriers gives
additional protection, where the failure of a single barrier does not mean that security is immediately
compromised.
A secure area may be a lockable office, or several rooms surrounded by a continuous internal physical
security barrier. Additional barriers and perimeters to control physical access may be needed between
areas with different security requirements inside the security perimeter.
Special consideration towards physical access security should be given to buildings where multiple
organizations are housed.

9.1.2

Physical entry controls

Control
Secure areas should be protected by appropriate entry controls to ensure that only authorized
personnel are allowed access.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered:
a) the date and time of entry and departure of visitors should be recorded, and all visitors
should be supervised unless their access has been previously approved; they should only
be granted access for specific, authorized purposes and should be issued with instructions
on the security requirements of the area and on emergency procedures.
b) access to areas where sensitive information is processed or stored should be controlled
and restricted to authorized persons only; authentication controls, e.g. access control card
plus PIN, should be used to authorize and validate all access; an audit trail of all access
should be securely maintained;
c) all employees, contractors and third party users and all visitors should be required to wear
some form of visible identification and should immediately notify security personnel if
they encounter unescorted visitors and anyone not wearing visible identification;
d) third party support service personnel should be granted restricted access to secure areas or
sensitive information processing facilities only when required; this access should be
authorized and monitored;
e) access rights to secure areas should be regularly reviewed and updated, and revoked when
necessary (see 8.3.3).

9.1.3

Securing offices, rooms, and facilities

Control
Physical security for offices, rooms, and facilities should be designed and applied.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered to secure offices, rooms, and facilities:
a) account should be taken of relevant health and safety regulations and standards;
b) key facilities should be sited to avoid access by the public;
c) where applicable, buildings should be unobtrusive and give minimum indication of their
purpose, with no obvious signs, outside or inside the building identifying the presence of
information processing activities;
d) directories and internal telephone books identifying locations of sensitive information
processing facilities should not be readily accessible by the public.

9.1.4

Protecting against external and environmental threats

Control
Physical protection against damage from fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, civil unrest, and other
forms of natural or man-made disaster should be designed and applied.
Implementation guidance
Consideration should be given to any security threats presented by neighboring premises, e.g. a fire in
a neighbouring building, water leaking from the roof or in floors below ground level or an explosion
in the street.
The following guidelines should be considered to avoid damage from fire, flood, earthquake,
explosion, civil unrest, and other forms of natural or man-made disaster:
a) hazardous or combustible materials should be stored at a safe distance from a secure area.
Bulk supplies such as stationery should not be stored within a secure area;
b) fallback equipment and back-up media should be sited at a safe distance to avoid damage
from a disaster affecting the main site;
c) appropriate fire fighting equipment should be provided and suitably placed.

9.1.5

Working in secure areas

Control
Physical protection and guidelines for working in secure areas should be designed and applied.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered:
a) personnel should only be aware of the existence of, or activities within, a secure area on a
need to know basis;
b) unsupervised working in secure areas should be avoided both for safety reasons and to
prevent opportunities for malicious activities;
c) vacant secure areas should be physically locked and periodically checked;
d) photographic, video, audio or other recording equipment, such as cameras in mobile
devices, should not be allowed, unless authorized;
The arrangements for working in secure areas include controls for the employees, contractors and
third party users working in the secure area, as well as other third party activities taking place there.

9.1.6

Public access, delivery, and loading areas

Control
Access points such as delivery and loading areas and other points where unauthorized persons may
enter the premises should be controlled and, if possible, isolated from information processing facilities
to avoid unauthorized access.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered:
a) access to a delivery and loading area from outside of the building should be restricted to
identified and authorized personnel;
b) the delivery and loading area should be designed so that supplies can be unloaded without
delivery personnel gaining access to other parts of the building;
c) the external doors of a delivery and loading area should be secured when the internal
doors are opened;
d) incoming material should be inspected for potential threats (see 9.2.1d)) before this
material is moved from the delivery and loading area to the point of use;
e) incoming material should be registered in accordance with asset management procedures
(see also 7.1.1) on entry to the site;
f) incoming and outgoing shipments should be physically segregated, where possible.

9.2

Equipment security

Objective: To prevent loss, damage, theft or compromise of assets and interruption to the
organization’s activities.
Equipment should be protected from physical and environmental threats.
Protection of equipment (including that used off-site, and the removal of property) is necessary to
reduce the risk of unauthorized access to information and to protect against loss or damage. This
should also consider equipment siting and disposal. Special controls may be required to protect
against physical threats, and to safeguard supporting facilities, such as the electrical supply and
cabling infrastructure.

9.2.1

Equipment siting and protection

Control
Equipment should be sited or protected to reduce the risks from environmental threats and hazards,
and opportunities for unauthorized access.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered to protect equipment:
a) equipment should be sited to minimize unnecessary access into work areas;
b) information processing facilities handling sensitive data should be positioned and the
viewing angle restricted to reduce the risk of information being viewed by unauthorized
persons during their use, and storage facilities secured to avoid unauthorized access;
c) items requiring special protection should be isolated to reduce the general level of
protection required;
d) controls should be adopted to minimize the risk of potential physical threats, e.g. theft,
fire, explosives, smoke, water (or water supply failure), dust, vibration, chemical effects,
electrical supply interference, communications interference, electromagnetic radiation,
and vandalism;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
e) guidelines for eating, drinking, and smoking in proximity to information processing
facilities should be established;
f) environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, should be monitored for
conditions, which could adversely affect the operation of information processing
facilities;
g) lightning protection should be applied to all buildings and lightning protection filters
should be fitted to all incoming power and communications lines;
h) the use of special protection methods, such as keyboard membranes, should be considered
for equipment in industrial environments;
i)

9.2.2

equipment processing sensitive information should be protected to minimize the risk of
information leakage due to emanation.

Supporting utilities

Control
Equipment should be protected from power failures and other disruptions caused by failures in
supporting utilities.
Implementation guidance
All supporting utilities, such as electricity, water supply, sewage, heating/ventilation, and air
conditioning should be adequate for the systems they are supporting. Support utilities should be
regularly inspected and as appropriate tested to ensure their proper functioning and to reduce any risk
from their malfunction or failure. A suitable electrical supply should be provided that conforms to the
equipment manufacturer’s specifications.
An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to support orderly close down or continuous running is
recommended for equipment supporting critical business operations. Power contingency plans should
cover the action to be taken on failure of the UPS. A back-up generator should be considered if
processing is required to continue in case of a prolonged power failure. An adequate supply of fuel
should be available to ensure that the generator can perform for a prolonged period. UPS equipment
and generators should be regularly checked to ensure it has adequate capacity and is tested in accordance
with the manufacturer’s recommendations. In addition, consideration could be given to using multiple
power sources or, if the site is large, a separate power substation.
Emergency power off switches should be located near emergency exits in equipment rooms to
facilitate rapid power down in case of an emergency. Emergency lighting should be provided in case
of main power failure.
The water supply should be stable and adequate to supply air conditioning, humidification equipment
and fire suppression systems (where used). Malfunctions in the water supply system may damage
equipment or prevent fire suppression from acting effectively. An alarm system to detect malfunctions
in the supporting utilities should be evaluated and installed if required.
Telecommunications equipment should be connected to the utility provider by at least two diverse
routes to prevent failure in one connection path removing voice services. Voice services should be
adequate to meet local legal requirements for emergency communications.
Other information
Options to achieve continuity of power supplies include multiple feeds to avoid a single point of
failure in the power supply.

9.2.3

Cabling security

Control
Power and telecommunications cabling carrying data or supporting information services should be
protected from interception or damage.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines for cabling security should be considered:
a) power and telecommunications lines into information processing facilities should be
underground, where possible, or subject to adequate alternative protection;
b) network cabling should be protected from unauthorized interception or damage, for
example by using a conduit or by avoiding routes through public areas;
c) power cables should be segregated from communications cables to prevent interference;
d) clearly identifiable cable and equipment markings should be used to minimise handling
errors, such as accidental patching of wrong network cables;
e) a documented patch list should be used to reduce the possibility of errors;
f) for sensitive or critical systems further controls to consider include:
1) installation of armoured conduit and locked rooms or boxes at inspection and
termination points;
2) use of alternative routings and/or transmission media providing appropriate security;
3) use of fibre optic cabling;
4) use of electromagnetic shielding to protect the cables;
5) initiation of technical sweeps and physical inspections for unauthorized devices being
attached to the cables;
6) controlled access to patch panels and cable rooms;

9.2.4

Equipment maintenance

Control
Equipment should be correctly maintained to ensure its continued availability and integrity.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines for equipment maintenance should be considered:
a) equipment should be maintained in accordance with the supplier’s recommended service
intervals and specifications;
b) only authorized maintenance personnel should carry out repairs and service equipment;
c) records should be kept of all suspected or actual faults, and all preventive and corrective
maintenance;
d) appropriate controls should be implemented when equipment is scheduled for
maintenance, taking into account whether this maintenance is performed by personnel on
site or external to the organization; where necessary, sensitive information should be
cleared from the equipment, or the maintenance personnel should be sufficiently cleared;
e) all requirements imposed by insurance policies should be complied with.

9.2.5

Security of equipment off-premises

Control
Security should be applied to off-site equipment taking into account the different risks of working
outside the organization’s premises.
Implementation guidance
Regardless of ownership, the use of any information processing equipment outside the organization’s
premises should be authorized by management.
The following guidelines should be considered for the protection of off-site equipment:
a) equipment and media taken off the premises should not be left unattended in public
places; portable computers should be carried as hand luggage and disguised where
possible when travelling;
b) manufacturers’ instructions for protecting equipment should be observed at all times, e.g.
protection against exposure to strong electromagnetic fields;
c) home-working controls should be determined by a risk assessment and suitable controls
applied as appropriate, e.g. lockable filing cabinets, clear desk policy, access controls for
computers and secure communication with the office (see also ISO/IEC 18028 Network
Security);
d) adequate insurance cover should be in place to protect equipment off-site.
Security risks, e.g. of damage, theft or eavesdropping, may vary considerably between locations and
should be taken into account in determining the most appropriate controls.
Other information
Information storing and processing equipment includes all forms of personal computers, organizers,
mobile phones, smart cards, paper or other form, which is held for home working or being transported
away from the normal work location.
More information about other aspects of protecting mobile equipment can be found in 11.7.1.

9.2.6

Secure disposal or re-use of equipment

Control
All items of equipment containing storage media should be checked to ensure that any sensitive data
and licensed software has been removed or securely overwritten prior to disposal.
Implementation guidance
Devices containing sensitive information should be physically destroyed or the information should be
destroyed, deleted or overwritten using techniques to make the original information non-retrievable
rather than using the standard delete or format function.
Other information
Damaged devices containing sensitive data may require a risk assessment to determine whether the
items should be physically destroyed rather than sent for repair or discarded.
Information can be compromised through careless disposal or re-use of equipment (see also 10.7.2).

Removal of property

Control
Equipment, information or software should not be taken off-site without prior authorization.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered:
a) equipment, information or software should not be taken off-site without prior
authorization;
b) employees, contractors and third party users who have authority to permit off-site removal
of assets should be clearly identified;
c) time limits for equipment removal should be set and returns checked for compliance;
d) where necessary and appropriate, equipment should be recorded as being removed off-site
and recorded when returned.
Other information
Spot checks, undertaken to detect unauthorized removal of property, may also be performed to detect
unauthorized recording devices, weapons, etc., and prevent their entry into the site. Such spot checks
should be carried out in accordance with relevant legislation and regulations. Individuals should be
made aware is spot checks are carried out, and the checks should only be performed with
authorization appropriate for the legal and regulatory requirements.

Communications and operations management

10.1

Operational procedures and responsibilities

Objective: To ensure the correct and secure operation of information processing facilities.
Responsibilities and procedures for the management and operation of all information processing
facilities should be established. This includes the development of appropriate operating procedures.
Segregation of duties should be implemented, where appropriate, to reduce the risk of negligent or
deliberate system misuse.

10.1.1 Documented operating procedures
Control
Operating procedures should be documented, maintained, and made available to all users who need
them.
Implementation guidance
Documented procedures should be prepared for system activities associated with information
processing and communication facilities, such as computer start-up and close-down procedures, backup, equipment maintenance, media handling, computer room and mail handling management, and
safety.
The operating procedures should specify the instructions for the detailed execution of each job
including:
a) processing and handling of information;
b) backup (see 10.5);
c) scheduling requirements, including interdependencies with other systems, earliest job start
and latest job completion times;
d) instructions for handling errors or other exceptional conditions, which might arise during
job execution, including restrictions on the use of system utilities (see 11.5.4);
e) support contacts in the event of unexpected operational or technical difficulties;
f) special output and media handling instructions, such as the use of special stationery or the
management of confidential output including procedures for secure disposal of output
from failed jobs (see 10.7.2 and 10.7.3);
g) system restart and recovery procedures for use in the event of system failure;
h) the management of audit-trail and system log information (see 10.10).
Operating procedures, and the documented procedures for system activities, should be treated as
formal documents and changes authorized by management. Where technically feasible, information
systems should be managed consistently, using the same procedures, tools, and utilities.

10.1.2 Change management
Control
Changes to information processing facilities and systems should be controlled.
Implementation guidance
Operational systems and application software should be subject to strict change management control.

37

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
In particular, the following items should be considered:
a) identification and recording of significant changes;
b) planning and testing of changes;
c) assessment of the potential impacts, including security impacts, of such changes;
d) formal approval procedure for proposed changes;
e) communication of change details to all relevant persons;
f) fallback procedures, including procedures and responsibilities for aborting and recovering
from unsuccessful changes and unforeseen events.
Formal management responsibilities and procedures should be in place to ensure satisfactory control
of all changes to equipment, software or procedures. When changes are made, an audit log containing
all relevant information should be retained.
Other information
Inadequate control of changes to information processing facilities and systems is a common cause of
system or security failures. Changes to the operational environment, especially when transferring a
system from development to operational stage, can impact on the reliability of applications (see also
12.5.1).
Changes to operational systems should only be made when there is a valid business reason to do so,
such as an increase in the risk to the system. Updating systems with the latest versions of operating
system or application is not always in the business interest as this could introduce more vulnerabilities
and instability than the current version. There may also be a need for additional training, license costs,
support, maintenance and administration overhead, and new hardware especially during migration.

10.1.3 Segregation of duties
Control
Duties and areas of responsibility should be segregated to reduce opportunities for unauthorized or
unintentional modification or misuse of the organization’s assets.
Implementation guidance
Segregation of duties is a method for reducing the risk of accidental or deliberate system misuse. Care
should be taken that no single person can access, modify or use assets without authorization or
detection. The initiation of an event should be separated from its authorization. The possibility of
collusion should be considered in designing the controls.
Small organizations may find segregation of duties difficult to achieve, but the principle should be
applied as far as is possible and practicable. Whenever it is difficult to segregate, other controls such
as monitoring of activities, audit trails and management supervision should be considered. It is
important that security audit remains independent.

10.1.4 Separation of development, test, and operational facilities
Control
Development, test, and operational facilities should be separated to reduce the risks of unauthorised
access or changes to the operational system.
Implementation guidance
The level of separation between operational, test, and development environments that is necessary to
prevent operational problems should be identified and appropriate controls implemented.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
The following items should be considered:
a) rules for the transfer of software from development to operational status should be defined
and documented;
b) development and operational software should run on different systems or computer
processors and in different domains or directories;
c) compilers, editors, and other development tools or system utilities should not be
accessible from operational systems when not required;
d) the test system environment should emulate the operational system environment as
closely as possible;
e) users should use different user profiles for operational and test systems, and menus should
display appropriate identification messages to reduce the risk of error;
f) sensitive data should not be copied into the test system environment (see 12.4.2).
Other information
Development and test activities can cause serious problems, e.g. unwanted modification of files or
system environment, or system failure. In this case, there is a need to maintain a known and stable
environment in which to perform meaningful testing and to prevent inappropriate developer access.
Where development and test personnel have access to the operational system and its information, they
may be able to introduce unauthorized and untested code or alter operational data. On some systems
this capability could be misused to commit fraud, or introduce untested or malicious code, which can
cause serious operational problems.
Developers and testers also pose a threat to the confidentiality of operational information.
Development and testing activities may cause unintended changes to software or information if they
share the same computing environment. Separating development, test, and operational facilities is
therefore desirable to reduce the risk of accidental change or unauthorized access to operational
software and business data (see also 12.4.2 for the protection of test data).

10.2

Third party service delivery management

Objective: To implement and maintain the appropriate level of information security and service
delivery in line with third party service delivery agreements.
The organization should check the implementation of agreements, monitor compliance with the
agreements and manage changes to ensure that the services delivered meet all requirements agreed
with the third party.

10.2.1 Service delivery
Control
It should be ensured that the security controls, service definitions and delivery levels included in the
third party service delivery agreement are implemented, operated, and maintained by the third party.
Implementation guidance
Service delivery by a third party should include the agreed security arrangements, service definitions,
and aspects of service management. In case of outsourcing arrangements, the organization should plan
the necessary transitions (of information, information processing facilities, and anything else that
needs to be moved), and should ensure that security is maintained throughout the transition period.
The organization should ensure that the third party maintains sufficient service capability together
with workable plans designed to ensure that agreed service continuity levels are maintained following
major service failures or disaster (see 14.1).

10.2.2 Monitoring and review of third party services
Control
The services, reports and records provided by the third party should be regularly monitored and
reviewed, and audits should be carried out regularly.
Implementation guidance
Monitoring and review of third party services should ensure that the information security terms and
conditions of the agreements are being adhered to, and that information security incidents and
problems are managed properly. This should involve a service management relationship and process
between the organization and the third party to:
a) monitor service performance levels to check adherence to the agreements;
b) review service reports produced by the third party and arrange regular progress meetings
as required by the agreements;
c) provide information about information security incidents and review of this information
by the third party and the organization as required by the agreements and any supporting
guidelines and procedures;
d) review third party audit trails and records of security events, operational problems,
failures, tracing of faults and disruptions related to the service delivered;
e) resolve and manage any identified problems.
The responsibility for managing the relationship with a third party should be assigned to a designated
individual or service management team. In addition, the organization should ensure that the third
party assigns responsibilities for checking for compliance and enforcing the requirements of the
agreements. Sufficient technical skills and resources should be made available to monitor that
requirements of the agreement (see 6.2.3), in particular the information security requirements, are
being met. Appropriate action should be taken when deficiencies in the service delivery are observed.
The organization should maintain sufficient overall control and visibility into all security aspects for
sensitive or critical information or information processing facilities accessed, processed or managed
by a third party. The organization should ensure they retain visibility into security activities such as
change management, identification of vulnerabilities, and information security incident
reporting/response through a clearly defined reporting process, format and structure.
Other information
In case of outsourcing, the organization needs to be aware that the ultimate responsibility for
information processed by an outsourcing party remains with the organization.

10.2.3 Managing changes to third party services
Control
Changes to the provision of services, including maintaining and improving existing information
security policies, procedures and controls, should be managed, taking account of the criticality of
business systems and processes involved and re-assessment of risks.

The operational requirements of new systems should be established, documented, and tested prior to
their acceptance and use.

10.3.1 Capacity management
Control
The use of resources should be monitored, tuned, and projections made of future capacity
requirements to ensure the required system performance.
Implementation guidance
For each new and ongoing activity, capacity requirements should be identified. System tuning and
monitoring should be applied to ensure and, where necessary, improve the availability and efficiency
of systems. Detective controls should be put in place to indicate problems in due time. Projections of
future capacity requirements should take account of new business and system requirements and
current and projected trends in the organization's information processing capabilities.
Particular attention needs to be paid to any resources with long procurement lead times or high costs;
therefore managers should monitor the utilization of key system resources. They should identify
trends in usage, particularly in relation to business applications or management information system
tools.
Managers should use this information to identify and avoid potential bottlenecks and dependence on
key personnel that might present a threat to system security or services, and plan appropriate action.

c) conducting regular reviews of the software and data content of systems supporting critical
business processes; the presence of any unapproved files or unauthorized amendments
should be formally investigated;
d) installation and regular update of malicious code detection and repair software to scan
computers and media as a precautionary control, or on a routine basis; the checks carried
out should include:
1) checking any files on electronic or optical media, and files received over networks,
for malicious code before use;
2) checking electronic mail attachments and downloads for malicious code before use;
this check should be carried out at different places, e.g. at electronic mail servers,
desk top computers and when entering the network of the organization;
3) checking web pages for malicious code;
e) defining management procedures and responsibilities to deal with malicious code
protection on systems, training in their use, reporting and recovering from malicious code
attacks (see 13.1 and 13.2);
f) preparing appropriate business continuity plans for recovering from malicious code
attacks, including all necessary data and software back-up and recovery arrangements (see
clause 14);
g) implementing procedures to regularly collect information, such as subscribing to mailing
lists and/or checking web sites giving information about new malicious code;
h) implementing procedures to verify information relating to malicious code, and ensure that
warning bulletins are accurate and informative; managers should ensure that qualified
sources, e.g. reputable journals, reliable Internet sites or suppliers producing software
protecting against malicious code, are used to differentiate between hoaxes and real
malicious code; all users should be made aware of the problem of hoaxes and what to do
on receipt of them.
Other information
The use of two or more software products protecting against malicious code across the information
processing environment from different vendors can improve the effectiveness of malicious code
protection.
Software to protect against malicious code can be installed to provide automatic updates of definition
files and scanning engines to ensure the protection is up to date. In addition, this software can be
installed on every desktop to carry out automatic checks.
Care should be taken to protect against the introduction of malicious code during maintenance and
emergency procedures, which may bypass normal malicious code protection controls.

10.4.2 Controls against mobile code
Control
Where the use of mobile code is authorized, the configuration should ensure that the authorised
mobile code operates according to a clearly defined security policy, and unauthorized mobile code
should be prevented from executing.

Control
Back-up copies of information and software should be taken and tested regularly in accordance with
the agreed backup policy.
Implementation guidance
Adequate back-up facilities should be provided to ensure that all essential information and software
can be recovered following a disaster or media failure.
The following items for information back up should be considered:
a) the necessary level of back-up information should be defined;
b) accurate and complete records of the back-up copies and documented restoration
procedures should be produced;
c) the extent (e.g. full or differential backup) and frequency of backups should reflect the
business requirements of the organization, the security requirements of the information
involved, and the criticality of the information to the continued operation of the
organization;
d) the back-ups should be stored in a remote location, at a sufficient distance to escape any
damage from a disaster at the main site;

Implementation guidance
Consideration given to the security and business implications of interconnecting such facilities should
include:
a) known vulnerabilities in the administrative and accounting systems where information is
shared between different parts of the organization;
b) vulnerabilities of information in business communication systems, e.g. recording phone
calls or conference calls, confidentiality of calls, storage of facsimiles, opening mail,
distribution of mail;
c) policy and appropriate controls to manage information sharing;
d) excluding categories of sensitive business information and classified documents if the
system does not provide an appropriate level of protection (see 7.2);
e) restricting access to diary information relating to selected individuals, e.g. personnel
working on sensitive projects;
f) categories of personnel, contractors or business partners allowed to use the system and the
locations from which it may be accessed (see 6.2 and 6.3);
g) restricting selected facilities to specific categories of user;
h) identifying the status of users, e.g. employees of the organization or contractors in
directories for the benefit of other users;
i)

retention and back-up of information held on the system (see 10.5.1);

j)

fallback requirements and arrangements (see 14).

10.9

Electronic commerce services

Objective: To ensure the security of electronic commerce services, and their secure use.
The security implications associated with using electronic commerce services, including on-line
transactions, and the requirements for controls, should be considered. The integrity and availability of
information electronically published through publicly available systems should also be considered.

10.9.1 Electronic commerce
Control
Information involved in electronic commerce passing over public networks should be protected from
fraudulent activity, contract dispute, and unauthorized disclosure and modification.
Implementation guidance
Security considerations for electronic commerce should include the following:
a) the level of confidence each party requires in each others claimed identity, e.g. through
authentication;
b) authorization processes associated with who may set prices, issue or sign key trading
documents;
c) ensuring that trading partners are fully informed of their authorisations;
d) determining and meeting requirements for confidentiality, integrity, proof of dispatch and
receipt of key documents, and the non-repudiation of contracts, e.g. associated with
tendering and contract processes;
e) the level of trust required in the integrity of advertised price lists;
f) the confidentiality of any sensitive data or information;
g) the confidentiality and integrity of any order transactions, payment information, delivery
address details, and confirmation of receipts;
h) the degree of verification appropriate to check payment information supplied by a
customer;
i)

selecting the most appropriate settlement form of payment to guard against fraud;

j)

the level of protection required to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of order
information;

k) avoidance of loss or duplication of transaction information;
l)

liability associated with any fraudulent transactions;

m) insurance requirements.
Many of the above considerations can be addressed by the application of cryptographic controls (see
12.3), taking into account compliance with legal requirements (see 15.1, especially 15.1.6 for
cryptography legislation).
Electronic commerce arrangements between trading partners should be supported by a documented
agreement which commits both parties to the agreed terms of trading, including details of
authorization (see b) above). Other agreements with information service and value added network
providers may be necessary.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Public trading systems should publicize their terms of business to customers.
Consideration should be given to the resilience to attack of the host(s) used for electronic commerce,
and the security implications of any network interconnection required for the implementation of
electronic commerce services (see 11.4.6).
Other Information
Electronic commerce is vulnerable to a number of network threats that may result in fraudulent
activity, contract dispute, and disclosure or modification of information.
Electronic commerce can make use of secure authentication methods, e.g. using public key
cryptography and digital signatures (see also 12.3) to reduce the risks. Also, trusted third parties can
be used, where such services are needed.

10.9.2 On-Line Transactions
Control
Information involved in on-line transactions should be protected to prevent incomplete transmission,
mis-routing, unauthorized message alteration, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized message
duplication or replay.
Implementation guidance
Security considerations for on-line transactions should include the following:
a) the use of electronic signatures by each of the parties involved in the transaction;
b) all aspects of the transaction, i.e. ensuring that:
1) user credentials of all parties are valid and verified;
2) the transaction remains confidential; and
3) privacy associated with all parties involved is retained;
c) communications path between all involved parties is encrypted;
d) protocols used to communicate between all involved parties is secured;
e) ensuring that the storage of the transaction details are located outside of any public
accessible environment, e.g. on a storage platform existing on the organizational Intranet,
and not retained and exposed on a storage medium directly accessible from the Internet;
f) where a trusted authority is used (e.g. for the purposes of issuing and maintaining digital
signatures and/or digital certificates) security is integrated and embedded throughout the
entire end-to-end certificate/signature management process.
Other Information
The extent of the controls adopted will need to be commensurate with the level of the risk associated
with each form of on-line transaction.
Transactions may need to comply with laws, rules, and regulations in the jurisdiction in which the
transaction is generated from, processed via, completed at, and/or stored.
There exist many forms of transactions that can be performed in an on-line manner e.g. contractual,
financial etc.

10.9.3 Publicly available information
Control
The integrity of information being made available on a publicly available system should be protected
to prevent unauthorized modification.
Implementation guidance
Software, data, and other information requiring a high level of integrity, being made available on a
publicly available system, should be protected by appropriate mechanisms, e.g. digital signatures (see
12.3). The publicly accessible system should be tested against weaknesses and failures prior to
information being made available.
There should be a formal approval process before information is made publicly available. In addition,
all input provided from the outside to the system should be verified and approved.
Electronic publishing systems, especially those that permit feedback and direct entering of
information, should be carefully controlled so that:
a) information is obtained in compliance with any data protection legislation (see 15.1.4);
b) information input to, and processed by, the publishing system will be processed
completely and accurately in a timely manner;
c) sensitive information will be protected during collection, processing, and storage;
d) access to the publishing system does not allow unintended access to networks to which
the system is connected.
Other Information
Information on a publicly available system, e.g. information on a Web server accessible via the
Internet, may need to comply with laws, rules, and regulations in the jurisdiction in which the system
is located, where trade is taking place or where the owner(s) reside. Unauthorized modification of
published information may harm the reputation of the publishing organization.

10.10 Monitoring
Objective: To detect unauthorized information processing activities.
Systems should be monitored and information security events should be recorded. Operator logs and
fault logging should be used to ensure information system problems are identified.
An organization should comply with all relevant legal requirements applicable to its monitoring and
logging activities.
System monitoring should be used to check the effectiveness of controls adopted and to verify
conformity to an access policy model.

10.10.1 Audit logging
Control
Audit logs recording user activities, exceptions, and information security events should be produced
and kept for an agreed period to assist in future investigations and access control monitoring.
Implementation guidance
Audit logs should include, when relevant:
a) user IDs;
b) dates, times, and details of key events, e.g. log-on and log-off;

55

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
c) terminal identity or location if possible;
d) records of successful and rejected system access attempts;
e) records of successful and rejected data and other resource access attempts;
f) changes to system configuration;
g) use of privileges;
h) use of system utilities and applications;
i)

files accessed and the kind of access;

j)

network addresses and protocols;

k) alarms raised by the access control system;
l)

activation and de-activation of protection systems, such as anti-virus systems and
intrusion detection systems.

Other information
The audit logs may contain intrusive and confidential personal data. Appropriate privacy protection
measures should be taken (see also 15.1.4). Where possible, system administrators should not have
permission to erase or de-activate logs of their own activities (see 10.1.3).

10.10.2 Monitoring system use
Control
Procedures for monitoring use of information processing facilities should be established and the
results of the monitoring activities reviewed regularly.
Implementation guidance
The level of monitoring required for individual facilities should be determined by a risk assessment.
An organisation should comply with all relevant legal requirements applicable to its monitoring
activities. Areas that should be considered include:
a) authorized access, including detail such as:
1) the user ID;
2) the date and time of key events;
3) the types of events;
4) the files accessed;
5) the program/utilities used;
b) all privileged operations, such as:
1) use of privileged accounts, e.g. supervisor, root, administrator;
2) system start-up and stop;
3) I/O device attachment/detachment;
c) unauthorized access attempts, such as:
1) failed or rejected user actions;
2) failed or rejected actions involving data and other resources;
3) access policy violations and notifications for network gateways and firewalls;
4) alerts from proprietary intrusion detection systems;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
d) system alerts or failures such as:
1) console alerts or messages;
2) system log exceptions;
3) network management alarms;
4) alarms raised by the access control system;
e) changes to, or attempts to change, system security settings and controls.
How often the results of monitoring activities are reviewed should depend on the risks involved. Risk
factors that should be considered include the:
a) criticality of the application processes;
b) value, sensitivity, and criticality of the information involved;
c) past experience of system infiltration and misuse, and the frequency of vulnerabilities
being exploited;
d) extent of system interconnection (particularly public networks);
e) logging facility being de-activated.
Other information
Usage monitoring procedures are necessary to ensure that users are only performing activities that
have been explicitly authorized.
A log review involves understanding the threats faced by the system and the manner in which these
may arise. Examples of events that might require further investigation in case of information security
incidents are given in 13.1.1.

10.10.3 Protection of log information
Control
Logging facilities and log information should be protected against tampering and unauthorized access.
Implementation guidance
Controls should aim to protect against unauthorized changes and operational problems with the
logging facility including:
a) alterations to the message types that are recorded;
b) log files being edited or deleted;
c) storage capacity of the log file media being exceeded, resulting in either the failure to
record events or over-writing of past recorded events.
Some audit logs may be required to be archived as part of the record retention policy or because of
requirements to collect and retain evidence (see also 13.2.3).
Other information
System logs often contain a large volume of information, much of which is extraneous to security
monitoring. To help identify significant events for security monitoring purposes, the copying of
appropriate message types automatically to a second log, and/or the use of suitable system utilities or
audit tools to perform file interrogation and rationalization should be considered.
System logs need to be protected, because if the data can be modified or data in them deleted, their
existence may create a false sense of security.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)

10.10.4 Administrator and operator logs
Control
System administrator and system operator activities should be logged.
Implementation guidance
Logs should include:
a) the time at which an event (success or failure) occurred;
b) information about the event (e.g. files handled) or failure (e.g. error occurred and
corrective action taken);
c) which account and which administrator or operator was involved;
d) which processes were involved.
System administrator and operator logs should be reviewed on a regular basis.
Other information
An intrusion detection system managed outside of the control of system and network administrators
can be used to monitor system and network administration activities for compliance.

10.10.5 Fault logging
Control
Faults should be logged, analysed, and appropriate action taken.
Implementation guidance
Faults reported by users or by system programs related to problems with information processing or
communications systems should be logged. There should be clear rules for handling reported faults
including:
a) review of fault logs to ensure that faults have been satisfactorily resolved;
b) review of corrective measures to ensure that controls have not been compromised, and
that the action taken is fully authorized.
It should be ensured that error logging is enabled, if this system function is available.
Other information
Logging of errors and faults can impact the performance of a system. Such logging should be enabled
by competent personnel, and the level of logging required for individual systems should be
determined by a risk assessment, taking performance degradation into account.

10.10.6 Clock synchronization
Control
The clocks of all relevant information processing systems within an organization or security domain
should be synchronized with an agreed accurate time source.
Implementation guidance
Where a computer or communications device has the capability to operate a real-time clock, this clock
should be set to an agreed standard, e.g. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or local standard time. As
some clocks are known to drift with time, there should be a procedure that checks for and corrects any
significant variation.
The correct interpretation of the date/time format is important to ensure that the timestamp reflects the
real date/time. Local specifics (e.g. daylight savings) should be taken into account.

Other information
The correct setting of computer clocks is important to ensure the accuracy of audit logs, which may be
required for investigations or as evidence in legal or disciplinary cases. Inaccurate audit logs may
hinder such investigations and damage the credibility of such evidence. A clock linked to a radio time
broadcast from a national atomic clock can be used as the master clock for logging systems. A
network time protocol can be used to keep all of the servers in synchronisation with the master clock.

Access control

11.1

Business requirement for access control

Objective: To control access to information.
Access to information, information processing facilities, and business processes should be controlled
on the basis of business and security requirements.
Access control rules should take account of policies for information dissemination and authorization.

11.1.1 Access control policy
Control
An access control policy should be established, documented, and reviewed based on business and
security requirements for access.
Implementation guidance
Access control rules and rights for each user or group of users should be clearly stated in an access
control policy. Access controls are both logical and physical (see also section 9) and these should be
considered together. Users and service providers should be given a clear statement of the business
requirements to be met by access controls.
The policy should take account of the following:
a) security requirements of individual business applications;
b) identification of all information related to the business applications and the risks the
information is facing;
c) policies for information dissemination and authorization, e.g. the need to know principle
and security levels and classification of information (see 7.2);
d) consistency between the access control and information classification policies of different
systems and networks;
e) relevant legislation and any contractual obligations regarding protection of access to data
or services (see 15.1);
f) standard user access profiles for common job roles in the organization;
g) management of access rights in a distributed and networked environment which
recognizes all types of connections available;
h) segregation of access control roles, e.g. access request, access authorization, access
administration;
i)

requirements for formal authorization of access requests (see 11.2.1);

j)

requirements for periodic review of access controls (see 11.2.4);

k) removal of access rights (see 8.3.3).
Other information
Care should be taken when specifying access control rules to consider:
a) differentiating between rules that must always be enforced and guidelines that are
optional or conditional;

Licensed to Mr. PEDDINTI

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
b) establishing rules based on the premise “Everything is generally forbidden unless
expressly permitted” rather than the weaker rule “Everything is generally permitted unless
expressly forbidden”;
c) changes in information labels (see 7.2) that are initiated automatically by information
processing facilities and those initiated at the discretion of a user;
d) changes in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the information system and
those initiated by an administrator;
e) rules, which require specific approval before enactment, and those which do not.
Access control rules should be supported by formal procedures and clearly defined responsibilities
(see, for example, 6.1.3, 11.3, 10.4.1, 11.6).

11.2

User access management

Objective: To ensure authorized user access and to prevent unauthorized access to information
systems.
Formal procedures should be in place to control the allocation of access rights to information systems
and services.
The procedures should cover all stages in the life-cycle of user access, from the initial registration of
new users to the final de-registration of users who no longer require access to information systems and
services. Special attention should be given, where appropriate, to the need to control the allocation of
privileged access rights, which allow users to override system controls.

11.2.1 User registration
Control
There should be a formal user registration and de-registration procedure in place for granting and
revoking access to all information systems and services.
Implementation guidance
The access control procedure for user registration and de-registration should include:
a) using unique user IDs to enable users to be linked to and held responsible for their
actions; the use of group IDs should only be permitted where they are necessary for
business or operational reasons, and should be approved and documented;
b) checking that the user has authorization from the system owner for the use of the
information system or service; separate approval for access rights from management may
also be appropriate;
c) checking that the level of access granted is appropriate to the business purpose (see 11.1)
and is consistent with organizational security policy, e.g. it does not compromise
segregation of duties (see 10.1.3);
d) giving users a written statement of their access rights;
e) requiring users to sign statements indicating that they understand the conditions of access;
f) ensuring service providers do not provide access until authorization procedures have been
completed;
g) maintaining a formal record of all persons registered to use the service;
h) immediately removing or blocking access rights of users who have changed roles or jobs
or left the organization;
i)

periodically checking for, and removing or blocking, redundant user IDs and accounts
(see 11.2.4);

j)

ensuring that redundant user IDs are not issued to other users.

61

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Other information
Consideration should be given to establish user access roles based on business requirements that
summarize a number of access rights into typical user access profiles. Access requests and reviews
(see 11.2.4) are easier managed at the level of such roles than at the level of particular rights.
Consideration should be given to including clauses in personnel contracts and service contracts that
specify sanctions if unauthorized access is attempted by personnel or service agents (see also 6.1.5,
8.1.3 and 8.2.3).

11.2.2 Privilege management
Control
The allocation and use of privileges should be restricted and controlled.
Implementation guidance
Multi-user systems that require protection against unauthorized access should have the allocation of
privileges controlled through a formal authorization process. The following steps should be
considered:
a) the access privileges associated with each system product, e.g. operating system, database
management system and each application, and the users to which they need to be
allocated should be identified;
b) privileges should be allocated to users on a need-to-use basis and on an event-by-event
basis in line with the access control policy (11.1.1), i.e. the minimum requirement for
their functional role only when needed;
c) an authorization process and a record of all privileges allocated should be maintained.
Privileges should not be granted until the authorization process is complete;
d) the development and use of system routines should be promoted to avoid the need to grant
privileges to users;
e) the development and use of programs which avoid the need to run with privileges should
be promoted;
f) privileges should be assigned to a different user ID from those used for normal business
use.
Other information
Inappropriate use of system administration privileges (any feature or facility of an information system
that enables the user to override system or application controls) can be a major contributory factor to
the failures or breaches of systems.

11.2.3 User password management
Control
The allocation of passwords should be controlled through a formal management process.
Implementation guidance
The process should include the following requirements:
a) users should be required to sign a statement to keep personal passwords confidential and
to keep group passwords solely within the members of the group; this signed statement
could be included in the terms and conditions of employment (see 8.1.3);

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
b) when users are required to maintain their own passwords they should be provided initially
with a secure temporary password (see 11.3.1), which they are forced to change
immediately;
c) establish procedures to verify the identity of a user prior to providing a new, replacement
or temporary password;
d) temporary passwords should be given to users in a secure manner; the use of third parties
or unprotected (clear text) electronic mail messages should be avoided;
e) temporary passwords should be unique to an individual and should not be guessable;
f) users should acknowledge receipt of passwords;
g) passwords should never be stored on computer systems in an unprotected form;
h) default vendor passwords should be altered following installation of systems or software.
Other information
Passwords are a common means of verifying a user’s identity before access is given to an information
system or service according to the user’s authorization. Other technologies for user identification and
authentication, such as biometrics, e.g. finger-print verification, signature verification, and use of
hardware tokens, e.g. smart cards, are available, and should be considered if appropriate.

11.2.4 Review of user access rights
Control
Management should review users’ access rights at regular intervals using a formal process.
Implementation guidance
The review of access rights should consider the following guidelines:
a) users’ access rights should be reviewed at regular intervals, e.g. a period of 6 months, and
after any changes, such as promotion, demotion, or termination of employment (see
11.2.1);
b) user access rights should be reviewed and re-allocated when moving from one
employment to another within the same organization;
c) authorizations for special privileged access rights (see 11.2.2) should be reviewed at more
frequent intervals, e.g. at a period of 3 months;
d) privilege allocations should be checked at regular intervals to ensure that unauthorized
privileges have not been obtained;
e) changes to privileged accounts should be logged for periodic review.
Other information
It is necessary to regularly review users’ access rights to maintain effective control over access to data
and information services.

11.3

User responsibilities

Objective: To prevent unauthorized user access, and compromise or theft of information and
information processing facilities.
The co-operation of authorized users is essential for effective security.
Users should be made aware of their responsibilities for maintaining effective access controls,
particularly regarding the use of passwords and the security of user equipment.
A clear desk and clear screen policy should be implemented to reduce the risk of unauthorized access
or damage to papers, media, and information processing facilities.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)

11.3.1 Password use
Control
Users should be required to follow good security practices in the selection and use of passwords.
Implementation guidance
All users should be advised to:
a) keep passwords confidential;
b) avoid keeping a record (e.g. paper, software file or hand-held device) of passwords, unless
this can be stored securely and the method of storing has been approved;
c) change passwords whenever there is any indication of possible system or password
compromise;
d) select quality passwords with sufficient minimum length which are:
1) easy to remember;
2) not based on anything somebody else could easily guess or obtain using person
related information, e.g. names, telephone numbers, and dates of birth etc.;
3) not vulnerable to dictionary attacks (i.e. do not consist of words included in
dictionaries);
4) free of consecutive identical, all-numeric or all-alphabetic characters;
e) change passwords at regular intervals or based on the number of accesses (passwords for
privileged accounts should be changed more frequently than normal passwords), and
avoid re-using or cycling old passwords;
f) change temporary passwords at the first log-on;
g) not include passwords in any automated log-on process, e.g. stored in a macro or function
key;
h) not share individual user passwords;
i)

not use the same password for business and non-business purposes.

If users need to access multiple services, systems or platforms, and are required to maintain multiple
separate passwords, they should be advised that they may use a single, quality password (see d)
above) for all services where the user is assured that a reasonable level of protection has been
established for the storage of the password within each service, system or platform.
Other information
Management of the help desk system dealing with lost or forgotten passwords needs special care as
this may also be a means of attack to the password system.

11.3.2 Unattended user equipment
Control
Users should ensure that unattended equipment has appropriate protection.
Implementation guidance
All users should be made aware of the security requirements and procedures for protecting unattended
equipment, as well as their responsibilities for implementing such protection. Users should be advised
to:
a) terminate active sessions when finished, unless they can be secured by an appropriate
locking mechanism, e.g. a password protected screen saver;
b) log-off mainframe computers, servers, and office PCs when the session is finished (i.e.
not just switch off the PC screen or terminal);

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
c) secure PCs or terminals from unauthorized use by a key lock or an equivalent control, e.g.
password access, when not in use (see also 11.3.3).
Other information
Equipment installed in user areas, e.g. workstations or file servers, may require specific protection
from unauthorized access when left unattended for an extended period.

11.3.3 Clear desk and clear screen policy
Control
A clear desk policy for papers and removable storage media and a clear screen policy for information
processing facilities should be adopted.
Implementation guidance
The clear desk and clear screen policy should take into account the information classifications (see
7.2), legal and contractual requirements (see 15.1), and the corresponding risks and cultural aspects of
the organization. The following guidelines should be considered:
a) sensitive or critical business information, e.g. on paper or on electronic storage media,
should be locked away (ideally in a safe or cabinet or other forms of security furniture)
when not required, especially when the office is vacated;
b) computers and terminals should be left logged off or protected with a screen and keyboard
locking mechanism controlled by a password, token or similar user authentication
mechanism when unattended and should be protected by key locks, passwords or other
controls when not in use;
c) incoming and outgoing mail points and unattended facsimile machines should be
protected;
d) unauthorised use of photocopiers and other reproduction technology (e.g., scanners,
digital cameras) should be prevented;
e) documents containing sensitive or classified information should be removed from printers
immediately.
Other information
A clear desk/clear screen policy reduces the risks of unauthorized access, loss of, and damage to
information during and outside normal working hours. Safes or other forms of secure storage
facilities might also protect information stored therein against disasters such as a fire, earthquake,
flood or explosion.
Consider the use of printers with pin code function, so the originators are the only ones who can get
their print outs, and only when standing next to the printer.

11.4

Network access control

Objective: To prevent unauthorized access to networked services.
Access to both internal and external networked services should be controlled.
User access to networks and network services should not compromise the security of the network
services by ensuring:
a) appropriate interfaces are in place between the organization’s network and networks owned by
other organizations, and public networks;
b) appropriate authentication mechanisms are applied for users and equipment;
c) control of user access to information services in enforced.

11.4.1 Policy on use of network services
Control
Users should only be provided with access to the services that they have been specifically authorized
to use.
Implementation guidance
A policy should be formulated concerning the use of networks and network services. This policy
should cover:
a) the networks and network services which are allowed to be accessed;
b) authorization procedures for determining who is allowed to access which networks and
networked services;
c) management controls and procedures to protect access to network connections and
network services;
d) the means used to access networks and network services (e.g. the conditions for allowing
dial-up access to an Internet service provider or remote system).
The policy on the use of network services should be consistent with the business access control policy
(see 11.1).
Other information
Unauthorized and insecure connections to network services can affect the whole organization. This
control is particularly important for network connections to sensitive or critical business applications
or to users in high-risk locations, e.g. public or external areas that are outside the organization’s
security management and control.

11.4.2 User authentication for external connections
Control
Appropriate authentication methods should be used to control access by remote users.
Implementation guidance
Authentication of remote users can be achieved using, for example, a cryptographic based technique,
hardware tokens, or a challenge/response protocol. Possible implementations of such techniques can
be found in various virtual private network (VPN) solutions. Dedicated private lines can also be used
to provide assurance of the source of connections.
Dial-back procedures and controls, e.g. using dial-back modems, can provide protection against
unauthorized and unwanted connections to an organization’s information processing facilities. This
type of control authenticates users trying to establish a connection to an organization’s network from
remote locations. When using this control, an organization should not use network services, which
include call forwarding, or, if they do, they should disable the use of such features to avoid
weaknesses associated with call forwarding. The call back process should ensure that an actual
disconnection on the organization’s side occurs. Otherwise, the remote user could hold the line open
pretending that the call back verification has occurred. Call back procedures and controls should be
thoroughly tested for this possibility.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Node authentication can serve as an alternative means of authenticating groups of remote users where
they are connected to a secure, shared computer facility. Cryptographic techniques, e.g. based on
machine certificates, can be used for node authentication. This is part of several VPN based solutions.
Additional authentication controls should be implemented to control access to wireless networks. In
particular, special care is needed in the selection of controls for wireless networks due to the greater
opportunities for undetected interception and insertion of network traffic.
Other information
External connections provide a potential for unauthorized access to business information, e.g. access
by dial-up methods. There are different types of authentication method, some of these provide a
greater level of protection than others, e.g. methods based on the use of cryptographic techniques can
provide strong authentication. It is important to determine from a risk assessment the level of
protection required. This is needed for the appropriate selection of an authentication method.
A facility for automatic connection to a remote computer could provide a way of gaining unauthorized
access to a business application. This is especially important if the connection uses a network that is
outside the control of the organization’s security management.

11.4.3 Equipment identification in networks
Control
Automatic equipment identification should be considered as a means to authenticate connections from
specific locations and equipment.
Implementation guidance
Equipment identification can be used if it is important that the communication can only be initiated
from a specific location or equipment. An identifier in or attached to, the equipment can be used to
indicate whether this equipment is permitted to connect to the network. These identifiers should
clearly indicate to which network the equipment is permitted to connect, if more than one network
exists and particularly if these networks are of differing sensitivity. It may be necessary to consider
physical protection of the equipment to maintain the security of the equipment identifier.
Other information
This control can be complemented with other techniques to authenticate the equipment’s user (see
11.4.2). Equipment identification can be applied additionally to user authentication.

11.4.4 Remote diagnostic and configuration port protection
Control
Physical and logical access to diagnostic and configuration ports should be controlled.
Implementation guidance
Potential controls for the access to diagnostic and configuration ports include the use of a key lock and
supporting procedures to control physical access to the port. An example for such a supporting
procedure is to ensure that diagnostic and configuration ports are only accessible by arrangement
between the manager of the computer service and the hardware/software support personnel requiring
access.
Ports, services, and similar facilities installed on a computer or network facility, which are not
specifically required for business functionality, should be disabled or removed.
Other information
Many computer systems, network systems, and communication systems are installed with a remote
diagnostic or configuration facility for use by maintenance engineers. If unprotected, these diagnostic
ports provide a means of unauthorized access.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)

11.4.5 Segregation in networks
Control
Groups of information services, users, and information systems should be segregated on networks.
Implementation guidance
One method of controlling the security of large networks is to divide them into separate logical
network domains, e.g. an organization’s internal network domains and external network domains,
each protected by a defined security perimeter. A graduated set of controls can be applied in different
logical network domains to further segregate the network security environments, e.g. publicly
accessible systems, internal networks, and critical assets. The domains should be defined based on a
risk assessment and the different security requirements within each of the domains.
Such a network perimeter can be implemented by installing a secure gateway between the two
networks to be interconnected to control access and information flow between the two domains. This
gateway should be configured to filter traffic between these domains (see 11.4.6 and 11.4.7) and to
block unauthorized access in accordance with the organization’s access control policy (see 11.1). An
example of this type of gateway is what is commonly referred to as a firewall. Another method of
segregating separate logical domains is to restrict network access by using virtual private networks for
user groups within the organization.
Networks can also be segregated using the network device functionality, e.g. IP switching. Separate
domains can then be implemented by controlling the network data flows using the routing/switching
capabilities, such as access control lists.
The criteria for segregation of networks into domains should be based on the access control policy and
access requirements (see 10.1), and also take account of the relative cost and performance impact of
incorporating suitable network routing or gateway technology (see 11.4.6 and 11.4.7).
In addition, segregation of networks should be based on the value and classification of information
stored or processed in the network, levels of trust, or lines of business, in order to reduce the total
impact of a service disruption.
Consideration should be given to the segregation of wireless networks from internal and private
networks. As the perimeters of wireless networks are not well defined, a risk assessment should be
carried out in such cases to identify controls (e.g. strong authentication, cryptographic methods, and
frequency selection) to maintain network segregation.
Other information
Networks are increasingly being extended beyond traditional organizational boundaries, as business
partnerships are formed that may require the interconnection or sharing of information processing and
networking facilities. Such extensions might increase the risk of unauthorized access to existing
information systems that use the network, some of which may require protection from other network
users because of their sensitivity or criticality.

11.4.6 Network connection control
Control
For shared networks, especially those extending across the organization’s boundaries, the capability of
users to connect to the network should be restricted, in line with the access control policy and
requirements of the business applications (see 11.1).
Implementation guidance
The network access rights of users should be maintained and updated as required by the access control
policy (see 11.1.1).

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
The connection capability of users can be restricted through network gateways that filter traffic by
means of pre-defined tables or rules. Examples of applications to which restrictions should be applied
are:
a) messaging, e.g. electronic mail;
b) file transfer;
c) interactive access;
d) application access.
Linking network access rights to certain times of day or dates should be considered.
Other information
The incorporation of controls to restrict the connection capability of the users may be required by the
access control policy for shared networks, especially those extending across organizational boundaries.

11.4.7 Network routing control
Control
Routing controls should be implemented for networks to ensure that computer connections and
information flows do not breach the access control policy of the business applications.
Implementation guidance
Routing controls should be based on positive source and destination address checking mechanisms.
Security gateways can be used to validate source and destination addresses at internal and external
network control points if proxy and/or network address translation technologies are employed.
Implementers should be aware of the strength and shortcomings of any mechanisms deployed. The
requirements for network routing control should be based on the access control policy (see 11.1).
Other information
Shared networks, especially those extending across organizational boundaries, may require additional
routing controls. This particularly applies where networks are shared with third party (nonorganization) users.

11.5

Operating system access control

Objective: To prevent unauthorized access to operating systems.
Security facilities should be used to restrict access to operating systems to authorized users. The
facilities should be capable of the following:
a)

authenticating authorized users, in accordance with a defined access control policy;

b) recording successful and failed system authentication attempts;
c)

recording the use of special system privileges;

d) issuing alarms when system security policies are breached;
e)

providing appropriate means for authentication;

f)

where appropriate, restricting the connection time of users.

11.5.1 Secure log-on procedures
Control
Access to operating systems should be controlled by a secure log-on procedure.

69

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Implementation guidance
The procedure for logging into an operating system should be designed to minimize the opportunity
for unauthorized access. The log-on procedure should therefore disclose the minimum of information
about the system, in order to avoid providing an unauthorized user with any unnecessary assistance. A
good log-on procedure should:
a) not display system or application identifiers until the log-on process has been successfully
completed;
b) display a general notice warning that the computer should only be accessed by authorized
users;
c) not provide help messages during the log-on procedure that would aid an unauthorized
user;
d) validate the log-on information only on completion of all input data. If an error condition
arises, the system should not indicate which part of the data is correct or incorrect;
e) limit the number of unsuccessful log-on attempts allowed, e.g. to three attempts, and
consider:
1) recording unsuccessful and successful attempts;
2) forcing a time delay before further log-on attempts are allowed or rejecting any
further attempts without specific authorization;
3) disconnecting data link connections;
4) sending an alarm message to the system console if the maximum number of log-on
attempts is reached;
5) setting the number of password retries in conjunction with the minimum length of the
password and the value of the system being protected;
f) limit the maximum and minimum time allowed for the log-on procedure. If exceeded, the
system should terminate the log-on;
g) display the following information on completion of a successful log-on:
1) date and time of the previous successful log-on;
2) details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts since the last successful log-on;
h) not display the password being entered or consider hiding the password characters by
symbols;
i)

not transmit passwords in clear text over a network.

Other information
If passwords are transmitted in clear text during the log-on session over a network, they may be
captured by a network ‘sniffer’ program on the network.

11.5.2 User identification and authentication
Control
All users should have a unique identifier (user ID) for their personal use only, and a suitable
authentication technique should be chosen to substantiate the claimed identity of a user.
Implementation guidance
This control should be applied for all types of users (including technical support personnel, operators,
network administrators, system programmers, and database administrators).

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
User IDs should be used to trace activities to the responsible individual. Regular user activities should
not be performed from privileged accounts.
In exceptional circumstances, where there is a clear business benefit, the use of a shared user ID for a
group of users or a specific job can be used. Approval by management should be documented for such
cases. Additional controls may be required to maintain accountability.
Generic IDs for use by an individual should only be allowed either where the functions accessible or
actions carried out by the ID do not need to be traced (e.g. read only access), or where there are other
controls in place (e.g. password for a generic ID only issued to one staff at a time and logging such
instance).
Where strong authentication and identity verification is required, authentication methods alternative to
passwords, such as cryptographic means, smart cards, tokens or biometric means, should be used.
Other information
Passwords (see also 11.3.1 and 11.5.3) are a very common way to provide identification and
authentication based on a secret that only the user knows. The same can also be achieved with
cryptographic means and authentication protocols. The strength of user identification and
authentication should be suitable to the sensitivity of the information to be accessed.
Objects such as memory tokens or smart cards that users possess can also be used for identification
and authentication. Biometric authentication technologies that use the unique characteristics or
attributes of an individual can also be used to authenticate the person’s identity. A combination of
technologies and mechanisms securely linked will result in stronger authentication.

11.5.3 Password management system
Control
Systems for managing passwords should be interactive and should ensure quality passwords.
Implementation guidance
A password management system should:
a) enforce the use of individual user IDs and passwords to maintain accountability;
b) allow users to select and change their own passwords and include a confirmation
procedure to allow for input errors;
c) enforce a choice of quality passwords (see 11.3.1);
d) enforce password changes (see 11.3.1);
e) force users to change temporary passwords at the first log-on (see 11.2.3);
f) maintain a record of previous user passwords and prevent re-use;
g) not display passwords on the screen when being entered;
h) store password files separately from application system data;
i)

store and transmit passwords in protected (e.g. encrypted or hashed) form.

Other information
Passwords are one of the principal means of validating a user’s authority to access a computer service.
Some applications require user passwords to be assigned by an independent authority; in such cases,
points b), d) and e) of the above guidance do not apply. In most cases the passwords are selected and
maintained by users. See section 11.3.1 for guidance on the use of passwords.

11.5.4 Use of system utilities
Control
The use of utility programs that might be capable of overriding system and application controls should
be restricted and tightly controlled.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines for the use of system utilities should be considered:
a) use of identification, authentication, and authorization procedures for system utilities;
b) segregation of system utilities from applications software;
c) limitation of the use of system utilities to the minimum practical number of trusted,
authorized users (see also 11.2.2);
d) authorization for ad hoc use of systems utilities;
e) limitation of the availability of system utilities, e.g. for the duration of an authorized
change;
f) logging of all use of system utilities;
g) defining and documenting of authorization levels for system utilities;
h) removal or disabling of all unnecessary software based utilities and system software;
i)

not making system utilities available to users who have access to applications on systems
where segregation of duties is required.

Other information
Most computer installations have one or more system utility programs that might be capable of
overriding system and application controls.

11.5.5 Session time-out
Control
Inactive sessions should shut down after a defined period of inactivity.
Implementation guidance
A time-out facility should clear the session screen and also, possibly later, close both application and
network sessions after a defined period of inactivity. The time-out delay should reflect the security
risks of the area, the classification of the information being handled and the applications being used,
and the risks related to the users of the equipment.
A limited form of time-out facility can be provided for some systems, which clears the screen and
prevents unauthorized access but does not close down the application or network sessions.
Other information
This control is particularly important in high risk locations, which include public or external areas
outside the organization's security management. The sessions should be shut down to prevent access
by unauthorized persons and denial of service attacks.

11.5.6 Limitation of connection time
Control
Restrictions on connection times should be used to provide additional security for high-risk
applications.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Implementation guidance
Connection time controls should be considered for sensitive computer applications, especially from
high risk locations, e.g. public or external areas that are outside the organization’s security
management. Examples of such restrictions include:
a) using predetermined time slots, e.g. for batch file transmissions, or regular interactive
sessions of short duration;
b) restricting connection times to normal office hours if there is no requirement for overtime
or extended-hours operation;
c) considering re-authentication at timed intervals.
Other information
Limiting the period during which connections to computer services are allowed reduces the window of
opportunity for unauthorized access. Limiting the duration of active sessions prevents users from
holding sessions open to prevent re-authenticating.

11.6

Application and information access control

Objective: To prevent unauthorized access to information held in application systems.
Security facilities should be used to restrict access to and within application systems.
Logical access to application software and information should be restricted to authorized users.
Application systems should:
a)

control user access to information and application system functions, in accordance with a defined
access control policy;

b) provide protection from unauthorized access by any utility, operating system software, and
malicious software that is capable of overriding or bypassing system or application controls;
c)

not compromise other systems with which information resources are shared.

11.6.1 Information access restriction
Control
Access to information and application system functions by users and support personnel should be
restricted in accordance with the defined access control policy.
Implementation guidance
Restrictions to access should be based on individual business application requirements. The access
control policy should also be consistent with the organizational access policy (see section 11.1).
Applying the following guidelines should be considered in order to support access restriction
requirements:
a) providing menus to control access to application system functions;
b) controlling the access rights of users, e.g. read, write, delete, and execute;
c) controlling access rights of other applications;
d) ensuring that outputs from application systems handling sensitive information contain
only the information relevant to the use of the output and are sent only to authorized
terminals and locations; this should include periodic reviews of such outputs to ensure
that redundant information is removed.

11.6.2 Sensitive system isolation
Control
Sensitive systems should have a dedicated (isolated) computing environment.
Implementation guidance
The following points should be considered for sensitive system isolation:
a) the sensitivity of an application system should be explicitly identified and documented by
the application owner (see 7.1.2);
b) when a sensitive application is to run in a shared environment, the application systems
with which it will share resources and the corresponding risks should be identified and
accepted by the owner of the sensitive application.
Other information
Some application systems are sufficiently sensitive to potential loss that they require special handling.
The sensitivity may indicate that the application system:
a) should run on a dedicated computer; or
b) should only share resources with trusted applications systems.
Isolation could be achieved using physical or logical methods (see also 11.4.5).

11.7

Mobile computing and teleworking

Objective: To ensure information security when using mobile computing and teleworking facilities.
The protection required should be commensurate with the risks these specific ways of working cause.
When using mobile computing the risks of working in an unprotected environment should be
considered and appropriate protection applied. In the case of teleworking the organization should
apply protection to the teleworking site and ensure that suitable arrangements are in place for this way
of working.

11.7.1 Mobile computing and communications
Control
A formal policy should be in place, and appropriate security measures should be adopted to protect
against the risks of using mobile computing and communication facilities.
Implementation guidance
When using mobile computing and communicating facilities, e.g. notebooks, palmtops, laptops, smart
cards, and mobile phones, special care should be taken to ensure that business information is not
compromised. The mobile computing policy should take into account the risks of working with
mobile computing equipment in unprotected environments.
The mobile computing policy should include the requirements for physical protection, access controls,
cryptographic techniques, back-ups, and virus protection. This policy should also include rules and
advice on connecting mobile facilities to networks and guidance on the use of these facilities in public
places.
Care should be taken when using mobile computing facilities in public places, meeting rooms and
other unprotected areas outside of the organization’s premises. Protection should be in place to avoid
the unauthorized access to or disclosure of the information stored and processed by these facilities, e.g.
using cryptographic techniques (see 12.3).
Users of mobile computing facilities in public places should take care to avoid the risk of overlooking
by unauthorized persons. Procedures against malicious software should be in place and be kept up to
date (see 10.4).

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Back-ups of critical business information should be taken regularly. Equipment should be available to
enable the quick and easy back-up of information. These back-ups should be given adequate
protection against, e.g., theft or loss of information.
Suitable protection should be given to the use of mobile facilities connected to networks. Remote
access to business information across public network using mobile computing facilities should only
take place after successful identification and authentication, and with suitable access control
mechanisms in place (see 11.4).
Mobile computing facilities should also be physically protected against theft especially when left, for
example, in cars and other forms of transport, hotel rooms, conference centres, and meeting places. A
specific procedure taking into account legal, insurance and other security requirements of the
organization should be established for cases of theft or loss of the mobile computing facilities.
Equipment carrying important, sensitive, and/or critical business information should not be left
unattended and, where possible, should be physically locked away, or special locks should be used to
secure the equipment (see 9.2.5).
Training should be arranged for personnel using mobile computing to raise their awareness on the
additional risks resulting from this way of working and the controls that should be implemented.
Other information
Mobile network wireless connections are similar to other types of network connection, but have
important differences that should be considered when identifying controls. Typical differences are
a) some wireless security protocols are immature and have known weaknesses;
b) information stored on mobile computers may not be backed-up because of limited network
bandwidth and/or because mobile equipment may not be connected at the times when back-ups
are scheduled.

11.7.2 Teleworking
Control
A policy, operational plans and procedures should be developed and implemented for teleworking
activities.
Implementation guidance
Organizations should only authorize teleworking activities if they are satisfied that appropriate
security arrangements and controls are in place, and that these comply with the organization’s security
policy.
Suitable protection of the teleworking site should be in place against, e.g., the theft of equipment and
information, the unauthorized disclosure of information, unauthorized remote access to the
organization’s internal systems or misuse of facilities. Teleworking activities should both be
authorized and controlled by management, and it should be ensured that suitable arrangements are in
place for this way of working.
The following matters should be considered:
a) the existing physical security of the teleworking site, taking into account the physical
security of the building and the local environment;
b) the proposed physical teleworking environment;
c) the communications security requirements, taking into account the need for remote access
to the organization’s internal systems, the sensitivity of the information that will be
accessed and pass over the communication link and the sensitivity of the internal system;

d) the threat of unauthorized access to information or resources from other persons using the
accommodation, e.g. family and friends;
e) the use of home networks and requirements or restrictions on the configuration of wireless
network services;
f) policies and procedures to prevent disputes concerning rights to intellectual property
developed on privately owned equipment;
g) access to privately owned equipment (to check the security of the machine or during an
investigation), which may be prevented by legislation;
h) software licensing agreements that are such that organizations may become liable for
licensing for client software on workstations owned privately by employees, contractors
or third party users;
i)

anti-virus protection and firewall requirements.

The guidelines and arrangements to be considered should include:
a) the provision of suitable equipment and storage furniture for the teleworking activities,
where the use of privately owned equipment that is not under the control of the
organization is not allowed;
b) a definition of the work permitted, the hours of work, the classification of information that
may be held and the internal systems and services that the teleworker is authorized to
access;
c) the provision of suitable communication equipment, including methods for securing
remote access;
d) physical security;
e) rules and guidance on family and visitor access to equipment and information;
f) the provision of hardware and software support and maintenance;
g) the provision of insurance;
h) the procedures for back-up and business continuity;
i)

audit and security monitoring;

j)

revocation of authority and access rights, and the return of equipment when the
teleworking activities are terminated.

Other information
Teleworking uses communications technology to enable personnel to work remotely from a fixed
location outside of their organization.

Information systems acquisition, development and maintenance

12.1

Security requirements of information systems

Objective: To ensure that security is an integral part of information systems.
Information systems include operating systems, infrastructure, business applications, off-the-shelf
products, services, and user-developed applications. The design and implementation of the
information system supporting the business process can be crucial for security. Security requirements
should be identified and agreed prior to the development and/or implementation of information
systems.
All security requirements should be identified at the requirements phase of a project and justified,
agreed, and documented as part of the overall business case for an information system.

12.1.1 Security requirements analysis and specification
Control
Statements of business requirements for new information systems, or enhancements to existing
information systems should specify the requirements for security controls.
Implementation guidance
Specifications for the requirements for controls should consider the automated controls to be
incorporated in the information system, and the need for supporting manual controls. Similar
considerations should be applied when evaluating software packages, developed or purchased, for
business applications.
Security requirements and controls should reflect the business value of the information assets involved
(see also 7.2), and the potential business damage, which might result from a failure or absence of
security.
System requirements for information security and processes for implementing security should be
integrated in the early stages of information system projects. Controls introduced at the design stage
are significantly cheaper to implement and maintain than those included during or after
implementation.
If products are purchased, a formal testing and acquisition process should be followed. Contracts with
the supplier should address the identified security requirements. Where the security functionality in a
proposed product does not satisfy the specified requirement then the risk introduced and associated
controls should be reconsidered prior to purchasing the product. Where additional functionality is
supplied and causes a security risk, this should be disabled or the proposed control structure should be
reviewed to determine if advantage can be taken of the enhanced functionality available.
Other information
If considered appropriate, for example for cost reasons, management may wish to make use of
independently evaluated and certified products. Further information about evaluation criteria for IT
security products can be found in ISO/IEC 15408 or other evaluation or certification standards, as
appropriate.
ISO/IEC TR 13335-3 provides guidance on the use of risk management processes to identify
requirements for security controls.

12.2

Correct processing in applications

Objective: To prevent errors, loss, unauthorized modification or misuse of information in applications.
Appropriate controls should be designed into applications, including user developed applications to
ensure correct processing. These controls should include the validation of input data, internal
processing and output data.
Additional controls may be required for systems that process, or have an impact on, sensitive, valuable
or critical information. Such controls should be determined on the basis of security requirements and
risk assessment.

12.2.1 Input data validation
Control
Data input to applications should be validated to ensure that this data is correct and appropriate.
Implementation guidance
Checks should be applied to the input of business transactions, standing data (e.g. names and
addresses, credit limits, customer reference numbers), and parameter tables (e.g. sales prices, currency
conversion rates, tax rates). The following guidelines should be considered:
a) dual input or other input checks, such as boundary checking or limiting fields to specific
ranges of input data, to detect the following errors:
1) out-of-range values;
2) invalid characters in data fields;
3) missing or incomplete data;
4) exceeding upper and lower data volume limits;
5) unauthorized or inconsistent control data;
b) periodic review of the content of key fields or data files to confirm their validity and
integrity;
c) inspecting hard-copy input documents for any unauthorized changes (all changes to input
documents should be authorized);
d) procedures for responding to validation errors;
e) procedures for testing the plausibility of the input data;
f) defining the responsibilities of all personnel involved in the data input process;
g) creating a log of the activities involved in the data input process (see 10.10.1).
Other information
Automatic examination and validation of input data can be considered, where applicable, to reduce the
risk of errors and to prevent standard attacks including buffer overflow and code injection.

12.2.2 Control of internal processing
Control
Validation checks should be incorporated into applications to detect any corruption of information
through processing errors or deliberate acts.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Implementation guidance
The design and implementation of applications should ensure that the risks of processing failures
leading to a loss of integrity are minimized. Specific areas to consider include:
a) the use of add, modify, and delete functions to implement changes to data;
b) the procedures to prevent programs running in the wrong order or running after failure of
prior processing (see also 10.1.1);
c) the use of appropriate programs to recover from failures to ensure the correct processing
of data;
d) protection against attacks using buffer overruns/overflows.
An appropriate checklist should be prepared, activities documented, and the results should be kept
secure. Examples of checks that can be incorporated include the following:
a) session or batch controls, to reconcile data file balances after transaction updates;
b) balancing controls, to check opening balances against previous closing balances, namely:
1) run-to-run controls;
2) file update totals;
3) program-to-program controls;
c) validation of system-generated input data (see 12.2.1);
d) checks on the integrity, authenticity or any other security feature of data or software
downloaded, or uploaded, between central and remote computers;
e) hash totals of records and files;
f) checks to ensure that application programs are run at the correct time;
g) checks to ensure that programs are run in the correct order and terminate in case of a
failure, and that further processing is halted until the problem is resolved;
h)

creating a log of the activities involved in the processing (see 10.10.1).

Other information
Data that has been correctly entered can be corrupted by hardware errors, processing errors or through
deliberate acts. The validation checks required will depend on the nature of the application and the
business impact of any corruption of data.

12.2.3 Message integrity
Control
Requirements for ensuring authenticity and protecting message integrity in applications should be
identified, and appropriate controls identified and implemented.
Implementation guidance
An assessment of security risks should be carried out to determine if message integrity is required and
to identify the most appropriate method of implementation.
Other information
Cryptographic techniques (see 12.3) can be used as an appropriate means of implementing message
authentication.

12.2.4 Output data validation
Control
Data output from an application should be validated to ensure that the processing of stored
information is correct and appropriate to the circumstances.

79

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Implementation guidance
Output validation may include:
a) plausibility checks to test whether the output data is reasonable;
b) reconciliation control counts to ensure processing of all data;
c) providing sufficient information for a reader or subsequent processing system to
determine the accuracy, completeness, precision, and classification of the information;
d) procedures for responding to output validation tests;
e) defining the responsibilities of all personnel involved in the data output process;
f) creating a log of activities in the data output validation process.
Other information
Typically, systems and applications are constructed on the assumption that having undertaken
appropriate validation, verification, and testing, the output will always be correct. However, this
assumption is not always valid; i.e. systems that have been tested may still produce incorrect output
under some circumstances.

12.3

Cryptographic controls

Objective: To protect the confidentiality, authenticity or integrity of information by cryptographic
means.
A policy should be developed on the use of cryptographic controls. Key management should be in
place to support the use of cryptographic techniques.

12.3.1 Policy on the use of cryptographic controls
Control
A policy on the use of cryptographic controls for protection of information should be developed and
implemented.
Implementation guidance
When developing a cryptographic policy the following should be considered:
a) the management approach towards the use of cryptographic controls across the
organization, including the general principles under which business information should be
protected (see also 5.1.1);
b) based on a risk assessment, the required level of protection should be identified taking
into account the type, strength, and quality of the encryption algorithm required;
c) the use of encryption for protection of sensitive information transported by mobile or
removable media, devices or across communication lines;
d) the approach to key management, including methods to deal with the protection of
cryptographic keys and the recovery of encrypted information in the case of lost,
compromised or damaged keys;
e) roles and responsibilities, e.g. who is responsible for:
1) the implementation of the policy;
2) the key management, including key generation (see also 12.3.2);

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
f) the standards to be adopted for the effective implementation throughout the organization
(which solution is used for which business processes);
g) the impact of using encrypted information on controls that rely upon content inspection
(e.g. virus detection).
When implementing the organization’s cryptographic policy, consideration should be given to the
regulations and national restrictions that might apply to the use of cryptographic techniques in
different parts of the world and to the issues of trans-border flow of encrypted information (see also
15.1.6).
Cryptographic controls can be used to achieve different security objectives, e.g.:
a) confidentiality: using encryption of information to protect sensitive or critical information,
either stored or transmitted;
b) integrity/authenticity: using digital signatures or message authentication codes to protect
the authenticity and integrity of stored or transmitted sensitive or critical information;
c) non-repudiation: using cryptographic techniques to obtain proof of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or action.
Other information
Making a decision as to whether a cryptographic solution is appropriate should be seen as part of the
wider process of risk assessment and selection of controls. This assessment can then be used to
determine whether a cryptographic control is appropriate, what type of control should be applied and
for what purpose and business processes.
A policy on the use of cryptographic controls is necessary to maximize the benefits and minimize the
risks of using cryptographic techniques, and to avoid inappropriate or incorrect use. When using
digital signatures, consideration should be given to any relevant legislation, in particular legislation
describing the conditions under which a digital signature is legally binding (see 15.1).
Specialist advice should be sought to identify the appropriate level of protection and to define suitable
specifications that will provide the required protection and support the implementation of a secure key
management system (see also 12.3.2).
ISO/IEC JTC1 SC27 has developed several standards related to cryptographic controls. Further
information can also be found in IEEE P1363 and the OECD Guidelines on Cryptography.

12.3.2 Key management
Control
Key management should be in place to support the organization’s use of cryptographic techniques.
Implementation guidance
All cryptographic keys should be protected against modification, loss, and destruction. In addition,
secret and private keys need protection against unauthorized disclosure. Equipment used to generate,
store and archive keys should be physically protected.
A key management system should be based on an agreed set of standards, procedures, and secure
methods for:
a) generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications;
b) generating and obtaining public key certificates;

81

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
c) distributing keys to intended users, including how keys should be activated when
received;
d) storing keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys;
e) changing or updating keys including rules on when keys should be changed and how this
will be done;
f) dealing with compromised keys;
g) revoking keys including how keys should be withdrawn or deactivated, e.g. when keys
have been compromised or when a user leaves an organization (in which case keys should
also be archived);
h) recovering keys that are lost or corrupted as part of business continuity management, e.g.
for recovery of encrypted information;
i)

archiving keys, e.g. for information archived or backed up;

j)

destroying keys;

k) logging and auditing of key management related activities.
In order to reduce the likelihood of compromise, activation, and deactivation dates for keys should be
defined so that the keys can only be used for a limited period of time. This period of time should be
dependent on the circumstances under which the cryptographic control is being used, and the
perceived risk.
In addition to securely managing secret and private keys, the authenticity of public keys should also
be considered. This authentication process can be done using public key certificates which are
normally issued by a certification authority, which should be a recognized organization with suitable
controls and procedures in place to provide the required degree of trust.
The contents of service level agreements or contracts with external suppliers of cryptographic
services, e.g. with a certification authority, should cover issues of liability, reliability of services and
response times for the provision of services (see 6.2.3).
Other information
The management of cryptographic keys is essential to the effective use of cryptographic techniques.
ISO/IEC 11770 provides further information on key management. The two types of cryptographic
techniques are:
a) secret key techniques, where two or more parties share the same key and this key is used
both to encrypt and decrypt information; this key has to be kept secret since anyone
having access to the key is able to decrypt all information being encrypted with that key,
or to introduce unauthorized information using the key;
b) public key techniques, where each user has a key pair, a public key (which can be
revealed to anyone) and a private key (which has to be kept secret); public key techniques
can be used for encryption and to produce digital signatures (see also ISO/IEC 9796 and
ISO/IEC 14888).
There is a threat of forging a digital signature by replacing a user’s public key. This problem is
addressed by the use of a public key certificate.
Cryptographic techniques can also be used to protect cryptographic keys. Procedures may need to be
considered for handling legal requests for access to cryptographic keys, e.g. encrypted information
may need to be made available in an unencrypted form as evidence in a court case.

12.4

Security of system files

Objective: To ensure the security of system files.
Access to system files and program source code should be controlled, and IT projects and support
activities conducted in a secure manner. Care should be taken to avoid exposure of sensitive data in
test environments.

12.4.1 Control of operational software
Control
There should be procedures in place to control the installation of software on operational systems.
Implementation guidance
To minimize the risk of corruption to operational systems, the following guidelines should be
considered to control changes:
a) the updating of the operational software, applications, and program libraries should only
be performed by trained administrators upon appropriate management authorization (see
12.4.3);
b) operational systems should only hold approved executable code, and not development
code or compilers;
c) applications and operating system software should only be implemented after extensive
and successful testing; the tests should include tests on usability, security, effects on other
systems and user-friendliness, and should be carried out on separate systems (see also
10.1.4); it should be ensured that all corresponding program source libraries have been
updated;
d) a configuration control system should be used to keep control of all implemented software
as well as the system documentation;
e) a rollback strategy should be in place before changes are implemented;
f) an audit log should be maintained of all updates to operational program libraries;
g) previous versions of application software should be retained as a contingency measure;
h) old versions of software should be archived, together with all required information and
parameters, procedures, configuration details, and supporting software for as long as the
data is retained in archive.
Vendor supplied software used in operational systems should be maintained at a level supported by
the supplier. Over time, software vendors will cease to support older versions of software. The
organization should consider the risks of relying on unsupported software.
Any decision to upgrade to a new release should take into account the business requirements for the
change, and the security of the release, i.e. the introduction of new security functionality or the
number and severity of security problems affecting this version. Software patches should be applied
when they can help to remove or reduce security weaknesses (see also 12.6.1).
Physical or logical access should only be given to suppliers for support purposes when necessary, and
with management approval. The supplier’s activities should be monitored.
Computer software may rely on externally supplied software and modules, which should be monitored
and controlled to avoid unauthorized changes, which could introduce security weaknesses.

83

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Other information
Operating systems should only be upgraded when there is a requirement to do so, for example, if the
current version of the operating system no longer supports the business requirements. Upgrades
should not take place just because a new version of the operating system is available. New versions of
operating systems may be less secure, less stable, and less well understood than current systems.

12.4.2 Protection of system test data
Control
Test data should be selected carefully, and protected and controlled.
Implementation guidance
The use of operational databases containing personal information or any other sensitive information
for testing purposes should be avoided. If personal or otherwise sensitive information is used for
testing purposes, all sensitive details and content should be removed or modified beyond recognition
before use. The following guidelines should be applied to protect operational data, when used for
testing purposes:
a) the access control procedures, which apply to operational application systems, should also
apply to test application systems;
b) there should be separate authorization each time operational information is copied to a test
application system;
c) operational information should be erased from a test application system immediately after
the testing is complete;
d) the copying and use of operational information should be logged to provide an audit trail.
Other information
System and acceptance testing usually requires substantial volumes of test data that are as close as
possible to operational data.

12.4.3 Access control to program source code
Control
Access to program source code should be restricted.
Implementation guidance
Access to program source code and associated items (such as designs, specifications, verification
plans and validation plans) should be strictly controlled, in order to prevent the introduction of
unauthorized functionality and to avoid unintentional changes. For program source code, this can be
achieved by controlled central storage of such code, preferably in program source libraries. The
following guidelines should then be considered (see also 11) to control access to such program source
libraries in order to reduce the potential for corruption of computer programs:
a) where possible, program source libraries should not be held in operational systems;
b) the program source code and the program source libraries should be managed according
to established procedures;
c) support personnel should not have unrestricted access to program source libraries;
d) the updating of program source libraries and associated items, and the issuing of program
sources to programmers should only be performed after appropriate authorization has
been received;
e) program listings should be held in a secure environment (see 10.7.4);

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
f) an audit log should be maintained of all accesses to program source libraries;
g) maintenance and copying of program source libraries should be subject to strict change
control procedures (see 12.5.1).
Other information
Program source code is code written by programmers, which is compiled (and linked) to create
executables. Certain programming languages do not formally distinguish between source code and
executables as the executables are created at the time they are activated.
The standards ISO 10007 and ISO/IEC 12207 provide further information about configuration
management and the software lifecycle process.

12.5

Security in development and support processes

Objective: To maintain the security of application system software and information.
Project and support environments should be strictly controlled.
Managers responsible for application systems should also be responsible for the security of the project
or support environment. They should ensure that all proposed system changes are reviewed to check
that they do not compromise the security of either the system or the operating environment.

12.5.1 Change control procedures
Control
The implementation of changes should be controlled by the use of formal change control procedures.
Implementation guidance
Formal change control procedures should be documented and enforced in order to minimize the
corruption of information systems. Introduction of new systems and major changes to existing
systems should follow a formal process of documentation, specification, testing, quality control, and
managed implementation.
This process should include a risk assessment, analysis of the impacts of changes, and specification of
security controls needed. This process should also ensure that existing security and control
procedures are not compromised, that support programmers are given access only to those parts of the
system necessary for their work, and that formal agreement and approval for any change is obtained.
Wherever practicable, application and operational change control procedures should be integrated (see
also 10.1.2). The change procedures should include:
a) maintaining a record of agreed authorization levels;
b) ensuring changes are submitted by authorized users;
c) reviewing controls and integrity procedures to ensure that they will not be compromised
by the changes;
d) identifying all software, information, database entities, and hardware that require
amendment;
e) obtaining formal approval for detailed proposals before work commences;
f) ensuring authorized users accept changes prior to implementation;
g) ensuring that the system documentation set is updated on the completion of each change
and that old documentation is archived or disposed of;
h) maintaining a version control for all software updates;
i)

maintaining an audit trail of all change requests;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
j)

ensuring that operating documentation (see 10.1.1) and user procedures are changed as
necessary to remain appropriate;

k) ensuring that the implementation of changes takes place at the right time and does not
disturb the business processes involved.
Other information
Changing software can impact the operational environment.
Good practice includes the testing of new software in an environment segregated from both the
production and development environments (see also 10.1.4). This provides a means of having control
over new software and allowing additional protection of operational information that is used for
testing purposes. This should include patches, service packs, and other updates. Automated updates
should not be used on critical systems as some updates may cause critical applications to fail (see
12.6).

12.5.2 Technical review of applications after operating system changes
Control
When operating systems are changed, business critical applications should be reviewed and tested to
ensure there is no adverse impact on organizational operations or security.
Implementation guidance
This process should cover:
a) review of application control and integrity procedures to ensure that they have not been
compromised by the operating system changes;
b) ensuring that the annual support plan and budget will cover reviews and system testing
resulting from operating system changes;
c) ensuring that notification of operating system changes is provided in time to allow
appropriate tests and reviews to take place before implementation;
d) ensuring that appropriate changes are made to the business continuity plans (see clause
14).
A specific group or individual should be given responsibility for monitoring vulnerabilities and
vendors’ releases of patches and fixes (see 12.6).

12.5.3 Restrictions on changes to software packages
Control
Modifications to software packages should be discouraged, limited to necessary changes, and all
changes should be strictly controlled.
Implementation guidance
As far as possible, and practicable, vendor-supplied software packages should be used without
modification. Where a software package needs to be modified the following points should be
considered:
a) the risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being compromised;
b) whether the consent of the vendor should be obtained;
c) the possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as standard program
updates;
d) the impact if the organization becomes responsible for the future maintenance of the
software as a result of changes.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
If changes are necessary the original software should be retained and the changes applied to a clearly
identified copy. A software update management process should be implemented to ensure the most
up-to-date approved patches and application updates are installed for all authorized software (see
12.6). All changes should be fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied if necessary
to future software upgrades. If required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an
independent evaluation body.

12.5.4 Information leakage
Control
Opportunities for information leakage should be prevented.
Implementation guidance
The following should be considered to limit the risk of information leakage, e.g. through the use and
exploitation of covert channels:
a) scanning of outbound media and communications for hidden information;
b) masking and modulating system and communications behaviour to reduce the likelihood
of a third party being able to deduce information from such behaviour;
c) making use of systems and software that are considered to be of high integrity, e.g. using
evaluated products (see ISO/IEC 15408);
d) regular monitoring of personnel and system activities, where permitted under existing
legislation or regulation;
e) monitoring resource usage in computer systems.
Other information
Covert Channels are paths which are not intended to conduct information flows, but which may
nevertheless exist in a system or network. For example, manipulating bits in communications protocol
packets could be used as a hidden method of signaling. By their nature, preventing the existence of all
possible covert channels would be difficult, if not impossible. However, the exploitation of such
channels is often carried out by Trojan code (see also 10.4.1). Taking measures to protect against
Trojan code therefore reduces the risk of covert channel exploitation.
Prevention of unauthorized network access (11.4), as well as policies and procedures to discourage
misuse of information services by personnel (15.1.5), will help to protect against covert channels.

12.5.5 Outsourced software development
Control
Outsourced software development should be supervised and monitored by the organization.
Implementation guidance
Where software development is outsourced, the following points should be considered:
a) licensing arrangements, code ownership, and intellectual property rights (see 15.1.2);
b) certification of the quality and accuracy of the work carried out;
c) escrow arrangements in the event of failure of the third party;
d) rights of access for audit of the quality and accuracy of work done;
e) contractual requirements for quality and security functionality of code;
f) testing before installation to detect malicious and Trojan code.

12.6

Technical Vulnerability Management

Objective: To reduce risks resulting from exploitation of published technical vulnerabilities.
Technical vulnerability management should be implemented in an effective, systematic, and
repeatable way with measurements taken to confirm its effectiveness. These considerations should
include operating systems, and any other applications in use.

12.6.1 Control of technical vulnerabilities
Control
Timely information about technical vulnerabilities of information systems being used should be
obtained, the organization's exposure to such vulnerabilities evaluated, and appropriate measures
taken to address the associated risk.
Implementation guidance
A current and complete inventory of assets (see 7.1) is a prerequisite for effective technical
vulnerability management. Specific information needed to support technical vulnerability
management includes the software vendor, version numbers, current state of deployment (e.g. what
software is installed on what systems), and the person(s) within the organization responsible for the
software.
Appropriate, timely action should be taken in response to the identification of potential technical
vulnerabilities. The following guidance should be followed to establish an effective management
process for technical vulnerabilities:
a) the organization should define and establish the roles and responsibilities associated with
technical vulnerability management, including vulnerability monitoring, vulnerability risk
assessment, patching, asset tracking, and any coordination responsibilities required;
b) information resources that will be used to identify relevant technical vulnerabilities and to
maintain awareness about them should be identified for software and other technology
(based on the asset inventory list, see 7.1.1); these information resources should be
updated based on changes in the inventory, or when other new or useful resources are
found;
c) a timeline should be defined to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical
vulnerabilities;
d) once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified, the organization should
identify the associated risks and the actions to be taken; such action could involve
patching of vulnerable systems and/or applying other controls;
e) depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, the action
taken should be carried out according to the controls related to change management (see
12.5.1) or by following information security incident response procedures (see 13.2);
f) if a patch is available, the risks associated with installing the patch should be assessed (the
risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the patch);
g) patches should be tested and evaluated before they are installed to ensure they are
effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be tolerated; if no patch is available,
other controls should be considered, such as
1) turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability;
2) adapting or adding access controls, e.g. firewalls, at network borders (see 11.4.5);
3) increased monitoring to detect or prevent actual attacks;
4) raising awareness of the vulnerability;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
h) an audit log should be kept for all procedures undertaken;
i)

the technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and
evaluated in order to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency;

j)

systems at high risk should be addressed first.

Other information
The correct functioning of an organization’s technical vulnerability management process is critical to
many organizations and should therefore be regularly monitored. An accurate inventory is essential to
ensure that potentially relevant technical vulnerabilities are identified.
Technical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as
such can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures (see 10.1.2 and 12.5.1).
Vendors are often under significant pressure to release patches as soon as possible. Therefore, a patch
may not address the problem adequately and may have negative side effects. Also, in some cases,
uninstalling a patch may not be easily achieved once the patch has been applied.
If adequate testing of the patches is not possible, e.g. because of costs or lack of resources, a delay in
patching can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other
users.

Information security incident management

13.1

Reporting information security events and weaknesses

Objective: To ensure information security events and weaknesses associated with information systems
are communicated in a manner allowing timely corrective action to be taken.
Formal event reporting and escalation procedures should be in place. All employees, contractors and
third party users should be made aware of the procedures for reporting the different types of event and
weakness that might have an impact on the security of organizational assets. They should be required
to report any information security events and weaknesses as quickly as possible to the designated
point of contact.

13.1.1 Reporting information security events
Control
Information security events should be reported through appropriate management channels as quickly
as possible.
Implementation guidance
A formal information security event reporting procedure should be established, together with an
incident response and escalation procedure, setting out the action to be taken on receipt of a report of
an information security event. A point of contact should be established for the reporting of
information security events. It should be ensured that this point of contact is known throughout the
organization, is always available and is able to provide adequate and timely response.
All employees, contractors and third party users should be made aware of their responsibility to report
any information security events as quickly as possible. They should also be aware of the procedure
for reporting information security events and the point of contact. The reporting procedures should
include:
a) suitable feedback processes to ensure that those reporting information security events are
notified of results after the issue has been dealt with and closed;
b) information security event reporting forms to support the reporting action, and to help the
person reporting to remember all necessary actions in case of an information security
event;
c) the correct behaviour to be undertaken in case of an information security event, i.e.
1) noting all important details (e.g. type of non-compliance or breach, occurring
malfunction, messages on the screen, strange behaviour) immediately;
2) not carrying out any own action, but immediately reporting to the point of contact;
d) reference to an established formal disciplinary process for dealing with employees,
contractors or third party users who commit security breaches.
In high-risk environments, a duress alarm 4 may be provided whereby a person under duress can
indicate such problems. The procedures for responding to duress alarms should reflect the high risk
situation such alarms are indicating.

4

A duress alarm is a method for secretly indicating that an action is taking place 'under duress.'

Other Information
Examples of information security events and incidents are:
a) loss of service, equipment or facilities,
b) system malfunctions or overloads,
c) human errors,
d) non-compliances with policies or guidelines,
e) breaches of physical security arrangements,
f) uncontrolled system changes,
g) malfunctions of software or hardware,
h) access violations.
With due care of confidentiality aspects, information security incidents can be used in user awareness
training (see 8.2.2) as examples of what could happen, how to respond to such incidents, and how to
avoid them in the future. To be able to address information security events and incidents properly it
might be necessary to collect evidence as soon as possible after the occurrence (see 13.2.3).
Malfunctions or other anomalous system behavior may be an indicator of a security attack or actual
security breach and should therefore always be reported as information security event.
More information about reporting of information security events and management of information
security incidents can be found in ISO/IEC TR 18044.

13.1.2 Reporting security weaknesses
Control
All employees, contractors and third party users of information systems and services should be
required to note and report any observed or suspected security weaknesses in systems or services.
Implementation guidance
All employees, contractors and third party users should report these matters either to their
management or directly to their service provider as quickly as possible in order to prevent information
security incidents. The reporting mechanism should be as easy, accessible, and available as possible.
They should be informed that they should not, in any circumstances, attempt to prove a suspected
weakness.
Other Information
Employees, contractors and third party users should be advised not to attempt to prove suspected
security weaknesses. Testing weaknesses might be interpreted as a potential misuse of the system and
could also cause damage to the information system or service and result in legal liability for the
individual performing the testing.

13.2

Management of information security incidents and improvements

Objective: To ensure a consistent and effective approach is applied to the management of information
security incidents.
Responsibilities and procedures should be in place to handle information security events and
weaknesses effectively once they have been reported. A process of continual improvement should be
applied to the response to, monitoring, evaluating, and overall management of information security
incidents.
Where evidence is required, it should be collected to ensure compliance with legal requirements.

13.2.1 Responsibilities and procedures
Control
Management responsibilities and procedures should be established to ensure a quick, effective, and
orderly response to information security incidents.
Implementation guidance
In addition to reporting of information security events and weaknesses (see also 13.1), the monitoring
of systems, alerts, and vulnerabilities (10.10.2) should be used to detect information security incidents.
The following guidelines for information security incident management procedures should be
considered:
a) procedures should be established to handle different types of information security incident,
including:
1) information system failures and loss of service;
2) malicious code (see 10.4.1);
3) denial of service;
4) errors resulting from incomplete or inaccurate business data;
5) breaches of confidentiality and integrity;
6) misuse of information systems;
b) in addition to normal contingency plans (see 14.1.3), the procedures should also cover
(see also 13.2.2):
1) analysis and identification of the cause of the incident;
2) containment;
3) planning and implementation of corrective action to prevent recurrence, if necessary;
4) communication with those affected by or involved with recovery from the incident;
5) reporting the action to the appropriate authority;
c) audit trails and similar evidence should be collected (see 13.2.3) and secured, as
appropriate, for:
1) internal problem analysis;
2) use as forensic evidence in relation to a potential breach of contract or
regulatory requirement or in the event of civil or criminal proceedings, e.g. under
computer misuse or data protection legislation;
3) negotiating for compensation from software and service suppliers;
d) action to recover from security breaches and correct system failures should be carefully
and formally controlled; the procedures should ensure that:
1) only clearly identified and authorized personnel are allowed access to live systems
and data (see also 6.2 for external access);
2) all emergency actions taken are documented in detail;
3) emergency action is reported to management and reviewed in an orderly manner;
4) the integrity of business systems and controls is confirmed with minimal delay.
The objectives for information security incident management should be agreed with management, and
it should be ensured that those responsible for information security incident management understand
the organization’s priorities for handling information security incidents.

Other information
Information security incidents might transcend organizational and national boundaries. To respond to
such incidents there is an increasing need to coordinate response and share information about these
incidents with external organizations as appropriate.

13.2.2 Learning from information security incidents
Control
There should be mechanisms in place to enable the types, volumes, and costs of information security
incidents to be quantified and monitored.
Implementation guidance
The information gained from the evaluation of information security incidents should be used to
identify recurring or high impact incidents.
Other Information
The evaluation of information security incidents may indicate the need for enhanced or additional
controls to limit the frequency, damage, and cost of future occurrences, or to be taken into account in
the security policy review process (see 5.1.2).

13.2.3 Collection of evidence
Control
Where a follow-up action against a person or organization after an information security incident
involves legal action (either civil or criminal), evidence should be collected, retained, and presented to
conform to the rules for evidence laid down in the relevant jurisdiction(s).
Implementation guidance
Internal procedures should be developed and followed when collecting and presenting evidence for
the purposes of disciplinary action handled within an organization.
In general, the rules for evidence cover:
a) admissibility of evidence: whether or not the evidence can be used in court;
b) weight of evidence: the quality and completeness of the evidence.
To achieve admissibility of the evidence, the organization should ensure that their information
systems comply with any published standard or code of practice for the production of admissible
evidence.
The weight of evidence provided should comply with any applicable requirements. To achieve weight
of evidence, the quality and completeness of the controls used to correctly and consistently protect the
evidence (i.e. process control evidence) throughout the period that the evidence to be recovered was
stored and processed should be demonstrated by a strong evidence trail. In general, such a strong trail
can be established under the following conditions:
a) for paper documents: the original is kept securely with a record of the individual who
found the document, where the document was found, when the document was found and
who witnessed the discovery; any investigation should ensure that originals are not
tampered with;
b) for information on computer media: mirror images or copies (depending on applicable
requirements) of any removable media, information on hard disks or in memory should be
taken to ensure availability; the log of all actions during the copying process should be
kept and the process should be witnessed; the original media and the log (if this is not
possible, at least one mirror image or copy) should be kept securely and untouched.

93

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Any forensics work should only be performed on copies of the evidential material. The integrity of all
evidential material should be protected. Copying of evidential material should be supervised by
trustworthy personnel and information on when and where the copying process was executed, who
performed the copying activities and which tools and programs have been utilized should be logged.
Other information
When an information security event is first detected, it may not be obvious whether or not the event
will result in court action. Therefore, the danger exists that necessary evidence is destroyed
intentionally or accidentally before the seriousness of the incident is realized. It is advisable to involve
a lawyer or the police early in any contemplated legal action and take advice on the evidence required.
Evidence may transcend organizational and/or jurisdictional boundaries. In such cases, it should be
ensured that the organization is entitled to collect the required information as evidence. The
requirements of different jurisdictions should also be considered to maximize chances of admission
across the relevant jurisdictions.

Business continuity management

14.1

Information security aspects of business continuity management

Objective: To counteract interruptions to business activities and to protect critical business processes
from the effects of major failures of information systems or disasters and to ensure their timely
resumption.
A business continuity management process should be implemented to minimize the impact on the
organization and recover from loss of information assets (which may be the result of, for example,
natural disasters, accidents, equipment failures, and deliberate actions) to an acceptable level through
a combination of preventive and recovery controls. This process should identify the critical business
processes and integrate the information security management requirements of business continuity with
other continuity requirements relating to such aspects as operations, staffing, materials, transport and
facilities.
The consequences of disasters, security failures, loss of service, and service availability should be
subject to a business impact analysis. Business continuity plans should be developed and implemented
to ensure timely resumption of essential operations. Information security should be an integral part of
the overall business continuity process, and other management processes within the organization.
Business continuity management should include controls to identify and reduce risks, in addition to
the general risks assessment process, limit the consequences of damaging incidents, and ensure that
information required for business processes is readily available.

14.1.1 Including information security in the business continuity management process
Control
A managed process should be developed and maintained for business continuity throughout the
organization that addresses the information security requirements needed for the organization’s
business continuity.
Implementation guidance
The process should bring together the following key elements of business continuity management:
a) understanding the risks the organization is facing in terms of likelihood and impact in
time, including an identification and prioritisation of critical business processes (see
14.1.2);
b) identifying all the assets involved in critical business processes (see 7.1.1);
c) understanding the impact which interruptions caused by information security incidents are
likely to have on the business (it is important that solutions are found that will handle
incidents causing smaller impact, as well as serious incidents that could threaten the
viability of the organization), and establishing the business objectives of information
processing facilities;
d) considering the purchase of suitable insurance which may form part of the overall
business continuity process, as well as being part of operational risk management;
e) identifying and considering the implementation of additional preventive and mitigating
controls;
f) identifying sufficient financial, organizational, technical, and environmental resources to
address the identified information security requirements;
g) ensuring the safety of personnel and the protection of information processing facilities
and organizational property;

95

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
h) formulating and documenting business continuity plans addressing information security
requirements in line with the agreed business continuity strategy (see 14.1.3);
i)

regular testing and updating of the plans and processes put in place (see 14.1.5);

j)

ensuring that the management of business continuity is incorporated in the organization’s
processes and structure; responsibility for the business continuity management process
should be assigned at an appropriate level within the organization (see 6.1.1).

14.1.2 Business continuity and risk assessment
Control
Events that can cause interruptions to business processes should be identified, along with the
probability and impact of such interruptions and their consequences for information security.
Implementation guidance
Information security aspects of business continuity should be based on identifying events (or sequence
of events) that can cause interruptions to the organizations business processes, e.g. equipment failure,
human errors, theft, fire, natural disasters and acts of terrorism. This should be followed by a risk
assessment to determine the probability and impact of such interruptions, in terms of time, damage
scale and recovery period.
Business continuity risk assessments should be carried out with full involvement from owners of
business resources and processes. This assessment should consider all business processes and should
not be limited to the information processing facilities, but should include the results specific to
information security. It is important to link the different risk aspects together, to obtain a complete
picture of the business continuity requirements of the organization. The assessment should identify,
quantify, and prioritise risks against criteria and objectives relevant to the organization, including
critical resources, impacts of disruptions, allowable outage times, and recovery priorities.
Depending on the results of the risk assessment, a business continuity strategy should be developed to
determine the overall approach to business continuity. Once this strategy has been created,
endorsement should be provided by management, and a plan created and endorsed to implement this
strategy.

14.1.3 Developing and implementing continuity plans including information security
Control
Plans should be developed and implemented to maintain or restore operations and ensure availability
of information at the required level and in the required time scales following interruption to, or failure
of, critical business processes.
Implementation guidance
The business continuity planning process should consider the following:
a) identification and agreement of all responsibilities and business continuity procedures;
b) identification of the acceptable loss of information and services;
c) implementation of the procedures to allow recovery and restoration of business operations
and availability of information in required time-scales; particular attention needs to be
given to the assessment of internal and external business dependencies and the contracts
in place;
d) operational procedures to follow pending completion of recovery and restoration;
e) documentation of agreed procedures and processes;

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
f) appropriate education of staff in the agreed procedures and processes, including crisis
management;
g) testing and updating of the plans.
The planning process should focus on the required business objectives, e.g. restoring of specific
communication services to customers in an acceptable amount of time. The services and resources
facilitating this should be identified, including staffing, non-information processing resources, as well
as fallback arrangements for information processing facilities. Such fallback arrangements may
include arrangements with third parties in the form of reciprocal agreements, or commercial
subscription services.
Business continuity plans should address organizational vulnerabilities and therefore may contain
sensitive information that needs to be appropriately protected. Copies of business continuity plans
should be stored in a remote location, at a sufficient distance to escape any damage from a disaster at
the main site. Management should ensure copies of the business continuity plans are up-to-date and
protected with the same level of security as applied at the main site. Other material necessary to
execute the continuity plans should also be stored at the remote location.
If alternative temporary locations are used, the level of implemented security controls at these
locations should be equivalent to the main site.
Other information
It should be noted that crisis management plans and activities (see 14.1.3 f)) may be different from
business continuity management; i.e. a crisis may occur that can be accommodated by normal
management procedures.

14.1.4 Business continuity planning framework
Control
A single framework of business continuity plans should be maintained to ensure all plans are
consistent, to consistently address information security requirements, and to identify priorities for
testing and maintenance.
Implementation guidance
Each business continuity plan should describe the approach for continuity, for example the approach
to ensure information or information system availability and security. Each plan should also specify
the escalation plan and the conditions for its activation, as well as the individuals responsible for
executing each component of the plan. When new requirements are identified, any existing emergency
procedures, e.g. evacuation plans or fallback arrangements, should be amended as appropriate.
Procedures should be included within the organization’s change management programme to ensure
that business continuity matters are always addressed appropriately.
Each plan should have a specific owner. Emergency procedures, manual fallback plans, and
resumption plans should be within the responsibility of the owners of the appropriate business
resources or processes involved. Fallback arrangements for alternative technical services, such as
information processing and communications facilities, should usually be the responsibility of the
service providers.
A business continuity planning framework should address the identified information security
requirements and consider the following:
a) the conditions for activating the plans which describe the process to be followed (e.g. how
to assess the situation, who is to be involved) before each plan is activated;

97

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
b) emergency procedures, which describe the actions to be taken following an incident,
which jeopardizes business operations;
c) fallback procedures which describe the actions to be taken to move essential business
activities or support services to alternative temporary locations, and to bring business
processes back into operation in the required time-scales;
d) temporary operational procedures to follow pending completion of recovery and
restoration;
e) resumption procedures which describe the actions to be taken to return to normal business
operations;
f) a maintenance schedule which specifies how and when the plan will be tested, and the
process for maintaining the plan;
g) awareness, education, and training activities which are designed to create understanding
of the business continuity processes and ensure that the processes continue to be effective;
h) the responsibilities of the individuals, describing who is responsible for executing which
component of the plan. Alternatives should be nominated as required;
i)

the critical assets and resources needed to be able to perform the emergency, fallback and
resumption procedures.

14.1.5 Testing, maintaining and re-assessing business continuity plans
Control
Business continuity plans should be tested and updated regularly to ensure that they are up to date and
effective.
Implementation guidance
Business continuity plan tests should ensure that all members of the recovery team and other relevant
staff are aware of the plans and their responsibility for business continuity and information security
and know their role when a plan is invoked.
The test schedule for business continuity plan(s) should indicate how and when each element of the
plan should be tested. Each element of the plan(s) should be tested frequently.
A variety of techniques should be used in order to provide assurance that the plan(s) will operate in
real life. These should include:
a) table-top testing of various scenarios (discussing the business recovery arrangements
using example interruptions);
b) simulations (particularly for training people in their post-incident/crisis management
roles);
c) technical recovery testing (ensuring information systems can be restored effectively);
d) testing recovery at an alternate site (running business processes in parallel with recovery
operations away from the main site);
e) tests of supplier facilities and services (ensuring externally provided services and products
will meet the contracted commitment);
f) complete rehearsals (testing that the organization, personnel, equipment, facilities, and
processes can cope with interruptions).

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
These techniques can be used by any organization. They should be applied in a way that is relevant to
the specific recovery plan. The results of tests should be recorded and actions taken to improve the
plans, where necessary.
Responsibility should be assigned for regular reviews of each business continuity plan. The
identification of changes in business arrangements not yet reflected in the business continuity plans
should be followed by an appropriate update of the plan. This formal change control process should
ensure that the updated plans are distributed and reinforced by regular reviews of the complete plan.
Examples of changes where updating of business continuity plans should be considered are
acquisition of new equipment, upgrading of systems and changes in:
a) personnel;
b) addresses or telephone numbers;
c) business strategy;
d) location, facilities, and resources;
e) legislation;
f) contractors, suppliers, and key customers;
g) processes, or new or withdrawn ones;
h) risk (operational and financial).

Compliance

15.1

Compliance with legal requirements

Objective: To avoid breaches of any law, statutory, regulatory or contractual obligations, and of any
security requirements.
The design, operation, use, and management of information systems may be subject to statutory,
regulatory, and contractual security requirements.
Advice on specific legal requirements should be sought from the organization’s legal advisers, or
suitably qualified legal practitioners. Legislative requirements vary from country to country and may
vary for information created in one country that is transmitted to another country (i.e. trans-border
data flow).

15.1.1 Identification of applicable legislation
Control
All relevant statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements and the organization’s approach to
meet these requirements should be explicitly defined, documented, and kept up to date for each
information system and the organization.
Implementation guidance
The specific controls and individual responsibilities to meet these requirements should be similarly
defined and documented.

15.1.2 Intellectual property rights (IPR)
Control
Appropriate procedures should be implemented to ensure compliance with legislative, regulatory, and
contractual requirements on the use of material in respect of which there may be intellectual property
rights and on the use of proprietary software products.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be considered to protect any material that may be considered
intellectual property:
a) publishing an intellectual property rights compliance policy which defines the legal use of
software and information products;
b) acquiring software only through known and reputable sources, to ensure that copyright is
not violated;
c) maintaining awareness of policies to protect intellectual property rights, and giving notice
of the intent to take disciplinary action against personnel breaching them;
d) maintaining appropriate asset registers, and identifying all assets with requirements to
protect intellectual property rights;
e) maintaining proof and evidence of ownership of licenses, master disks, manuals, etc;
f) implementing controls to ensure that any maximum number of users permitted is not
exceeded;
g) carrying out checks that only authorized software and licensed products are installed;
h) providing a policy for maintaining appropriate licence conditions;
i)

providing a policy for disposing or transferring software to others;

j)

using appropriate audit tools;

k) complying with terms and conditions for software and information obtained from public
networks;
l)

not duplicating, converting to another format or extracting from commercial recordings
(film, audio) other than permitted by copyright law;

m) not copying in full or in part, books, articles, reports or other documents, other than
permitted by copyright law.
Other information
Intellectual property rights include software or document copyright, design rights, trademarks, patents,
and source code licenses.
Proprietary software products are usually supplied under a license agreement that specifies license
terms and conditions, for example, limiting the use of the products to specified machines or limiting
copying to the creation of back-up copies only. The IPR situation of software developed by the
organization requires to be clarified with the staff.
Legislative, regulatory, and contractual requirements may place restrictions on the copying of
proprietary material. In particular, they may require that only material that is developed by the
organization, or that is licensed or provided by the developer to the organization, can be used.
Copyright infringement can lead to legal action, which may involve criminal proceedings.

15.1.3 Protection of organizational records
Control
Important records should be protected from loss, destruction, and falsification, in accordance with
statutory, regulatory, contractual, and business requirements.
Implementation guidance
Records should be categorized into record types, e.g. accounting records, database records, transaction
logs, audit logs, and operational procedures, each with details of retention periods and type of storage
media, e.g. paper, microfiche, magnetic, optical. Any related cryptographic keying material and
programs associated with encrypted archives or digital signatures (see 12.3), should also be stored to
enable decryption of the records for the length of time the records are retained.
Consideration should be given to the possibility of deterioration of media used for storage of records.
Storage and handling procedures should be implemented in accordance with manufacturer’s
recommendations. For long term storage, the use of paper and microfiche should be considered.
Where electronic storage media are chosen, procedures to ensure the ability to access data (both media
and format readability) throughout the retention period should be included, to safeguard against loss
due to future technology change.
Data storage systems should be chosen such that required data can be retrieved in an acceptable
timeframe and format, depending on the requirements to be fulfilled.
The system of storage and handling should ensure clear identification of records and of their retention
period as defined by national or regional legislation or regulations, if applicable. This system should
permit appropriate destruction of records after that period if they are not needed by the organization.
To meet these record safeguarding objectives, the following steps should be taken within an
organization:
a) guidelines should be issued on the retention, storage, handling, and disposal of records
and information;
Licensed to Mr. PEDDINTI

101

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
b) a retention schedule should be drawn up identifying records and the period of time for
which they should be retained;
c) an inventory of sources of key information should be maintained;
d) appropriate controls should be implemented to protect records and information from loss,
destruction, and falsification.
Other information
Some records may need to be securely retained to meet statutory, regulatory or contractual
requirements, as well as to support essential business activities. Examples include records that may be
required as evidence that an organization operates within statutory or regulatory rules, to ensure
adequate defense against potential civil or criminal action, or to confirm the financial status of an
organization with respect to shareholders, external parties, and auditors. The time period and data
content for information retention may be set by national law or regulation.
Further information about managing organizational records can be found in ISO 15489-1.

15.1.4 Data protection and privacy of personal information
Control
Data protection and privacy should be ensured as required in relevant legislation, regulations, and, if
applicable, contractual clauses.
Implementation guidance
An organizational data protection and privacy policy should be developed and implemented. This
policy should be communicated to all persons involved in the processing of personal information.
Compliance with this policy and all relevant data protection legislation and regulations requires
appropriate management structure and control. Often this is best achieved by the appointment of a
person responsible, such as a data protection officer, who should provide guidance to managers, users,
and service providers on their individual responsibilities and the specific procedures that should be
followed. Responsibility for handling personal information and ensuring awareness of the data
protection principles should be dealt with in accordance with relevant legislation and regulations.
Appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal information should be
implemented.
Other information
A number of countries have introduced legislation placing controls on the collection, processing, and
transmission of personal data (generally information on living individuals who can be identified from
that information). Depending on the respective national legislation, such controls may impose duties
on those collecting, processing, and disseminating personal information, and may restrict the ability to
transfer that data to other countries.

15.1.5 Prevention of misuse of information processing facilities
Control
Users should be deterred from using information processing facilities for unauthorized purposes.
Implementation guidance
Management should approve the use of information processing facilities. Any use of these facilities
for non-business purposes without management approval (see 6.1.4), or for any unauthorized
purposes, should be regarded as improper use of the facilities. If any unauthorized activity is identified
by monitoring or other means, this activity should be brought to the attention of the individual
manager concerned for consideration of appropriate disciplinary and/or legal action.
Legal advice should be taken before implementing monitoring procedures.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
All users should be aware of the precise scope of their permitted access and of the monitoring in place
to detect unauthorized use. This can be achieved by giving users written authorization, a copy of
which should be signed by the user and securely retained by the organization. Employees of an
organization, contractors, and third party users should be advised that no access will be permitted
except that which is authorized.
At log-on, a warning message should be presented to indicate that the information processing facility
being entered is owned by the organization and that unauthorized access is not permitted. The user has
to acknowledge and react appropriately to the message on the screen to continue with the log-on
process (see 11.5.1).
Other information
The information processing facilities of an organization are intended primarily or exclusively for
business purposes.
Intrusion detection, content inspection, and other monitoring tools may help prevent and detect misuse
of information processing facilities.
Many countries have legislation to protect against computer misuse. It may be a criminal offence to
use a computer for unauthorized purposes.
The legality of monitoring the usage varies from country to country and may require management to
advise all users of such monitoring and/or to obtain their agreement. Where the system being entered
is used for public access (e.g., a public web server) and is subject to security monitoring, a message
should be displayed saying so.

15.1.6 Regulation of cryptographic controls
Control
Cryptographic controls should be used in compliance with all relevant agreements, laws, and
regulations.
Implementation guidance
The following items should be considered for compliance with the relevant agreements, laws, and
regulations:
a) restrictions on import and/or export of computer hardware and software for performing
cryptographic functions;
b) restrictions on import and/or export of computer hardware and software which is designed
to have cryptographic functions added to it;
c) restrictions on the usage of encryption;
d) mandatory or discretionary methods of access by the countries’ authorities to information
encrypted by hardware or software to provide confidentiality of content.
Legal advice should be sought to ensure compliance with national laws and regulations. Before
encrypted information or cryptographic controls are moved to another country, legal advice should
also be taken.

15.2

Compliance with security policies and standards, and technical compliance

Objective: To ensure compliance of systems with organizational security policies and standards.
The security of information systems should be regularly reviewed.
Such reviews should be performed against the appropriate security policies and the technical
platforms and information systems should be audited for compliance with applicable security
implementation standards and documented security controls.

15.2.1 Compliance with security policies and standards
Control
Managers should ensure that all security procedures within their area of responsibility are carried out
correctly to achieve compliance with security policies and standards.
Implementation guidance
Managers should regularly review the compliance of information processing within their area of
responsibility with the appropriate security policies, standards, and any other security requirements.
If any non-compliance is found as a result of the review, managers should:
a) determine the causes of the non-compliance;
b) evaluate the need for actions to ensure that non-compliance do not recur;
c) determine and implement appropriate corrective action;
d) review the corrective action taken.
Results of reviews and corrective actions carried out by managers should be recorded and these
records should be maintained. Managers should report the results to the persons carrying out the
independent reviews (see 6.1.8), when the independent review takes place in the area of their
responsibility.
Other information
Operational monitoring of system use is covered in 10.10.

15.2.2 Technical compliance checking
Control
Information systems should be regularly checked for compliance with security implementation
standards.
Implementation guidance
Technical compliance checking should be performed either manually (supported by appropriate
software tools, if necessary) by an experienced system engineer, and/or with the assistance of
automated tools, which generate a technical report for subsequent interpretation by a technical
specialist.
If penetration tests or vulnerability assessments are used, caution should be exercised as such
activities could lead to a compromise of the security of the system. Such tests should be planned,
documented and repeatable.
Any technical compliance check should only be carried out by competent, authorized persons, or
under the supervision of such persons.
Other information
Technical compliance checking involves the examination of operational systems to ensure that
hardware and software controls have been correctly implemented. This type of compliance checking
requires specialist technical expertise.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Compliance checking also covers, for example, penetration testing and vulnerability assessments,
which might be carried out by independent experts specifically contracted for this purpose. This can
be useful in detecting vulnerabilities in the system and for checking how effective the controls are in
preventing unauthorized access due to these vulnerabilities.
Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments provide a snapshot of a system in a specific state at a
specific time. The snapshot is limited to those portions of the system actually tested during the
penetration attempt(s). Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments are not a substitute for risk
assessment.

15.3

Information systems audit considerations

Objective: To maximize the effectiveness of and to minimize interference to/from the information
systems audit process.
There should be controls to safeguard operational systems and audit tools during information systems
audits.
Protection is also required to safeguard the integrity and prevent misuse of audit tools.

15.3.1 Information systems audit controls
Control
Audit requirements and activities involving checks on operational systems should be carefully planned
and agreed to minimize the risk of disruptions to business processes.
Implementation guidance
The following guidelines should be observed:
a) audit requirements should be agreed with appropriate management;
b) the scope of the checks should be agreed and controlled;
c) the checks should be limited to read-only access to software and data;
d) access other than read-only should only be allowed for isolated copies of system files,
which should be erased when the audit is completed, or given appropriate protection if
there is an obligation to keep such files under audit documentation requirements;
e) resources for performing the checks should be explicitly identified and made available;
f) requirements for special or additional processing should be identified and agreed;
g) all access should be monitored and logged to produce a reference trail; the use of timestamped reference trails should be considered for critical data or systems;
h) all procedures, requirements, and responsibilities should be documented;
i)

the person(s) carrying out the audit should be independent of the activities audited.

15.3.2 Protection of information systems audit tools
Control
Access to information systems audit tools should be protected to prevent any possible misuse or
compromise.
Implementation guidance
Information systems audit tools, e.g. software or data files, should be separated from development and
operational systems and not held in tape libraries or user areas, unless given an appropriate level of
additional protection.

ISO/IEC 17799:2005(E)
Other information
If third parties are involved in an audit, there might be a risk of misuse of audit tools by these third
parties, and information being accessed by this third party organization. Controls such as 6.2.1 (to
assess the risks) and 9.1.2 (to restrict physical access) can be considered to address this risk, and any
consequences, such as immediately changing passwords disclosed to the auditors, should be taken.

Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27003 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,

Introduction
The purpose of this International Standard is to provide practical guidance in developing the implementation
plan for an Information Security Management System (ISMS) within an organization in accordance with
ISO/IEC 27001:2005. The actual implementation of an ISMS is generally executed as a project.
The process described within this International Standard has been designed to provide support of the
implementation of ISO/IEC 27001:2005; (relevant parts from Clauses 4, 5, and 7 inclusive) and document:
a)

the preparation of beginning an ISMS implementation plan in an organization, defining the organizational
structure for the project, and gaining management approval,

b)

the critical activities for the ISMS project and,

c)

examples to achieve the requirements in ISO/IEC 27001:2005.

By using this International Standard the organization will be able to develop a process for information security
management, giving stakeholders the assurance that risks to information assets are continuously maintained
within acceptable information security bounds as defined by the organization.
This International Standard does not cover the operational activities and other ISMS activities, but covers the
concepts on how to design the activities which will result after the ISMS operations begin. The concept results
in the final ISMS project implementation plan. The actual execution of the organizational specific part of an
ISMS project is outside the scope of this International Standard.
The implementation of the ISMS project should be carried out using standard project management
methodologies (for more information please see ISO and ISO/IEC Standards addressing project
management).

Scope

This International Standard focuses on the critical aspects needed for successful design and implementation
of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2005. It describes
the process of ISMS specification and design from inception to the production of implementation plans. It
describes the process of obtaining management approval to implement an ISMS, defines a project to
implement an ISMS (referred to in this International Standard as the ISMS project), and provides guidance on
how to plan the ISMS project, resulting in a final ISMS project implementation plan.
This International Standard is intended to be used by organizations implementing an ISMS. It is applicable to
all types of organization (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies, non-profit organizations) of all
sizes. Each organization's complexity and risks are unique, and its specific requirements will drive the ISMS
implementation. Smaller organizations will find that the activities noted in this International Standard are
applicable to them and can be simplified. Large-scale or complex organizations might find that a layered
organization or management system is needed to manage the activities in this International Standard
effectively. However, in both cases, the relevant activities can be planned by applying this International
Standard.
This International Standard gives recommendations and explanations; it does not specify any requirements.
This International Standard is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and
ISO/IEC 27002:2005, but is not intended to modify and/or reduce the requirements specified in
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 or the recommendations provided in ISO/IEC 27002:2005. Claiming conformity to this
International Standard is not appropriate.

General structure of a clause

Each clause contains:
a)

one or more objectives stating what is to be achieved noted in the beginning of each clause in a text box;

and
b)

one or more activities necessary to achieve the phase objective or objectives.

Each activity is described in a subclause.
Activity descriptions in each subclause are structured as follows:
Activity
The activity defines what is necessary to satisfy this activity which achieves all or part of the phase objectives.
Input
The input describes the starting point, such as the existence of documented decisions or outputs from other
activities described in this International Standard. Inputs could either be referred to as the complete output
from an activity just stating the relevant clause or specific information from an activity may be added after the
clause reference.
Guidance
The guidance provides detailed information to enable performing this activity. Some of the guidance may not
be suitable in all cases and other ways of achieving the results may be more appropriate.
Output
The output describes the result(s) or deliverable(s), upon completion of the activity; e.g. a document. The
outputs are the same, independent of the size of the organization or the ISMS scope.
Other information
The other information provides any additional information that may assist in performing the activity, for
example references to other standards.
NOTE
The phases and activities described in this document include a suggested sequence of performing activities
based on the dependencies identified through each of the activities’ “Input” and “Output” descriptions. However,
depending on many different factors (e.g., effectiveness of management system currently in place, understanding with
regard to the importance of information security, reasons for implementing an ISMS), an organization may select any
activity in any order as necessary to prepare for the establishment and implementation of the ISMS.

Obtaining management approval for initiating an ISMS project
Overview of obtaining management approval for initiating an ISMS project

There are several factors that should be taken into consideration when deciding to implement an ISMS. In
order to address these factors, management should understand the business case of an ISMS implementation
project and approve it. Therefore the objective of this phase is:
Objective:
To obtain management approval to start the ISMS project by defining a business case and the project plan.
In order to acquire management approval, an organization should create a business case which includes the
priorities and objectives to implement an ISMS in addition to the structure of the organization for the ISMS.
The initial ISMS project plan should also be created.
The work performed in this phase will enable the organization to understand the relevance of an ISMS, and
clarify the information security roles and responsibilities within the organization needed for an ISMS project.
The expected output of this phase will be the preliminary management approval of, and commitment to
implement, an ISMS and performing the activities described in this International Standard. The deliverables
from this clause include a business case and a draft ISMS project plan with key milestones.
Figure 3 illustrates the process to obtain management approval to initiate the ISMS project.
NOTE
The output from Clause 5 (Documented management commitment to plan and implement an ISMS) and one
of the outputs of Clause 7 (Document summarization of the information security status) are not requirements of
ISO/IEC 27001:2005. However, the outputs from these activities are recommended input to other activities described in
this document.

security priorities and requirements.
Input
a)

the organization’s strategic objectives

b)

overview of the existing management systems

c)

a list of legal, regulatory, and contractual information security requirements applicable to the organization

Guidance
In order to start the ISMS project, management approval is generally needed. Therefore, the first activity that
should be performed is to collect the relevant information illustrating the value of an ISMS to the organization.
The organization should clarify why an ISMS is needed and decide the objectives of the ISMS implementation
and initiate the ISMS Project.
The objectives for implementing an ISMS can be determined by answering the following questions:
a)

risk management – How will an ISMS generate better management of information security risks?

b)

efficiency – How can an ISMS improve the management of information security?

c)

business advantage – How can an ISMS create competitive advantage for the organization?

In order to answer the questions above, the organization’s security priorities and requirements are addressed
by the following possible factors:
a)

b)

c)

d)

critical businesses and organization areas:
1.

What are the critical businesses and organizational areas?

2.

Which organizational areas provide the business and with what focus?

3.

What third party relationships and agreements exist?

4.

Are there any services that have been outsourced?

sensitive or valuable information:
1.

How long can the organization tolerate interruptions to each critical business process?

The preliminary ISMS scope can be determined by responding to the information above. This is also needed
in order to create a business case and overall ISMS project plan for management approval. The detailed
ISMS scope will be defined during the ISMS project.
The requirements noted in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 reference 4.2.1 a) outline the scope in terms of the
characteristics of the business, the organization, its location, assets and technology. The resulting information
from the above supports this determination.
Some topics which should be considered when making the initial decisions regarding scope include:
a)

What are the mandates for information security management established by organizational management
and the obligations imposed externally on the organization?

b)

Is the responsibility for the proposed in-scope systems held by more than one management team (e.g.
people in different subsidiaries or different departments)?

c)

How will the ISMS-related documents be communicated throughout the organization (e.g. on paper or
through the corporate intranet)?

d)

Can the current management systems support the organization’s needs? Is it fully operational, well
maintained, and functioning as intended?

Examples of management objectives that may be used as input to define the preliminary ISMS scope include:
a)

facilitating business continuity and disaster recovery

b)

improving resilience to incidents

c)

addressing legal/contractual compliance/liabilities

d)

enabling certification against other ISO/IEC standards

e)

enabling organizational evolution and position

f)

5.3

Define the preliminary ISMS scope

5.3.1

Develop the preliminary ISMS scope

Activity
The objectives to implement ISMS should include the preliminary ISMS scope definition, which is necessary
for the ISMS project.
Input
Output from Activity 5.2 Clarify the organization’s priorities to develop an ISMS.
Guidance
In order to execute the ISMS implementation project, the structure of an organization for the ISMS should be
defined. The preliminary scope of the ISMS should now be defined to provide management with guidance for
implementation decisions, and to support further activities.
The preliminary ISMS scope is needed in order to create the business case and the proposed project plan for
management approval.
The output from this stage will be a document defining the preliminary scope of the ISMS, which includes:
a)

a summary of the mandates for information security management established by organizational
management, and the obligations imposed externally on the organization;

b)

a description of how the area(s) in scope interact with other management systems;

c)

a list of the business objectives of information security management (as derived in clause 5.2);

d)

a list of critical business processes, systems, information assets, organizational structures and
geographic locations to which the ISMS will be applied.

e)

the relationship of existing management systems, regulatory, compliance, and organization objectives;

f)

the characteristics of the business, the organization, its location, assets and technology.

The common elements and the operational differences between the processes of any existing management
system(s) and the proposed ISMS should be identified.
Output
The deliverable is a document which describes the preliminary scope of the ISMS.

Other information
No other specific information.
NOTE
Special attention should be drawn that in case of certification specific documentation requirements of
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 as for the ISMS scope are to be fulfilled regardless of the management systems in place within the
organization.

5.3.2

Define roles & responsibilities for the preliminary ISMS scope

Activity
The overall roles and responsibilities for the preliminary ISMS scope should be defined.
Input
a)

output from Activity 5.3.1 Develop the preliminary ISMS scope

b)

list of stakeholders who will benefit from results of the ISMS project.

Guidance
In order to execute the ISMS project, the role of an organization for the project should be determined. The role
generally is different at each organization, because of the number of people dealing with information security.
The organizational structure and resources for information security vary with the size, type and structure of the
organization. For example, in a smaller organization, several roles may be carried out by the same person.
However, management should explicitly identify the role (typically Chief Information Security Officer,
Information Security Manager or similar) with overall responsibility for managing information security, and the
staff should be assigned roles and responsibilities based on the skill required to perform the job. This is critical
to ensure that the tasks are carried out efficiently and effectively.
The most important considerations in the definition of roles in information security management are:
a)

overall responsibility for the tasks remains at the management level,

b)

one person (usually the Chief Information Security Officer) is appointed to promote and co-ordinate the
information security process,

c)

each employee is equally responsible for his or her original task and for maintaining information security
in the workplace and in the organization.

The roles for managing information security should work together; this may be facilitated by an Information
Security Forum, or similar body.
Collaboration with appropriate business specialists should be undertaken (and documented) at all stages of
the development, implementation, operation and maintenance of the ISMS.
Representatives from departments within the identified scope (such as risk management) are potential ISMS
implementation team members. This team should be maintained at the smallest practical size for speed and
effective use of resources. Such areas are not only those directly included in the ISMS scope, but also the
indirect divisions, such as legal, risk management and administrative departments.
Output
The deliverable is a document or table describing the roles and responsibilities with the names and
organization needed to successfully implement an ISMS.
Other Information
Annex B provides details of roles and responsibilities needed in an organization to successfully implement an
ISMS.

5.4

Create the business case and the project plan for management approval

Activity
The management approval and commitment of resources for the ISMS implementation project should be
obtained by creating the business case and the ISMS project proposal.
Input
a)

output from Activity 5.2 Clarify the organization’s priorities to develop an ISMS

b)

output from Activity 5.3 Define the preliminary ISMS scope – The documented: preliminary
1.

ISMS scope and

2.

associated roles and responsibilities.

Guidance
The information for the business case and initial ISMS project plan should include estimated timeline,
resources, and milestones needed for the main activities noted in Clauses 6 to 9 of this International Standard.
The business case and initial ISMS project plan serve as the base of the project, but also ensures
management commitment and approval of resources needed for the ISMS implementation. The manner in
which the implemented ISMS will support the business objectives contributes to the effectiveness of the
organizational processes and increases the efficiency of the business.
The business case for implementing an ISMS should include short statements linked to the organization’s
objectives and cover the following subjects:
a)

goals and specific objectives

b)

benefit to the organization

c)

preliminary scope of ISMS including business processes affected

d)

critical processes & factors for reaching the ISMS objectives

e)

Individuals that effect, or are affected by, the ISMS should be identified and allowed adequate time to review
and comment on the ISMS business case and ISMS project proposal. The business case and ISMS project
proposal should be updated as necessary as input is provided. Once sufficient support is gained, the business
case and the ISMS project proposal should be presented to management for approval.
Management should approve the business case and initial project plan in order to achieve full organization
commitment and begin execution of the ISMS project.
The expected benefits from management commitment for implementing an ISMS are:
a)

knowledge and implementation of relevant laws, regulations, contractual obligations and standards
relating to information security, resulting in avoidance of liabilities and penalties of non-compliance,

b)

efficient use of multiple processes for information security,

c)

stability and increased confidence to grow through better management of information security risks,

d)

identification and protection of business-critical information.

Output
The deliverables of this activity are:
a)

a documented approval by management to execute the ISMS project with the allocated resources

b)

a documented business case

c)

an initial ISMS Project Proposal, with milestones, such as performing risk assessment, implementation,
internal audits, and management review)

Defining ISMS scope, boundaries and ISMS policy
Overview of defining ISMS scope, boundaries and ISMS policy

Management approval for the implementation of an ISMS is based on the preliminary ISMS scope, ISMS
business case and initial project plan. The detailed definition of the scope and boundaries of the ISMS, the
definition of the ISMS policy and acceptance and support by management are the key primary factors for
successful implementation of the ISMS.
Therefore, the objectives of this phase are:
Objectives:
To define the detailed scope and boundaries of the ISMS and develop the ISMS policy, and obtain
endorsement from management

In order to achieve "Define the detailed scope and boundaries for the ISMS" objective, the following activities
are necessary:
a)

define the organizational scope and boundaries,

b)

Information Communication Technology (ICT) scope and boundaries and

c)

physical scope and boundaries.

d)

specified characteristics in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 reference 4.2.1 a) and b), i.e. business, organization,
location, assets and technology aspects of the scope and boundaries, and policy are determined in the
process of defining these scope and boundaries

e)

integrate elementary scope and boundaries to obtain the ISMS scope and boundaries

To achieve the definition of the ISMS policy and obtain acceptance from the management, a single activity is
necessary.
To build an effective management system for the organization, the detailed scope of the ISMS should be
determined by considering critical information assets of the organization. It is important to have a common
terminology and systematic approach for identifying information assets and assessing viable security
mechanisms. This enables ease of communication and fosters consistent understanding through all phases of
the implementation. It is also important to ensure that critical organization areas are included in the scope.
It is possible to define the scope of an ISMS to encompass the entire organization, or a part thereof, such as a
division or clearly bounded subsidiary element. For example, in the case of "services" provided to customers,
the scope of the ISMS can be a service, or a cross-functional management system (an entire division or part
of a division). The requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2005 shall be fulfilled for certification regardless of the
existing management systems in place within the organization.
Organizational scope and boundaries, ICT scope and boundaries (6.3) and physical scope and boundaries
(6.4) are not always to be carried out sequentially. However it is useful to reference already obtained scope
and boundaries when defining other scope and boundaries.

Define organizational scope and boundaries

Activity
The organizational scope and boundaries should be defined.
Input
a)

b)

output from Activity 5.3 Define the preliminary ISMS scope - The documented preliminary scope of the
ISMS which addresses:
1.

relationship of existing management systems, regulatory, compliance, and organization objectives;

2.

characteristics of the business, the organization, its location, assets and technology.

output from Activity 5.2 Clarify the organization’s priorities to develop an ISMS - The documented
approval by management to implement an ISMS and start the project with necessary resources allocated.

Guidance
The amount of effort required to implement an ISMS is dependent on the magnitude of the scope to which it is
to be applied. This can also impact all activities relating to maintenance of information security of in-scope
items (such as process, physical locations, IT systems and people), including implementing and maintaining
controls,managing operations, and carrying out tasks such as identifying information assets and assessing
risk. If management decides to exclude certain parts of the organization from the scope of the ISMS, their
reasons for doing so should be documented.
When the scope of the ISMS is defined, it is important that its boundaries are clear enough to be explained to
those who were not involved in its definition.
Some controls relating to information security may already be in existence as a result of the deployment of
other management systems. These should be taken into account when planning the ISMS, but will not
necessarily indicate the boundaries of the scope for the current ISMS.
One method of defining organizational boundaries is to identify those areas of responsibility which are nonoverlapping to ease assignment of accountability within an organization.
Responsibilities directly related to information assets or business processes included in the ISMS scope
should be selected as a part of organization which is under control of the ISMS. While defining organizational
boundaries the following factors should be considered:
a)

ISMS management forum should consist of managers directly involved in the scope of the ISMS.

b)

the member of management responsible for the ISMS should be the one who is ultimately responsible for
all the areas of responsibility affected (i.e. their role will usually be dictated by their span of control and
responsibility within an organization).

c)

In the case where the role responsible for managing the ISMS is not a member of senior management, a
top management sponsor is essential to represent the interests of information security and act as the
advocate for the ISMS at the highest levels of the organization.

d)

Scope and boundaries need to be defined to ensure that all relevant assets are taken into account in the
risk assessment, and to address the risks that might arise through these boundaries.

Based on the approach, the organizational boundaries analyzed should identify all personnel affected by the
ISMS, and this should be included in the scope. The identification of personnel may be linked to processes
and/or functions depending on the selected approach. If some processes within the scope are outsourced to
the third parties those dependencies should be clearly documented. Such dependencies will be subjected to
further analysis in the ISMS implementation project.

Output
The deliverables of this activity are:
a)

description of organizational boundaries for the ISMS, including any justifications for portions of the
organization that have been excluded from the ISMS scope,

b)

functions and structure of those parts of the organization within the scope of the ISMS,

c)

identification of information exchanged within the scope and information exchanged through boundaries

d)

organization processes and the responsibilities for the information assets of the scope and outside scope,

Other information
No other specific information.

6.3

Define information communication technology (ICT) scope and boundaries

Activity
The scope and boundaries of the elements of information communication technology (ICT) and other
technology items covered by the ISMS should be defined.
Input
a)

output from Activity 5.3 Define the preliminary ISMS scope - The document for the preliminary scope of
the ISMS

b)

output from Activity 6.2 Define organizational scope and boundaries

Guidance
The definition of the ICT scope and boundaries can be obtained through an information system (rather than
IT-based) approach. Once there is a management decision to include the information system business
processes into the ISMS scope, all related ICT elements should be considered as well. This includes all parts
of the organization which store, process or transport critical information, assets, or which are critical to the
parts of the organization in-scope. Information systems may span organizational or national borders. Should
this be the case, the following should be considered:
a)

socio-cultural environment

b)

legal, regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to the organizations

c)

accountability for key responsibilities

d)

technical constraints (e.g. available bandwidth, availability of service, etc.)

Taking the above into consideration, ICT boundaries should include a description of the following when
applicable
a)

the communications infrastructure, where responsibility for managing it is held by the organization
including various different technologies (e.g. wireless, wireline, or data/voice networks).

b)

software within the organizational boundaries, that is used and controlled by the organization

c)

ICT hardware required by the network or networks, applications or production systems

d)

roles and responsibilities regarding ICT hardware, network and software

If any one or more of the above bullets is not controlled by the organization, third-party dependencies should
be documented. See 6.2, Guidance.
Output
The deliverables of this activity are:
a)

information exchanged within the scope and information exchanged through boundaries

b)

ICT boundaries for the ISMS, including any justifications for the exclusion of ICT under the organization’s
management that have been excluded from the ISMS scope,

c)

the information systems and telecommunication networks, describing what is in scope, along with roles
and responsibilities for these systems. Out-of-scope systems should be briefly summarised

Other information
No other specific information

6.4

Define physical scope and boundaries

Activity
The physical scope and boundaries that should be covered by the ISMS should be defined.
Input
a)

output from Activity 5.3 Define the preliminary ISMS scope - The document for the preliminary scope of
the ISMS

b)

output from Activity 6.2 Define organizational scope and boundaries .

c)

output from Activity 6.3 Define information communication technology (ICT) scope and boundaries

Guidance
The definition of physical scope and boundaries consists of identifying premises, locations or facilities within
an organization which should be part of the ISMS. It is more complex to deal with information systems, which
cross physical borders that need:
a)

remote facilities

b)

interfaces to the customer’s information systems and services provided by third party service

c)

applicable proper interfaces and service levels.

Taking the above into consideration, physical boundaries should include a description of the following, when
applicable:
a)

functions or process description taking into account their physical location and extent the organization
controls them

b)

special facilities used for storing/containing ICT hardware or in-scope data (e.g. on back-up tapes) based
upon the coverage of the ICT boundaries

If any one or more of the above bullets is not controlled by the organization, third-party dependencies should
be documented. See 6.2, Guidance.

the ISMS

b)

output from Activity 6.2 Define organizational scope and boundaries

c)

output from Activity 6.3 Define information communication technology (ICT) scope and boundaries

d)

output from Activity 6.4 Define physical scope and boundaries

Guidance
The scope of an ISMS can be described and justified in many ways. For example, a physical location such as
a datacenter or office may be selected, and critical processes listed; each of which involve areas outside that
datacenter bringing those outside areas into scope. One such critical process could, for example, be mobile
access to a central information system.
Output
The deliverable of this activity is a document describing the scope and boundaries of the ISMS, containing the
following information:
a)

the key characteristics of the organization (its function, structure, services, assets, and the scope and
boundaries of the responsibility for each asset)

Conducting information security requirements analysis
Overview of conducting information security requirements analysis

The analysis of the current situation in the organization is important, as there are existing requirements and
information assets that should be considered when implementing an ISMS. The activities described in this
phase can be undertaken mainly in parallel with those described in Clause 6 for reasons of efficiency and
practicality.
Objectives:
To define the relevant requirements to be supported by the ISMS, identify the information assets, and obtain
the current information security status within scope
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 reference: 4.2.1.c)1) partially, 4.2.1. d), 4.2.1. e)

The information collected through the information security analysis should:
a)

provide management with a starting point (i.e. correct basic data)

b)

identify and document conditions for the implementation

c)

provide a clear and well-established understanding of the organization’s facilities

d)

consider the particular circumstances and situation of the organization

e)

identify the desired level of protection for the information

f)

determine the compilation of information needed for all or part of an enterprise within the proposed scope
of the implementation.

7.2

Define information security requirements for the ISMS process

Activity
The detailed information security requirements for the ISMS process should be analyzed and defined.
Input
a)

output from Activity 5.2 Clarify the organization’s priorities to develop an ISMS – The documents:
1.

summarizing the objectives, information security priorities, and organization requirements for ISMS

2.

list of regulatory, contractual, and industry constraints relevant to the information security of the
organization

b)

output from Activity 6.5 Integrate each scope and boundaries to obtain the ISMS scope and boundaries The scope and boundaries of the ISMS

c)

output from Activity 6.6 Develop the ISMS policy and obtain approval from management – The ISMS
policy

Guidance
The first step requires all supporting information for the ISMS to be collected. For each organizational process
and specialist task, a decision needs to be made in terms of how critical the information is, i.e. the level of
protection required. A variety of internal conditions may affect information security, and these should be
determined. At this early stage it is not important to describe the information technology in detail. There should
be a basic summary of the information analyzed for an organization process and the associated ICT
applications and systems.
The analysis of the organization’s processes provides statements about the effects of information security
incidents on the organization’s activity. In many cases it is adequate to work with a very basic description of
the organization’s processes. The processes, functions, locations, information systems and communications
networks need to be identified and documented, if they have not already been included as part of the ISMS
scope.
The following should be addressed to get the detailed information security requirements for the ISMS:
a)

preliminary identification of important information assets and their current information security protection.

b)

identify visions of the organization and determine the effect of identified visions on future information
processing requirements.

c)

analyze the current forms of information processing, system applications, communication networks,
location of activities and IT resources, etc.

d)

identify all essential requirements (e.g. legal and regulatory requirements, contractual obligations,
organization requirements, industry standards, customer and supplier agreements, insurance conditions
etc.).

e)

identify the level of information security awareness and, from that, derive the training and education
requirements, in terms of each operational and administrative unit.

Conduct an information security assessment

Activity
The information security assessment should be performed by comparing the current status of information
security of the organization compared to the desired organization objectives.
Input
a)

output from Activity 6.5 Integrate each scope and boundaries to obtain the ISMS scope and boundaries The scope and boundaries of the ISMS

b)

output from Activity 6.6 Develop the ISMS policy and obtain approval from management – The ISMS
policy

c)

output from Activity 7.2 Define information security requirements for the ISMS process

d)

output from Activity 7.3 Identify assets within the ISMS scope

Guidance
Information security assessment is the activity for identifying the existing level of information security (i.e. the
organization current procedures of handling protection of information). The fundamental purpose of the
information security assessment is to provide information supporting the description required for the
management system in the form of policy and guidelines. It is of course necessary to make sure that the
identified deficiencies are dealt with in parallel via a prioritized action plan. All parties involved should be
familiar with the results of the organization analysis, standards documents, and have access to suitable
management personnel.
Information security assessments analyse current situation for the organization by using the following
information and determine current status of information security and document vulnerabilities:
a)

studying background facts based upon critical processes

b)

information assets classification

c)

organizational information security requirement.

The results of the information security assessment together with the objectives of the organization are often
an important part of the incentive for future work on information security. The information security assessment
should be performed by an internal or external resource with an independent status in relation to the
organization.
Participation in the information security assessment should include individuals who possess a strong
knowledge of the current environment, conditions, and what is relevant in terms of information security. These
individuals should be selected to represent a broad spectrum across the organization and include:
a)

line managers (e.g. organization unit heads)

b)

process owners (i.e. representing important organization areas)

c)

other individuals who possess strong knowledge of the current environment, conditions, and what is
relevant in terms of information security. For example, business process users and operational,
administrative functions and legal functions.

The following actions are important for successful information security assessment:
a)

Identify and list the relevant standards of the organization (e.g. ISO/IEC 27002:2005).

b)

identify known control requirements that arise from policies, legal and regulatory requirements,
contractual obligations, findings from past audits, or findings from risk assessments done in the past.

c)

use these as reference documents in order for a rough estimation to be made of the organization's
current requirements concerning its level of information security.

ISO/IEC 27003:2010(E)

The prioritization made in connection with the organization analysis constitutes the foundation for which
security precautions and checks (controls) should be considered.
The approach for conducting the information security assessment is as follows:
a)

select the important organizational business processes and process steps concerning information
security requirements,

b)

create a comprehensive flow chart covering the organization’s main processes including infrastructure
(logical and technical), if this is not already present or performed during the organization analysis.

c)

discuss with suitable key personnel and analyze the organization’s current situation in relation to the
information security requirements. For example which processes are critical, how well do they currently
work? (The results are used later in the risk assessment.)

d)

determine control deficiencies by comparing existing controls with previously identified control
requirements.

e)

complete and document the current status.

Output
The deliverable of this activity is:
a)

a document summarizing the assessed security status of the organization, and evaluated vulnerabilities.

Other information
The information security assessment conducted at this stage will only deliver preliminary information about the
organization's status of information security and vulnerabilities, because the full set of information security
policies and standards is developed at a later stage (see Clause 9), and a risk assessment has not yet been
conducted.

Conducting risk assessment and planning risk treatment
Overview of conducting risk assessment and planning risk treatment

The implementation of an ISMS should address relevant information security risks. The identification,
evaluation and planned treatment of the risks and the selection of control objectives and controls are
important steps for an ISMS implementation and should be handled in this phase.
ISO/IEC 27005:2008 provides specific guidelines for Information Security Risk Management and should be
referred to throughout Clause 8.
It is assumed that management has committed to the implementation of the ISMS, and that the ISMS scope
and ISMS policy have been defined, and that information assets are known as well as the information security
assessment results.
Objective:
To define the risk assessment methodology, identify, analyze and evaluate the information security risks for
selecting risk treatment options and selecting control objectives and controls

identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited by threats, to cause harm to assets or to the organization

d)

identify the consequences that losses of confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, and other
security requirements may have on the assets

e)

assess the business impact that might result from anticipated or actual information security incidents

f)

assess the likelihood of the incident scenarios

g)

estimate the level of risk

h)

compare levels of risk against risk evaluation criteria and risk acceptance criteria

Participation in the risk assessment should include individuals who possess a strong knowledge of the
organization’s objectives, and security understanding (e.g. good insight into what is currently relevant in terms
of threats to the organization’s objectives). These individuals should be selected to represent a broad
spectrum across the organization. For reference, see Annex B, ‘Roles and Responsibilities’.
An organization may employ a risk assessment methodology that is project-specific, company-specific or a
sector specific standard.

ISO/IEC 27002:2005

Guidance
It is important to specify the relation between the risks and the selected options for treating them (e.g. a risk
treatment plan), as this will provide a summary of risk treatment. Possible options for the treatment of risks are
enumerated in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 reference 4.2.1 f).
The ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Annex A (normative) “Control objectives and controls" is used to select control
objectives and controls for risk treatment. If there are no appropriate control objectives or controls in Annex A,
the additional control objectives and controls should be specified and used. It is important to demonstrate how
the selected controls will mitigate risks as required by the risk treatment plan.
The data given in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Annex A is not meant to be exhaustive. Sector-specific controls may
be identified to support the specific needs of the business as well as the ISMS.
In the case of risk reduction, managing the relationship between each risk and selected control objectives and
controls is beneficial to designing the ISMS implementation. It could be added to the list that describes the
relationship between the risks and the selected options for risk treatment.
To facilitate audits, the organization should compile a list of controls which have been selected as relevant
and applicable to the organization's ISMS. This has the added advantage of improving business relationships,
such as electronic outsourcing, by providing a summary of controls in place.
It is important to be aware of that the summary of controls is very likely to contain sensitive information.
Therefore, appropriate care should be taken when making the summary of controls available to both internal
and external recipients. It may actually be appropriate to take the information generated as part of the creation
of the ISMS into account during the definition of assets.
Output
The deliverables of this activity are:
a)

a list with selected controls and control objectives

b)

security management efforts. The level of details in which controls are specified should meet the requirements
needed to support the organization’s management approval for the ISMS.
Approval should be obtained from high-level management for the decision to accept residual risks, and
authorisation obtained for the actual operation of the ISMS. These decisions should be based upon an
assessment of the risks and opportunities likely to occur as a result of the implementation of the ISMS, as
compared with those resulting from not implementing it.

Designing the ISMS
Overview of designing the ISMS

A detailed design of the ISMS project, planned activities for its implementation should now be developed. The
final ISMS project plan will be unique in its detail for the specific organization, depending on results from
previous activities as well as the results of the specific activities in the design phase described in this clause.
The specific final ISMS project implementation plan is the output of this clause. Based upon this plan, the
ISMS project can be launched in the organization as part of the very first “DO” phase of the PDCA cycle as
described in ISO/IEC 27001:2005.
It is assumed that management has committed to the implementation of the ISMS which is defined in the
ISMS scope and ISMS policy. The information assets as well as the results of the information security
assessment are assumed to be available. In addition, the risk treatment plan describing the risks, risk
treatment options, with the identified selected control objectives and controls should also be available.
The ISMS design described here focuses upon the internal structure and requirements of the ISMS. It should
be noted that, in certain cases, the ISMS design may have a direct or indirect impact on the design of
business processes. Likewise it should be noted that there is usually a need to integrate ISMS components
with pre-existing management and infrastructure arrangements.
Objective:
To complete the final implementation plan for the ISMS by: designing organizational security based on the
selected risk treatment options, as well as requirements regarding recording and documents , and designing
the controls integrating security provisions for ICT, physical and organizational processes, and designing the
ISMS-specific requirements

In designing the ISMS, the following matters should be considered:
a)

organizational security – covers the administrative aspects of information security including the
responsibility of the organization’s operation for risk treatment. This should be formed into the set of
activities resulting in the policies, objectives, processes and procedures to handle and improve
information security in relation to the organization’s needs and risks.

b)

ICT security – covers aspects of information security specifically related to the responsibility of the ICT
operations for risk reduction. This is to fulfil the requirements set by the organization and the technical
implementation of controls to reduce risks.

c)

physical security – covers aspects of information security specifically related to the responsibility of the
handling of the physical environment, such as buildings and their infrastructure for risk reduction. This is
to fulfil the requirements set by the organization and the technical implementation of controls to reduce
risks.

d)

ISMS specific – covers the aspects of the different specific requirements for an ISMS according to
ISO/IEC 27001:2005, apart from what is covered in the other three areas. The focus is on certain
activities that should be conducted in the implementation to achieve an operational ISMS which are:
1.

monitoring

2.

measuring

3.

internal ISMS auditing

4.

training and awareness

5.

incident management

6.

management review

7.

ISMS improvement including corrective and preventive actions

The development of the ISMS Project and the design of its related planned implementation of controls should
involve and make use of the skills and experience of staff from those parts of the organization that are either
within the ISMS scope or have ISMS related management responsibilities. The ISMS specific aspects requires
dialogue with management.
To design the selected controls for the risk treatment, it is crucial to design the ICT and physical security
environment and the organizational security environment. ICT security deals not only with information systems
and networks but also with operational requirements. Physical security deals with all aspects of access control,
non-repudiation, physical protection of information assets and what is stored or kept in, as well as being itself
a means of protection for security controls itself.
The controls selected in activities described in clause 8.3 should be implemented according to a specific
structured and detailed implementation plan, as part of the ISMS project plan. This specific part of the ISMS
project plan should address how to handle each risk in order to achieve the control objectives. This specific
part of the ISMS project plan is essential if the selected controls are to be properly and effectively
implemented. The information security management team is responsible for drawing up this specific part of
the implementation plan, which then constitutes the final ISMS project plan.

ISO/IEC 27002:2005

Guidance
The design of organizational structures and processes for internal ISMS operations should seek to build upon
and integrate with pre-existing areas where appropriate. Likewise, the integration of the ISMS into broader
pre-existing management structures (e.g. internal audit) should be taken into account in the ISMS design
process.
The organizational structure designed for the ISMS should reflect activities for implementation and operation
of ISMS as well, addressing, for example, the methods of monitoring and recording as a part of the ISMS
operations.
Accordingly, the structure for ISMS operations should be designed based on the planned ISMS
implementation by considering the following:
a)

Is each role for ISMS implementation needed for ISMS operations?

b)

Are the defined roles different from those for ISMS implementation?

c)

What roles should be added for ISMS implementation?

For example, the following roles may be added for ISMS operations:
a)

someone responsible for information security operations in each department

b)

someone responsible for measuring the ISMS in each department

documenting the ISMS, roles involved, data formats, and reporting paths for the management

b)

design the documentation requirements

c)

design the recording requirements

The ISMS documentation should include records of management decisions; ensure that actions are traceable
to management decisions and policies, and that the recorded results are reproducible.
ISMS documents should provide the evidence that controls are selected based on the results of risk
assessment and risk treatment, and that such processes are implemented along with the ISMS policy and
objectives.
Documentation is essential for the reproducibility of results and procedures. As for selected controls, the
establishment and documentation of the procedures should have a reference to the person responsible for the
actual piece of documentation.

The ISMS documentation should include the documentation as specified in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 reference:
4.3.1.
It is necessary for the ISMS documents to be managed and made available to personnel as required. This
includes the following:
a) establish the administrative procedure of the ISMS document management
b) a formal approval of documents for adequacy prior to issue
c) ensuring that changes and the current revision status of documents are identified
d) protection and control the documents as an information asset of the organization
It is important that relevant versions of applicable documents are available at points of use, ensuring that
documents remain legible, readily identifiable, transferred, stored and ultimately, disposed of in accordance
with the procedures applicable to their classification.
In addition, ensuring that documents of external origin are identified, that the distribution of documents is
controlled, preventing the unintended use of obsolete documents, and applying suitable tracking to them if
they are retained for any purpose.
Records should be created, maintained and controlled as evidence that the ISMS of the organization
conforms to ISO/IEC 27001:2005, and to show the effectiveness of operations.
It is also required to keep records of implementation status for the entire PDCA phase, as well as records of
information security incidents and events, records of education, training, skills, experience and qualifications,
internal ISMS audits, corrective and preventive actions, and organizational records.
The following tasks should be performed to control records:
a)

document the controls required to identify, store, protect, search, and discard data, and document its
storage duration

b)

define what should be recorded, and to what extent, in the operational management processes

c)

when any period of retention is specified by relevant laws or legislation, the period of retention should be
set pursuant to such legal requirement.

Guidance
The information security policy documents the organization’s strategic position with respect to the information
security objectives throughout the organization.
The policy is drawn up based on the information and knowledge. What has been identified by management as
important in the previously conducted analysis should be made evident and emphasized in the policy in order
to provide incentive and motivation in the organization. It is also important to point out what happens if the
policy is not followed. Laws and regulatory impacts that affect the organization in question should also be
emphasized.
Examples of an information security policy can be drawn from reference literature, the Internet, interest
associations and industry associations. Formulations and overtones can be drawn from annual reports, other
policy documents or other documents that management supports.
There may be different interpretations and requirements regarding the actual size of a policy. It should be
sufficiently summarized, so that the staff is able to understand the intent of the policy. In addition, it should
sufficiently distinguish what objectives are needed to address the set of regulations and organization
objectives.
The size and structure of the information security policy should support the documents that are used in the
next stage in the process for introducing an information security management system (see also appendix D Information about policy structure).
For large and complex organizations (e.g. with widely differing operational areas) it may be necessary to draw
up an overall policy and a number of underlying operationally adapted policies.
Guidance on the content of an information security policy document is provided in ISO/IEC 27002:2005

The proposed policy (with the version number and date) should be cross-checked and established within the
organization by the operational manager. Following establishment within the management group or equivalent,
the operational manager approves the information security policy. It is then communicated to everyone in the
organization in such a way that it is relevant, accessible and understandable for its readers.

standards as well as the set of applicable legal and regulatory requirements should be available to those who
need to know.
Representatives of different parts of the organization covered by the scope of the ISMS should participate in
the process of developing standards and procedures. Those participating should have authority and be
representative of the organization. For example, the following roles may be included:
a)

information security managers,

b)

representatives for physical security,

c)

information Systems owners, and

d)

process owners of strategic and operational areas.

It is suggested to keep the editorial group as small as possible, with the option of appointing specialists to the
team on a temporary basis as required. Each representative should liaise actively with their own area of the
organization to provide seamless operational support. This then facilitates later refinement in the form of
procedures and routines at the operational level.
Security standards and procedures should then be used as a basis for designing detailed technical or
operational procedures.
A useful way to approach the development of information security standards and procedures is to consider
each point of implementation guidance in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and ISO/IEC 27002:2005 that is deemed
applicable (based on the results of the risk assessment), and describe precisely how it should be applied.
An evaluation of any existing information security standards and procedures should be reviewed. For example,
can they be refined and developed, or are do they need to be entirely replaced?
Relevant and up to date documentation should be provided to every member of staff in scope. The information
security standards and procedures should apply to the entire organization or make it clear as to which roles,
systems and areas are covered. A first version should be produced in a timely manner
The revision and review process should be defined at an early stage. A strategy should then be drawn up for
how information on policy changes should be distributed.

In this activity the following should be documented for each control, which should be a part of the ISMS project
plan:
a)

name of the person responsible for implementation of a control

b)

priority of the control to be implemented

c)

tasks or activities to implement controls

d)

statement of the time by which the control should have been implemented

e)

person to whom implementation of the control should be reported, once complete

f)

resources for implementation (manpower, resource requirements, space requirements, costs)

Initially, the ICT and physical security should be conceptually designed. The following should be considered:
Responsibilities for the initial implementation process generally include:
a)

specification of control objectives with a description of the expected planned state

b)

allocation of resources (workload, financial resources)

c)

realistic time target for implementation of the control

d)

integration options with ICT , physical and organizational security

After the conceptual design, actual design such as system development in order to achieve and implement the
best practice for the organization should be done. The following should be considered:
Responsibilities for the actual implementation process include:
a)

design for each of the selected controls for ICT, physical and organizational areas at operational level of
the workplace

b)

Instantiation of each control according to the agreed design

c)

provision of procedures and information for security awareness promotion controls and training courses

d)

provision of aids and implementation of the controls at the workplace

Depending on the type of controls (ICT, physical or organizational); it may not always be appropriate or
necessary to draw a clear-cut line between the initial part and the final part of the implementation process.
The implementation of controls frequently requires cooperation between several different roles within an
organization. Thus, for example, persons with system responsibility will be needed to procure, install and
maintain technical facilities. Other roles for may be better suited to devising and documenting procedures
governing the use of systems.

Information security should be integrated in organization-wide procedures and processes. If this proves
difficult for a part of the organization, or a third party, to implement, the relevant parties should communicate
this immediately so that a resolution can be agreed upon. Solutions to this type of issue include modifying the
procedures and processes, reallocating roles and responsibilities and adapting technical procedures.
The following are the results of implementing ISMS controls.
a)

Implementation plan which specifies details of the implementation of controls, such as schedule, structure
of implementing team and so on

b)

Guidance
Management review of ISMS activities should begin at the earliest stages of ISMS specification and business
case development and continue through to the regular review of ISMS operations. This close involvement
provides a means to validate the ISMS against the needs of the business and to maintain the commitment of
the business to the ISMS.
The planning of management reviews includes establishing when and how the management reviews should
be conducted. Detailed information regarding prerequisites for management reviews is given in sub-clause 7.2
of ISO/IEC 27001:2005.
To plan the review, an assessment of which roles to involve has to be made. Management approval should be
sought for the choice of roles, and these roles should then be informed as early as possible. It is advisable to
provide management with adequate data regarding the necessity for, and purpose of, the review process.
(See Annex B for further information about roles and responsibilities.)
Management reviews should be based upon results from ISMS measurements and other information collected
during the operation of the ISMS. This information is used by the activities of ISMS management to determine
the maturity and effectiveness of the ISMS. Required inputs and outputs to ISMS measurements are given in
ISO/IEC 27001:2005, and further information on ISMS measurements is available in Annex E
and ISO/IEC 27004:2009.
It should also be noted that this should include a review of the methodology and results of risk assessment.
This should take place at planned intervals, taking into consideration any changes in the environment, such as
organization and technology.
Planning for the internal ISMS audit should be done in order to be able to regularly evaluate the ISMS once it
has been implemented. The results of the internal ISMS audit are important inputs of ISMS management
review. Therefore, before management review is executed, internal ISMS audit should be planned. The
internal ISMS audit should include the perspective whether the control objectives, controls, processes and
procedures of the ISMS are effectively implemented and maintained and conform to:
a)

the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2005,

b)

relevant legislation or regulations, and

c)

the identified information security requirements,

(See Annex C for further information about planning auditing.)
Preconditions of management reviews are the information collected based on the implemented and operated
ISMS. The information provided to a management review team may include the following:
a)

Incident reports for the last period of operation

b)

Verification of control effectiveness and identified non-conformity

c)

The results of other regular checks (more detail if the checks have revealed non-compliances with policy).

d)

Recommendations for improvement of the ISMS.

A plan for monitoring should document the monitoring results that should be recorded and reported to
management, (for additional information on monitoring see Annex E).

overview of the organization´s general education and training program

Guidance
Management is responsible for carrying out education and training to ensure that all personnel who are
allocated a clearly defined role have the competence to perform the operations required. Ideally, the content
of the education and training performed should help all personnel be aware of and understand the meaning
and importance of the information security activities they are involved in, and how they can contribute to
achieving the goals of the ISMS.
It is important to ensure at this point that every employee within the ISMS scope receives the necessary
security training and/or education. In large organizations, a single body of training material is generally not
sufficient, as it will contain too much data which is relevant only to specific types of job, and therefore will be
large, complex and hard to use. In these cases, it is usually appropriate to have different sets of training
material designed for each broad type of role, such as office workers, IT staff or drivers, which is customised
to their specific needs.”

ISO/IEC 27003:2010(E)

An information security awareness training and education program should ensure that records of security
training and education are generated. These records should regularly be reviewed to ensure that all personnel
have received the training that they require. A role should be made responsible for this process.
Information security training materials should be designed to tie in with other training materials used by the
organization, especially training courses provided to users of IT systems. Training in relevant aspects of
information security should ideally be integrated into every course for IT users.
Information security training material should contain the following points as a minimum, as appropriate to the
target audience:
a)

risks and threats regarding information security

b)

basic terms of information security

c)

clear definition of a security incident: guidance as to how one may be identified and how it should be dealt
with and reported

d)

information security policy, standards and procedures of the organization

e)

responsibilities and reporting channels relating to information security in the organization

f)

guidance on how to assist in improving information security

g)

guidance on information security incidents and reporting

h)

where to obtain further information.

An information security training team should be determined which may include the following tasks:
a)

creating and managing training records

b)

creating and managing training materials,

c)

carrying out training

These tasks may be allocated using existing training staff. But the existing staff may require substantial
training in information security concepts to ensure that these are presented effectively and accurately.
An information security awareness, training and education program should include a procedure to ensure that
the training materials are reviewed and updated regularly. A role should be made explicitly responsible for
reviewing and updating training materials.
Output
The deliverables of this activity are:
a)

information security awareness, education and training materials

b)

formation of information security awareness education and training, including roles and responsibilities

c)

plans for information security awareness, education and training

d)

actual records showing the results of information security awareness, education and training of
employees

Guidance
The activities required to implement selected controls and carry out other ISMS related activities should be
formalized in a detailed implementation plan as part of the final ISMS project. The detailed implementation
plan may also be supported by descriptions of proposed implementation tools and methods. As an ISMS
Project involves many different roles in the organization, it is important that the activities are clearly assigned
to responsible parties, and that the plan is communicated both early in the project, and throughout the
organization.
As with all projects, it is of course essential that the person responsible for the project ensures that sufficient
resources have been allocated to the project.
Output
The deliverable of this activity is the final ISMS project implementation plan.

Annex B
(informative)
Roles and responsibilities for Information Security

This annex provides additional guidance on roles and responsibility within an organization related to
information security. The roles are first given in the organizational view for implementing an ISMS. A table
summarizes this information and presents general examples of roles and responsibilities.
1. Role of the Information Security Committee
The information security committee should have a leading role for the ISMS in an organization. The
information security committee should be responsible for handling the organization’s information assets, and
should have a sufficient understanding of information security for directing, monitoring, and completing
necessary tasks.
The following are examples of possible information security committee roles:
a)

Completion of risk management, establishing the plan for the ISMS documents, being responsible for
determining the contents of these documents and acquiring acceptance from the management

b)

Planning the purchase of new equipment and/or deciding the reuse of existing equipment that the
organization already possesses

c)

Handling any problems that may arise

d)

Considering improvements arising from following implementation and measurement of the ISMS

e)

Give strategic direction to the ISMS (both during the implementation project and in operation), and

f)

liaison between senior management and the implementation project team and information security people.

2. Roles for the Information Security Planning Team
The project team responsible for the ISMS, when planning the project, should be assisted by members who
have a broad understanding of the important information assets within the ISMS scope, and have enough
knowledge to consider how to handle this information. For example, when determining how to handle
information assets, there might be different opinions among departments within the ISMS scope, so there
might be a need to adjust the positive and negative effects of the plan. The project team is required to work as
a coordinator of conflicts across departmental boundaries. To do this, its members need communication skills
founded on their experiences and coordination abilities, as well as high levels of knowledge about security.
3. Specialists and External Consultants
An organization should select members for the duties above (if possible, members with one exclusive role)
before establishing the ISMS. However, the members need to have broad knowledge and experience in the
field of information security such as "IT," "managerial decisions" and "an understanding of the organization”.
The people responsible for given operations in an organization may know their specific fields best. The many
specialists who are experts in specific fields in their organization should be referred to in terms of ISMS as it
relates to use in their specific fields. It is important to also have a balance of this expertise with the broad
knowledge needed to meet the organization objectives. External consultants can give advice based on their
macroscopic points of view of an organization and experience from other similar occasions, even though they
generally do not necessarily have in depth knowledge about the organization’s specifics and operational
details of an organization. The terms that are used in the above examples, such as the Information Security
Committee and the Information Security Planning Team, are not important. Only the function of each structure

Single user licence only, copying and networking prohibited

51

ISO/IEC 27003:2010(E)

should be understood. Ideally there should be internal structures to coordinate the organization’s information
security, communicating and working closely with each technical department.
4. Information Asset owners
A person should be appointed for each organization process and specialist application; this person acts as the
so-called "information asset owner" for all information security issues relating to processing data within this
particular organization process. The contact person or process owner is responsible, for example, for
delegating tasks and handling information within the organization processes to which they have been
assigned.
In case of risk sharing, risk avoidance and risk retention, the necessary actions should be taken from the
organizational security aspects. If the decision has been made to transfer risks, the appropriate actions should
be taken, using contracts, insurance arrangements and organizational structure such as partnership and joint
ventures.
Figure B.1 shows an example of the organizational structure for establishing the ISMS. The main roles and
responsibilities of the organization given below are based on this example.

Interaction with the organization
All parties involved should review and become very familiar with the current requirements for protecting the
organization’s assets. Participation in organizational analysis should include individuals who possess a strong
knowledge of the organization and the environment in which it operates. These individuals should be selected
to represent a broad spectrum across the organization and include:
a)

senior management (e.g. COO and CFO)

b)

members of the Information Security Committee

c)

members of the Information Security Planning Team

d)

line managers (e.g. organization unit heads)

Examples of general roles and responsibilities related to information security
Information security is a wide area that affects the whole organization. As such, clearly defined security
responsibilities are essential for a successful implementation. As security related roles and responsibilities
vary, an understanding of the different roles is fundamental for understanding some of the activities described
later in this International Standard. The table below outlines security related roles and responsibilities. It
should be noted that these roles are general, and specific descriptions are needed for each individual
implementation of an ISMS.

Stakeholder

In the context of the other roles’ descriptions concerning
information security, the stakeholder is primarily here defined as
persons/bodies outside the normal operations – such as the
board, owners (both in terms of organizational owners if the
organization is part of a group or a government organization,
and/or direct owners such as shareholders in a private
organization). Other examples of stakeholders could be affiliated
companies, clients, suppliers or more public organizations such
as governmental financial control agencies or relevant stock
exchange, if the organization is listed.

Role

Brief Description of Responsibility

Archive

All organizations have archives containing vital information that
needs to be stored for the long term. The information may be
located on multiple types of media and a specific person should
be responsible for the security of this storage.

Personal Data

If required by national law, there may be a person responsible for
being the contact for data inspection board or similar official
organization that oversees personal integrity and privacy issues.

System developer

If an organization develops their own information systems,
someone has the responsibility for this development.

Specialist / Expert

The specialists and experts responsible for some operations in an
organization should be referred to in terms of their intention about
ISMS matters as it relates to use in their specific fields.

External Consultant

External consultants can give advice based on their macroscopic
points of view of an organization and industry experience.
However, consultants may not have the depth knowledge of the
organization and operations of the organization.

Employee / Staff / User

Each employee is equally responsible for maintaining information
security in the workplace and in his/her environment.

Auditor

The auditor is responsible for assessing and evaluating the ISMS.

Trainer

The trainer implements training and awareness programs.

Local IT or IS responsible

In a larger organization there is often somebody in the local
organization that has local responsibility for IT matters, and
possibly for information security as well.

Champion (Influential Person)

This is not a responsible role as such, but in a larger organization
it may be of great help in the implementing stage to have people
who have a deep knowledge about the implementation of an
ISMS and can support the understanding and reasons behind the
implementation. They may influence the opinion in a positive way
and may also be called “Ambassadors”.

Annex C
(informative)
Information about Internal Auditing

This Annex provides additional guidance to support the planning of auditing.
The implementation of an ISMS should be evaluated at regular intervals by means of internal and independent
audits. These also serve the purpose of collating and evaluating the experiences made in day-to-day practice.
In order to implement an ISMS the forms for auditing have to be planned.
In an ISMS audit, auditing results should be determined based on evidence. Therefore, some suitable length
of time during the ISMS operations should be allocated to collecting suitable evidence.
An internal ISMS audit should be implemented and executed regularly to evaluate whether the control
objectives, controls, processes and procedures of the ISMS conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001
and relevant legislation or regulations, conform to the identified information security requirements, and are
effectively implemented and maintained.
However, selecting the internal ISMS auditors may be difficult for small companies. If not enough resources
are available to have these kinds of audits performed by experienced internal members of staff, external
experts should instead be charged with carrying out auditing activities.When organizations use external
auditors, the following should be considered: external auditors are themselves familiar with the internal ISMS
audits; however they may not have enough knowledge about the organizational environment of the
organization. This information should be supplied by internal staff. On the other hand, internal auditors may be
able to perform detailed audits considering the organization’s organizational environment, but may not have
enough knowledge about performing ISMS audits. Organizations should recognize the characteristics and
potential shortcomings of internal vs. external auditors carrying out the internal ISMS audits.
The effectiveness and efficiency of the implemented controls (see ISO/IEC 27004:2009) should be examined
within the scope of internal audits.
It is important that none of the audits are carried out by those individuals who were involved in the planning
and design of the security objectives, because it is difficult to find one's own mistakes. Therefore, Organization
units or individuals that are outside the scope of internal ISMS audits should be selected as the auditors by
management. These auditors should plan, carry out and make reports and follow-up of the internal ISMS
audits to acquire the commitment of management. Depending on the size of the organization, it might be
useful to call in external auditors to avoid the situation in which staff members become blinkered to their own
work.
In an internal ISMS audit, it should be checked that the ISMS is being operated effectively and maintained and
as expected. Auditors should take the status and importance of management goals, controls, processes and
procedures to be audited into account when planning an audit program, as well as the results of previous
audits.
In carrying out an audit, the criteria, applicable scope, frequency and method of the audit should be
documented.
The objectivity and fairness of the audit process should be ensured when auditors are selected. An auditor is
required to have the following competences when carrying out the series of processes in the audit:
a)

Planning and carrying out the audit

b)

Reporting the results

c)

Proposing corrective and preventive action, etc.

ISO/IEC 27003:2010(E)

In addition, the organization is required to define the responsibilities of auditors and the series of processes for
the audit in the procedure documentation.
A manager who is responsible for a process being audited should ensure that nonconformities and their
causes are appropriately addressed without delay. However, this does not mean that the nonconformity
necessarily needs to be corrected immediately. In addition, the corrective actions performed should include a
verification of the action that has been taken and a report of the results of verification.
From the viewpoint of governance, the internal ISMS audit can be performed effectively as a part of, or in
collaboration with, other internal audits of the organization. When performing the audit, it is a good idea to
refer to "Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of ISMS ISO/IEC 27006:2007”.

Annex D
(informative)
Structure of policies

This annex provides additional guidance on the structure of policies including the information security policy.
In general, a policy is statement of overall intention and direction as formally expressed by management (see
FCD 27000 and ISO/IEC 27002). The content of a policy guides actions and decisions concerning the topic of
the policy. An organization may have a number of policies; one for each of the activity areas that is important
to the organization. Some policies are independent of each other, while other policies have a hierarchical
relationship. In the area of security, policies are commonly organized hierarchically. Typically, the
organization’s security policy is the highest level policy. This is supported by a range of more specific policies,
including the information security policy and the Information Security Management System policy. In turn the
information security policy can be supported by a number of more detailed policies on specific topics related to
aspects of information security. A number of these are discussed in ISO/IEC 27002, for example the
information security policy is supported by policies concerning access control, clear desk and clear screen, the
use of network services, and the use of cryptographic controls. It is possible that additional layers of policies
may be added in some cases. This arrangement is shown in figure D1.

High Level General Policies
e.g. security policy, privacy policy,
marketing policy, product development policy

High Level Topic-specific Policies
e.g. information security policy

Detailed Policies
e.g. access control policy,
clear desk and clear screen policy
use of network services policy
use of cryptographic controls policy

Figure D.1 — Policy hierarchy
ISO/IEC 27001 requires organizations to have both an ISMS policy and an information security policy. It does
not, however specify any particular relationship between these policies. Requirements for the ISMS policy are
given in clauses 4.2.1 of ISO/IEC 27001. Guidelines for information security policies are given in clause 5.1.1
of ISO/IEC 27002. These policies may be developed as peer policies, the ISMS policy may be subordinate to
the information security policy, or the information security policy may be subordinate to the ISMS policy.

The content of policies is based on context in which an organization operates. Specifically the following should
be considered when developing any policy within the policy framework.
1)

The aims and objectives of the organization

2)

Strategies adopted to achieve its objectives

3)

The structure and processes adopted by the organization

4)

Aims and objectives associated with the topic of the policy

5)

The requirements of related higher level policies

This is shown in Figure D.2.

Figure D.2 — Inputs to the development of a policy
Policies can have the following structure:
1.

Policy Summary – A one or two sentence overview. (This may sometimes be merged with the
introduction.)

2.

Introduction – a brief explanation of the topic of the policy.

3.

Scope – describes those parts or activities of an organization that are affected by the policy. If
relevant, the scope clause lists other policies that are supported by the policy.

4.

Objectives – describes the intent of the policy.

5.

Principles – describes the rules concerning actions and decisions for achieving the objectives. In
some cases it can be useful to identify the key processes associated with the topic of the policy and
then the rules for operating the processes.

6.

Responsibilities – describes who is responsible for actions to meet the requirements of the policy. In
some cases this may include a description of organizational arrangements as well as the
responsibilities of people with designated roles.

7.

Key Outcomes – describes the business outcomes if the objectives are met.

8.

Related policies – describes other policies relevant to the achievement the objectives, usually by
providing additional detail concerning specific topics.

NOTE
Policy content can be organized in a variety of ways. For example, organizations that place emphasis on roles
and responsibilities may simplify the description of objectives, and apply the principles specifically to the description of
responsibilities.

The following is an example of an information security policy, showing its structure and example content.
Information Security Policy (Example)
Policy Summary

Information should always be protected, whatever its form and however it is shared, communicated or stored.
Introduction
Information can exist in many forms. It can be printed or written on paper, stored electronically, transmitted by
post or by using electronic means, shown on films, or spoken in conversation.
Information security is the protection of information from a wide range of threats in order to ensure business
continuity, minimize business risk, and maximize return on investments and business opportunities.
Scope
This policy supports the organization’s general security policy.
This policy applies to all of the organization.
Information Security Objectives
1)

Strategic and operational information security risks are understood and treated to be acceptable to
the organization.

2)

The confidentiality of customer information, product development and marketing plans is protected.

3)

The integrity of accounting records is preserved.

4)

Public web services and internal networks meet specified availability standards.

Information Security Principles
1)

This organization encourages risk-taking and tolerates risks that might not be tolerated in
conservatively managed organizations provided that information risks are understood, monitored and
treated when necessary. Details of the approach taken to risk assessment and treatment are found
in the ISMS policy.

2)

All staff will be made aware and accountable for information security as relevant to their job-role.

3)

Provision will be made for funding information security controls in operational and project
management processes.

4)

Possibilities for fraud associated with abuse of information systems will be taken into account in the
overall management of information systems.

5)

Annex E
(informative)
Monitoring and measuring

This annex provides additional guidance to support the planning and designing monitoring and measuring.
Information on Setting Up Monitoring and Measuring
The design of the ISMS specific requirements includes security monitoring and measurement program for the
ISMS that supports management review
Designing Monitoring

Figure E.1 — The Monitoring Process flow
Preparation and coordination: Identification of relevant assets for monitoring
It should be noted that monitoring is a continuous process and, as such, the design should take into
consideration the set-up of the monitoring process as well as designing the actual monitoring needs and
activities. These activities need to be coordinated, which is part of the design.
Based on previous information set by the scope and the assets defined, in combination with the results from
the risk analysis and the selection of controls, the objectives of monitoring can be defined. These objectives
should include:
•

What to Detect

•

When

•

Against what,

In practical terms, the previously set organizational activities/processes and linked assets are the basic scope
for monitoring (bullet “Against what” above). To design the monitoring, a selection may be needed to cover the
important assets from an information security point of view. Consideration should also be made for the risk
treatment and the selection of controls in order to find what should be monitored on the assets and linked
organization activities/processes. (This will set both what to Detect and When.)

ISO/IEC 27003:2010(E)

As monitoring may have legal aspects, it is essential that the design of the monitoring is checked so that it will
not have any legal ramifications.
To ensure that the monitoring is truly effective, it is important to coordinate and make the final design of all
activities for monitoring.
Monitoring activities
In order to maintain the level of information security, the information security controls identified as appropriate
should be correctly applied; security incidents should be detected and responded to in a timely manner, and
the performance of the information security management system should be monitored regularly. Regular
checks should be performed to see whether all controls are being applied and implemented as planned in the
information security concept. This should involve checking that the technical controls (e.g. as regards the
configuration) and the organizational controls (e.g. processes, procedures and operations) are complied with.
Checks should be primarily geared towards remedying defects. If checks are to be accepted, it is important
that this motivation is recognised by all those involved as being the objective of the checks. It is important to
discuss possible solutions to problems with participants during a check and to pre-prepare appropriate
remedies.
Checks should be carefully prepared so to ensure that they can achieve their goals as efficiently as possible
while at the same time causing as little disruption as possible to the work routine. The general implementation
of checks should be coordinated in advance with management. The design activities may be concluded in
three different basic forms:
•

Incident reports

•

Verification or non-conformity of control functionality

•

Other Regular Checks

Further, the results from the activities should be designed in terms of how records are made and information
given to management. Formal documentation should be made to describe the design and covering principle
activities and their purpose, as well as different responsibilities.
Requirements for monitoring outcome
The results are:
a.

Records of the monitoring activities on required level of detail
As a result of the monitoring activities, a management report should be provided. All the information
that management requires in order to fulfil its management and supervisory duties should be
recorded therein with the required level of detail.

b.

Information to management for decision making when required for prompt actions
Management reports should always end with a list of recommended actions, clearly prioritized,
together with a realistic assessment of the expected cost of implementation of each of these actions.
This ensures that the needed decisions can be obtained from management without undue delay.

Setting up the information security measurement program
Overview for designing an information security measurement program
The measurement process should be seamlessly integrated into the ISMS cycle of the project or organization,
and used to effect the continual improvement of security-related processes and outcomes within that project
or organization. This is referred to as an information security measurement program (ISO/IEC 27004:2009).
The design of the program needs to be viewed in the perspective of the ISMS cycle. The following figure
depicts how the measurement process fits within the ISMS cycle.

The following functions are required of the management systems to ensure the satisfaction of required things
and expectations, such as structuring the necessary PDCA; measuring the validation of outputs and its
effectiveness; and providing feedback of the results of measurement to the manager of the processes.
In order to have the right measurements in place, previously generated information is essential, especially:
a)

The ISMS policy, including scope and boundaries

b)

The result from the risk assessment

c)

The Selection of controls

d)

The Control objectives

e)

The specific information security objectives

f)

Specified Processes and resources and their classification

Management should establish and sustain a commitment to the overall measurement process. In
implementing a measurement process, management should:
a)

Accept the requirements for measurement; see ISO/IEC 27004:2009 for further details

b)

Pay attention to the information needs, see ISO/IEC 27004:2009 for further details

c)

Obtain staff commitment by the following:
•

The organization should demonstrate its commitment through, for example, a
measurement policy for the organization, allocation of responsibility and duties, training,
and the allocation of budget and other resources.

•

A person or organizational unit responsible for the measurement program should be
assigned.

•

The person or organizational unit is responsible for communicating the ISMS
measurement importance and results throughout the organization to ensure its
acceptance and use, and should have the management’s support.

•

Ensure that ISMS measures data is collected, analyzed, and reported to the CIO and
other stakeholders.

•

Educate program line managers about using results of ISMS measurement for policy,
resource allocation, and budget decisions.

The information security measurement program and the design should involve the following roles:
a)

Senior Management

b)

The users of the security products

c)

The persons in charge of information systems

d)

The persons in charge of information security

An Information Security Measurement Program is established in order to get indicators of the effectiveness of
the ISMS, control objectives and controls. The program is described in ISO/IEC 27004:2009.
The result of the Plan Phase suitable measurements should be conducted to fulfil these objectives.

A suitable Information Security Measurement Programme could be different depending on the organization’s
structure:
•

Size

•

Complexity

•

Overall risk profile/need of information security

Generally, the larger and more complex an organization, the more extensive the measurement program
needed. But the level of overall risk affects the extent of the measurement program as well. If the impact of
poor information security is severe, a comparatively smaller organization may need a more comprehensive
measurement program in order to cover the risk than a larger organization that does not face the same impact.
The extent of the measuring program can be evaluated based on the selection of controls that need to be
covered and the results from the risk analysis.
Designing the information security measurement program
The person responsible for the information security measurement program should consider the following:
•

Scope

•

Measurements

•

Carry out the measurements

•

Periods of measurements

•

Reporting

The scope of the measuring program should cover the scope, control objectives and controls of the ISMS. In
particular, the objectives and boundaries of the ISMS Measurement should be set in terms of the
characteristics of the organization, the organization, its location, assets and technology, and include details of
and justification for any exclusion from the ISMS scope. This may be a single security control, a process, a
system, a functional area, the whole enterprise, a single site, or a multi-site organization.
When selecting single measurements, ISO/IEC 27004:2009 Information Security Measurement Process
stipulates that the starting point is the object of measure. In order to establish a measurement program these
objects should be identified. These objects could be a process or a resource. (See ISO/IEC 27004:2009 for
further details). When defining the program the objects defined by ISMS scope is often broken down to find
the actual objects that should be measured. This defining process could be exemplified by the following
example: The Organization is the overall object – Organization Process A/or IT system X is a part of that
object and constitutes an object in itself– Objects within that process that affect information security (People,
Rules, Network, Applications, Facilities etc.) are generally the objects of measure in order to see the
effectiveness of protecting information.
When implementing an Information Security Measurement Program, care should be taken to consider that the
objects of measure may serve many organization processes within the ISMS scope, and may therefore have a
larger impact on the effectiveness of the ISMS and Control objectives. Such Objects should generally be
prioritized with the scope of the program, such as the Security Organization and linked process, Computer
Hall, co-workers regarding information security, etc.
The measurement interval may vary, but is preferable that the measurement is done or summarized at certain
intervals in order to fit into the management review and the continual improvement process and ambitions of
the ISMS. The design of the program should state this.
The reporting of the results should be designed so that communication is assured according to
ISO/IEC 27004:2009.

65

ISO/IEC 27003:2010(E)

The design of the Information Security Measurement program should be concluded in a document stipulating
the procedure, which should be approved by management. This document should cover the following:
a)

Responsibilities for the Information Security Measurement Program

b)

Responsibilities for communication

c)

The scope of measurements

d)

How it is going to be performed (basic method used, external, internal execution, etc.)

e)

When it should be performed

f)

How it is reported

If the organization develops its own measuring points, these have to be documented as part of the design
phase; for further reference see ISO/IEC 27004:2009. This document may be quite comprehensive and does
not necessarily need to be signed by management, as the details may change when implemented.
Measuring the effectiveness of the ISMS
When setting the scope for the Information Security Measurement Program that should be implemented, care
should be taken so that the objects are not too numerous. If they are, it may be wise to divide the program into
different parts. The scope of these parts may be seen as separate measurements for comparison, but their
main purpose prevails: that a combination of the measurements provides an indication to evaluate ISMS
effectiveness. These sub-scopes are normally an organizational unit that could be defined with clear
boundaries. A combination of objects that serves many organization processes and the measurements of
objects within the sub-scopes may together form a proper scope for the Information Security Measurement
Program. This could also be seen as a series of ISMS activities that can be regarded as constructed with two
or more processes/objects. Therefore, the effectiveness of the entire ISMS can be measured based on
measuring the results of these two or more processes/objects.
As the objectives are to measure the effectiveness of the ISMS, it is important to measure the control
objectives and controls. A sufficient number of controls is one aspect, and that these controls are sufficient for
evaluating the effectiveness of the ISMS is the other aspect. (There may be other reasons for limiting the
scope of the Information Security Measurement Program, which is mentioned in ISO/IEC 27004:2009.)

Figure E.2 — Two aspects of measurement effectiveness with the PDCA process of ISMS and the
examples of process within the organization

When using measurement results for evaluating the effectiveness of ISMS, Control objectives and controls it
is essential that the management is aware of the scope of the Information Security Measurement Program.
The person responsible for the measuring program should have management approval for the scope of the
information Security Measurement Program prior to launch.
NOTE 1
The requirement related to the measurement of effectiveness in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 is “the measurement of
controls or series of controls.” (see 4.2.2 d) in ISO/IEC 27001:2005)
NOTE 2
The requirement related to the effectiveness of the entire ISMS in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 is only a “review of the
effectiveness of the entire ISMS”, and “the measurement of the entire ISMS” is not required. (See 0.2.2 in ISO/IEC
27001:2005).

The actual carrying out of measurements could be done using internal personnel, external, or a combination.
The size, structure and culture of the organization are factors to consider when evaluating internal or external
resources. Small and medium size companies have more to benefit from using external support than larger
organizations. The result from using external resources could also provide a more valid result, depending on
the culture. If the organization is accustomed to internal audits, internal resources may be just as valid.

Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27004 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.

Introduction

0.1 General
This International Standard provides guidance on the development and use of measures and measurement in
order to assess the effectiveness of an implemented information security management system (ISMS) and
controls or groups of controls, as specified in ISO/IEC 27001.
This would include policy, information security risk management, control objectives, controls, processes and
procedures, and support the process of its revision, helping to determine whether any of the ISMS processes
or controls need to be changed or improved. It needs to be kept in mind that no measurement of controls can
guarantee complete security.
The implementation of this approach constitutes an Information Security Measurement Programme. The
Information Security Measurement Programme will assist management in identifying and evaluating noncompliant and ineffective ISMS processes and controls and prioritizing actions associated with improvement
or changing these processes and/or controls. It may also assist the organization in demonstrating
ISO/IEC 27001 compliance and provide additional evidence for management review and information security
risk management processes.
This International Standard assumes that the starting point for the development of measures and
measurement is a sound understanding of the information security risks that an organization faces, and that
an organization’s risk assessment activities have been performed correctly (i.e. based on ISO/IEC 27005), as
required by ISO/IEC 27001. The Information Security Measurement Programme will encourage an
organization to provide reliable information to relevant stakeholders concerning its information security risks
and the status of the implemented ISMS to manage these risks.
Effectively implemented, the Information Security Measurement Programme would improve stakeholder
confidence in measurement results, and enable the stakeholders to use these measures to effect continual
improvement of information security and the ISMS.
The accumulated measurement results will allow comparison of progress in achieving information security
objectives over a period of time as part of an organization’s ISMS continual improvement process.
0.2 Management overview
ISO/IEC 27001 requires the organization to “undertake regular reviews of the effectiveness of the ISMS taking
into account results from effectiveness measurement” and to “measure the effectiveness of controls to verify
that security requirements have been met”. ISO/IEC 27001 also requires the organization to “define how to
measure the effectiveness of the selected controls or groups of controls and specify how these measures are
to be used to assess control effectiveness to produce comparable and reproducible results”.
The approach adopted by an organization to fulfil the measurement requirements specified in ISO/IEC 27001
will vary based on a number of significant factors, including the information security risks that the organization
faces, its organizational size, resources available, and applicable legal, regulatory and contractual
requirements. Careful selection and justification of the method used to fulfil the measurement requirements
are important to ensure that excessive resources are not devoted to these activities of the ISMS to the
detriment of others. Ideally, ongoing measurement activities are to be integrated into the regular operations of
the organization with minimal additional resource requirements.
This International Standard gives recommendations concerning the following activities as a basis for an
organization to fulfil measurement requirements specified in ISO/IEC 27001:
a) developing measures (i.e. base measures, derived measures and indicators);

implementing and operating an Information Security Measurement Programme;
collecting and analysing data;
developing measurement results;
communicating developed measurement results to the relevant stakeholders;
using measurement results as contributing factors to ISMS-related decisions;
using measurement results to identify needs for improving the implemented ISMS, including its scope,
policies, objectives, controls, processes and procedures; and
h) facilitating continual improvement of the Information Security Measurement Programme.
One of the factors that will impact the organization’s ability to achieve measurement is its size. Generally the
size and complexity of the business in combination with the importance of information security affect the
extent of measurement needed, both in terms of the numbers of measures to be selected and the frequency
of collecting and analysing data. For SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) a less comprehensive information
security measurement program will be sufficient, whereas large enterprises will implement and operate
multiple Information Security Measurement Programmes.
A single Information Security Measurement Programme may be sufficient for small organizations, whereas for
large enterprises the need may exist for multiple Information Security Measurement Programmes.
The guidance provided by this International Standard will result in the production of documentation that will
contribute to demonstrating that control effectiveness is being measured and assessed.

Information security measurement overview

5.1 Objectives of information security measurement
The objectives of information security measurement in the context of an ISMS includes:
a) evaluating the effectiveness of the implemented controls or groups of controls (See “4.2.2 d)” in Figure 1);
b) evaluating the effectiveness of the implemented ISMS (See “4.2.3 b)” in Figure 1);
c) verifying the extent to which identified security requirements have been met (See “4.2.3 c)” in Figure 1);
d) facilitating performance improvement of information security in terms of the organization’s overall
business risks;
e) providing input for management review to facilitate ISMS-related decision making and justify needed
improvements of the implemented ISMS.
Figure 1 illustrates the cyclical input–output relationship of the measurement activities in relation to the PlanDo-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, specified in ISO/IEC 27001. Numbers in each figure represent relevant subclauses of ISO/IEC 27001:2005.

Figure 1 — Measurement inputs and outputs in ISMS PDCA cycle of information security management
The organization should establish measurement objectives based on a number of considerations, including:
a) The role of information security in support of the organization’s overall business activities and the risks
it faces;
b) Applicable legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements;
c) Organizational structure;
d) Costs and benefits of implementing information security measures;
e) Risk acceptance criteria for the organization; and
f) A need to compare several ISMSs within the same organization.
5.2 Information Security Measurement Programme
An organization should establish and manage an Information Security Measurement Programme in order to
achieve the established measurement objectives and adopt the PDCA model within the organization’s overall
measurement activities. An organization should also develop and implement measurement constructs in order
to obtain repeatable, objective and useful results of measurement based on the Information Security
Measurement Model (see 5.4).
The Information Security Measurement Programme and the developed measurement construct should ensure
that an organization effectively achieves objective and repeatable measurement and provides measurement
results for relevant stakeholders to identify needs for improving the implemented ISMS, including its scope,
policies, objectives, controls, processes and procedures.

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

An Information Security Measurement Programme should include the following processes:
a) Measures and measurement development (see Clause 7) ;
b) Measurement operation (see Clause 8);
c) Data analysis and measurement results reporting (see Clause 9); and
d) Information Security Measurement Programme evaluation and improvement (see Clause 10).
The organisational and operational structure of an Information Security Measurement Programme should be
determined by taking into account the scale and complexity of the ISMS of which it is a part. In all cases, roles
and responsibilities for the Information Security Measurement Programme should be explicitly assigned to
competent personnel (see 7.5.8).
The measures selected and implemented by the Information Security Measurement Programme should be
directly related to the operation of an ISMS, other measures, as well as organization’s business processes.
Measurement can be integrated into regular operational activities or performed at regular intervals determined
by ISMS management.
5.3 Success factors
The following are some contributing factors to the success of Information Security Measurement Programme
in facilitating continual ISMS improvement:
a) Management commitment supported by appropriate resources;
b) Existence of ISMS processes and procedures;
c) A repeatable process capable of capturing and reporting meaningful data to provide relevant trends over
a period of time;
d) Quantifiable measures based on ISMS objectives;
e) Easily obtainable data that can be used for measurement;
f) Evaluation of effectiveness of Information Security Measurement Programme and implementation of
identified improvements;
g) Consistent periodic collection, analysis, and reporting of measurement data in a manner that is
meaningful;
h) Use of the measurement results by relevant stakeholders to identify needs for improving the implemented
ISMS, including its scope, policies, objectives, controls, processes and procedures;
i) Acceptance of feedback on measurement results from relevant stakeholders; and
j) Evaluations of the usefulness of measurement results and implementation of identified improvements.
Once successfully implemented, an Information Security Measurement Programme can:
1) Demonstrate an organization’s compliance with applicable legal or regulatory requirements and
contractual obligations;
2) Support identification of previously undetected or unknown information security issues;
3) Assist in satisfying management reporting needs when stating measures for historical and current
activities; and
4) Be used as input into information security risk management process, internal ISMS audits and
management reviews.
5.4 Information security measurement model
NOTE. The concepts of the information security measurement model and measurement constructs adopted in this
International Standard are based on those in ISO/IEC 15939. The term “information product” used in ISO/IEC 15939 is a
synonym with “measurement results” in this International Standard and “measurement process” used in ISO/IEC 15939 is
a synonym with “Measurement Programme” in this International Standard.

5.4.1

Overview

The information security measurement model is a structure linking an information need to the relevant objects
of measurement and their attributes. Objects of measurement may include planned or implemented
processes, procedures, projects and resources.

The information security measurement model describes how the relevant attributes are quantified and
converted to indicators that provide a basis for decision making. Figure 2 depicts the information security
measurement model.

model.

Clause 7 provides detailed information about the individual elements of information security measurement

Subsequent sub-clauses introduce individual elements of the model. They also provide examples of how
these individual elements are used.
The information needs or purpose of measurement used in examples contain in Tables 1 to 4 of the following
sub-clauses is to assess the awareness status of compliance with organization security policy among relevant
personnel (Control objective.A.8.2, and Controls A.8.2.1 and A.8.2.2. of ISO/IEC 27001:2005).
5.4.2

Base measure and measurement method

A base measure is the simplest measure that can be obtained. A base measure results from applying a
measurement method to the attributes selected of an object of measurement. An object of measurement may
have many attributes, only some of which may provide useful values to be assigned to a base measure. A
given attribute may be used for several different base measures.

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

A measurement method is a logical sequence of operations used in quantifying an attribute with respect to a
specified scale. The operation may involve activities such as counting occurrences or observing the passage
of time.
A measurement method can apply attributes to an object of measurement. Examples of an object of
measurement include but are not limited to:
- Performance of controls implemented in the ISMS;
- Status of information assets protected by the controls;
- Performance of processes implemented in the ISMS;
- Behaviour of personnel who are responsible to the implemented ISMS;
- Activities of organizational units responsible for information security; and
- Extent of satisfaction of interested parties.
A measurement method may use measurement objects of measurement and attributes from a variety of
sources, such as:
- Risk analysis and risk assessment results;
- Questionnaires and personal interviews;
- Internal and/or external audits reports;
- Records of events, such as logs, report statistics, and audit trails;
- Incident reports, particularly those that result in the occurrence of an impact;
- Test results, e.g. from penetration testing, social engineering, compliance tools, and security audit tools;
or
- Records from the organization’s information security related procedures and programmes, eg. information
security awareness training results.
Tables 1-4 below present the application of the information security model for the following controls:
“Control 2” refers to control A.8.2.1 Management responsibility of ISO/IEC 27001:2005 (“Management
shall require employees, contractors and third party users to apply security in accordance with
established policies and procedures of the organization”); being implemented as follows: “All
personnel relevant to the ISMS must sign user agreements before being granted access to an
information system”;
“Control 1” refers to control A.8.2.2 “Information security awareness, education and training” of
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 (“All employees of the organization and, where relevant, contractors and third
party users shall receive appropriate awareness training and regular updates in organizational policies
and procedures, as relevant for their job function”); being implemented as follows: “All personnel
relevant to the ISMS must receive information security awareness training before being granted
access to an information system”.
The corresponding measurement constructs are contained in B.1.
NOTE Table 1-4 consists of various columns (Table 1, four columns; Table 2-4, three columns) of which are assigned a
letter designator. Each box within individual columns is assigned a number designator. The combinations of letter and
number designators are used in subsequent boxes to refer to previous boxes. Arrows designate the data flows between
individual elements of the information security measurement model within the specific example.

Table 1 includes an example of the relationships between object of measurement, attribute, measurement
method and base measure for measuring the objects established for implemented controls described above.

Derived measure and measurement function

A derived measure is an aggregate of two or more base measures. A given base measure may serve as input
for several derived measures.
A measurement function is a calculation used to combine base measures together to create a derived
measure.
The scale and unit of the derived measure depends on the scales and units of the base measures from which
it is composed as well as how they are combined by the measurement function.
The measurement function may involve a variety of techniques, such as averaging base measures, applying
weights to base measures, or assigning qualitative values to base measures. The measurement function may
combine base measures using different scales, such as percentages and qualitative assessment results.
An example of the relationship of further elements of the information security measurement model application
i.e. base measure, measurement function and derived measure is presented in Table 2.

Indicators and analytical model

An indicator is a measure that provides an estimate or evaluation of specified attributes derived from an
analytical model with respect to defined information need. Indicators are obtained by applying an analytical
model to a base and/or a derived measure and combining them with decision criteria. The scale and
measurement method affect the choice of analytical techniques used to produce indicators.
An example of the relationships between derived measures, analytical model and indicators for the
information security measurement model application is presented in Table 3.

other visual methods

5.4.5

Measurement results and decision criteria

Measurement results are developed with interpreting applicable indicators based on defined decision criteria
and should be considered in the context of the overall measurement objectives of assessing the ISMS
effectiveness. Decision criteria is used to determine the need for action or further investigation, as well as to
describe the level of confidence in measurement results. Decision criteria may be applied to a series of
indicators, for example to conduct trend analysis based on indicators received at different point in time.
Targets provide detailed performance specifications, applicable to the organization or parts thereof, derived
from the information security objectives such as the ISMS objectives and control objectives, and that need to
be set and met in order to achieve those objectives.
An example of the relationship of final elements of the information security measurement model application
(i.e. indicator, decision criteria and measurement results) is presented in Table 4.

Management responsibilities

6.1 Overview
Management is responsible for establishing the Information Security Measurement Programme, involving
relevant stakeholders (see 7.5.8) in the measurement activities, accepting measurement results as an input
into management review and using measurement result in improvement activities within the ISMS.
To achieve this, management should:
a)
Establish objectives for the Information Security Measurement Programme;
b)
Establish a policy for the Information Security Measurement Programme;
c)
Establish roles and responsibilities for the Information Security Measurement Programme;
d)
Provide adequate resources to perform measurement including personnel, funding, tools and
infrastructure;
e)
Ensure that the objectives of the Information Security Measurement Programme are achieved;
f)
Ensure that tools and equipment used to collect data are maintained properly;
g)
Establish the purpose of measurement for each measurement construct;
h)
Ensure that measurement provides sufficient information to relevant stakeholders with regard to
effectiveness of the ISMS and needs for improving the implemented ISMS, including its scope,
policies, objectives, controls, processes and procedures; and
i)
Ensure that measurement provides sufficient information to relevant stakeholders with regard to
effectiveness of controls or group of controls and needs for improving the implemented controls.
Through the appropriate assignment of measurement roles and responsibilities, management should ensure
measurement results are not influenced by information owners (see 7.5.8). This may be achieved through
segregation of duties or, if this is not possible, through the use of detailed documentation that allows

independent checks.
6.2 Resource management
Management should assign and provide resources to support essential activities of measurement, such as
data collection, analysis, storage, reporting, and distribution. Resource allocations should include the
assignment of:
a) Individuals with responsibility for all aspects of Information Security Measurement Programme;
b) Appropriate financial support; and
c) Appropriate infrastructure support, such as physical infrastructure and tools used to perform the
measurement process.
NOTE
Clause 5.2.1 of ISO/IEC 27001:2005 specifies requirement on the provision of resources for implementation
and operation of an ISMS.

6.3 Measurement training, awareness, and competence
Management should ensure that:
a) The stakeholders (see 7.5.8) are trained adequately for achieving their roles and responsibilities in the
implemented Information Security Measurement Programme, and appropriately qualified to perform their
roles and responsibilities; and
b) The stakeholders understand that their duties include making suggestions for improvements in the
implemented Information Security Measurement Programme.

Measures and measurement development

7.1 Overview
This clause provides guidance on how to develop measures and measurement for the purpose of assessing
the effectiveness of the implemented ISMS and controls or group of controls, and identifying organisationspecific sets of measurement constructs. Activities needed to develop measures and measurement should be
established and documented, including the following:
a) Defining the measurement scope (see 7.2);
b) Identifying an information need (see 7.3);
c) Selecting the object of measurement and its attributes (see 7.4) ;
d) Developing measurement constructs (see 7.5);
e) Applying measurement constructs (see 7.6);
f) Establishing data collection and analysis processes and tools (see 7.7), and
g) Establishing measurement implementation approach and documentation (see 7.8).
When establishing these activities, the organization should take into account financial, human, and
infrastructure (physical and tools) resources.
7.2 Definition of measurement scope
Depending on an organization’s capabilities and resources, the initial scope of an organization’s measurement
activities will be limited to such elements as specific controls, information assets protected by specific controls,
specific activities for information security that are given highest priority by management. Over time, the scope
of measurement activities will be widened to address further elements of the implemented ISMS and controls
or group of controls, taking into account stakeholders’ priorities.
Relevant stakeholders should be identified and should participate in defining the measurement scope. The
relevant stakeholders may be internal or external to the organizational units, such as project managers,
information system managers, or information security decision makers. Specific measurement results
addressing the effectiveness of individual controls or group of controls should be defined and communicated
to relevant stakeholders.

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

The organization may consider limiting the number of measurement results to be reported to decision-makers
within a given time period to ensure their ability to effect improvement of the ISMS based on the reported
measurement results. An excessive number of reported measurement results will impact the ability of the
decision-maker to focus efforts and prioritize future improvement activities. Measurement results should be
prioritized based on the importance of corresponding information needs and associated ISMS objectives.
NOTE
The measurement scope is related to the scope of the ISMS established in accordance with 4.2.1 a) of
ISO/IEC 27001:2005.

7.3 Identification of information need
Each measurement construct should correspond to, at least, one information need. An example of the
information need, describing in starting point as the purpose of measurement and ending with relevant
decision criteria is presented in Annex A.
The following activities should be performed to identify relevant information needs:
a) Examine the ISMS and its processes, such as:
1) ISMS policy and objectives, control objectives and controls;
2) Legal, regulatory, contractual and organizational requirements for information security;
3) The information security risk management process outcomes, as described in ISO/IEC
27001.
b) Prioritize the identified information needs based on criteria, such as:
1) Risk treatment priorities;
2) An organization’s capabilities and resources;
3) Stakeholders’ interests;
4) The information security policy;
5) Information required to meet legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements;
6) The value of the information in relation to the cost of measurement;
c) Select a subset of information required to be addressed in measurement activities from the prioritized
list; and
d) Document and communicate the selected information needs to all relevant stakeholders.
All relevant measures applied to an implemented ISMS, controls or groups of controls should be implemented
based on the selected information needs.
7.4 Object and attribute selection
An object of measurement and its attributes should be identified in the overall context and scope of an ISMS.
It should be noted that an object of measurement can have several applicable attributes.
The object and its attributes to be used by measurement should be selected based on the priority of a
corresponding information needs.
The values to be assigned to a relevant base measure are obtained by applying an appropriate measurement
method to the selected attributes. This selection should also ensure that:
- Relevant base measure and an appropriate measurement method can be identified; and
- Meaningful measurement results can be developed based on the obtained values and developed
measures.
Characteristics of selected attributes determine which type of a measurement method needs to be used to
obtain values to be assigned to base measures (e.g. qualitative or quantitative).
The selected object and attributes should be documented, along with the rationale for the selection.
Data describing the object of measurement and corresponding attributes should be used as the values to be
assigned to base measures. Examples of objects of measurement include but are not limited to:
- Products and services;
- Processes;

-

Applicable assets such as facilities, applications, and information systems as identified in ISO/IEC
27001:2005 (Inventory of assets, A.7.1.1);
Business units;
Geographic locations; and
Third party services.

Attributes should be reviewed to ensure that:
a) Appropriate attributes have been selected for measurement; and
b) Data collection has been defined to ensure a sufficient number of attributes is present to allow for effective
measurement.
Only attributes that are relevant to the corresponding base measure should be selected. Although the
selection of attributes should take into consideration the degree of difficulty in obtaining the attributes to
measure, it should not be made solely upon data being easily obtainable or the attribute being easy to
measure.
7.5 Measurement construct development
7.5.1

Overview

This sub-clause (7.5) addresses measurement construct development from 7.5.2 (measure selection) to 7.5.8
(stakeholders).
7.5.2

Measure selection

Measures that could potentially satisfy the selected information need should be identified. The identified
measures should be defined in sufficient detail to allow for selection of measures to be implemented. Newly
identified measures may involve an adaptation of an existing measure.
NOTE
Identification of base measures is closely related with identification of objects of measurement and their
attributes.

The identified measures that could potentially satisfy the selected information need should be selected.
Context information necessary to interpret or normalize measures also should be considered.
NOTE
Many different combinations of measures (i.e. base measures, derived measures, and indicators) may be
selected to address a specific information need.

The selected measures should reflect the priority of the information needs. Further example criteria that may
be used for the selection of measures include:
- Ease of data collection;
- Availability of human resources to collect and manage data;
- Availability of appropriate tools;
- Number of potentially relevant indicators supported by the base measure;
- Ease of interpretation;
- Number of users of developed measurement results;
- Evidence as to the measure’s fitness for purpose or information need; and
- Costs of collecting, managing, and analysing the data.
7.5.3

Measurement method

For each individual base measure a measurement method should be defined. This measurement method is
used to quantify an object of measurement through transforming the attributes into the value to be assigned to
the base measure.
A measurement method may be subjective or objective. Subjective methods rely on quantification involving
human judgment, while objective methods use quantification based on numerical rules such as counting which
may be implemented via human or automated means.

15

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

The measurement method quantifies the attributes as values by applying an appropriate scale. Each scale
uses units of measurement. Only quantities expressed in the same unit of measurement are directly
comparable.
For each measurement method, verification process should be established and documented. This verification
should ensure a level of confidence in the value that is to be obtained by applying a measurement method to
an attribute of object of measurement and assigned to a base measure. Where necessary to ascertain valid
value, tools used to obtain attributes should be standardized and verified at specified intervals.
The precision of the measurement method should be taken into account and the associated deviation or
variance should be recorded.
A measurement method should be consistent over time so that the values assigned to a base measure taken
at different times are comparable and that the values assigned to a derived measure and an indicator are also
comparable.
7.5.4

Measurement function

For each individual derived measure a measurement function should be defined which is applied to two or
more values assigned to base measures. This measurement function is used to transform the values assigned
to one or more base measures into the value to be assigned to a derived measure. In some cases, a base
measure may contribute directly to the analytical model in addition to a derived measure.
A measurement function (e.g. a calculation) may involve a variety of techniques, such as averaging all values
assigned to base measures, applying weights to values assigned to base measures, or assigning qualitative
values to values assigned to base measures before aggregating them into the value to be assigned to a
derived measure. The measurement function may combine values assigned to base measures using different
scales, such as percentages and qualitative assessment results.
7.5.5

Analytical model

For each indicator, an analytical model should be defined for the purpose of transforming one or more values
assigned to a base and/or a derived measure into the value to be assigned to the indicator.
The analytical model combines relevant measures in a way that produces an output that is meaningful to
stakeholders.
Decision criteria that are applied to an indicator should also be considered when defining the analytical model.
Sometimes an analytical model may be as simple as transforming a single value assigned to a derived
measure into the value to be assigned to an indicator.
7.5.6

Indicators

The values to be assigned to indicators will be produced by aggregating values assigned to the derived
measure and interpreting these values based on the decision criteria. For each indicator that will be reported
to the client a format for indicator’s presentation as a part of reporting formats (see 7.7) should be defined.
Formats for indicator's presentation will visually depict the measures and provide a verbal explanation of the
indicators. Formats for indicator's presentation should be customized to meet the information need of the
client.
7.5.7

Decision criteria

Decision criteria corresponding to each indicator should be defined and documented based on information
security objectives, to provide actionable guidance for stakeholders. This guidance should address the
expectations for progress and the thresholds for initiating improvement actions based on the indicator.

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

Decision criteria establish a target by which success (see 5.3) is measured and provide guidance on
interpreting the indicator in relation to its proximity to the target.
Targets need to be set for each item regarding performance of ISMS processes and controls, achievement of
objectives, and for effectiveness of the ISMS to be evaluated.
Management may decide not to set targets for indicators until the initial data is collected. Once the corrective
actions based on the initial data are identified, appropriate decision criteria and implementation milestones
can be defined that are realistic for a specific ISMS. If decision criteria cannot be established at that point,
management should evaluate whether the object of measurement and corresponding measures are providing
expected value for the organization.
Establishment of decision criteria can be facilitated if historic data that pertains to developed or selected
measures is available. Trends observed in the past will provide insight into ranges of performance that have
existed previously and guide the creation of realistic decision criteria. Decision criteria may be calculated or
based on a conceptual understanding of expected behaviour. Decision criteria may be derived from historical
data, plans, and heuristics, or computed as statistical control limits or statistical confidence limits.
7.5.8

Stakeholders

For each base and/or derived measure appropriate stakeholders should be identified and documented.
Stakeholders may include the following:
a) Client for measurement: the management or other interested parties requesting or requiring
information about the effectiveness of an ISMS, controls or group of controls;
b) Reviewer for measurement: the person or organizational unit that validates that the developed
measurement constructs are appropriate for assessing the effectiveness of an ISMS, controls or
group of controls;
c) Information owner: the person or organizational unit that owns the information about an object of
measurement and attributes and is responsible for the measurement;
d) Information collector: the person or organizational unit responsible for collecting, recording and storing
the data; and
e) Information communicator: the person or organizational unit responsible for analysing data and
communicating measurement results.
7.6 Measurement construct
As a minimum, the measurement construct specification should include the following information:
a) Purpose of measurement;
b) Control objective to be achieved by controls, and specific controls, group of controls and ISMS process to
be measured;
c) Object of measurement;
d) Data to be collected and used;
e) Processes for data collection and analysis;
f) Process for reporting of measurement results, including reporting formats;
g) Roles and responsibilities of relevant stakeholders; and
h) A cycle for reviewing the measurement to ensure their usefulness in relation to an information need.
Annex A provides a generic measurement construct example that incorporates a) to h). Annex B provides
measurement construct examples applied to measuring ISMS processes and controls.
7.7 Data collection, analysis and reporting
Procedures for data collection and analysis, and processes for reporting of developed measurement results
should be established. Supporting tools, measurement equipment and technologies should also be
established, if required. These procedures, tools, measurement equipment and technologies will address the
following activities:
a) Data collection, including data storage and verification (see 8.3). The procedures should identify how
data are to be collected by using measurement method, measurement function and analytical model,
Licensed to Mr. PEDDINTI

17

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

as well as how and where they will be stored together with any context information necessary to
understand and verify the data. Data verification can be performed by inspecting the data against a
checklist which is constructed to verify that missing data are minimal, and that the value to be
assigned to each measure is valid.
NOTE: Verification of values to be assigned to base measures is closely related with verification of measurement
method (see 7.5.3).

b) Data analysis and reporting of developed measurement results. The procedures should specify the
data analysis techniques (see 9.2), and the frequency, format and methods for reporting the
measurement results. The range of tools that may be needed to perform the data analysis should be
identified.
Examples of reporting formats include:
-

Scorecards to provide strategic information by integrating high level indicators;
Executive and operational dashboards less focused on strategic objectives and more tied to the
effectiveness of specific controls and processes;
Reports, from simple and static in nature, such as a list of measures for a given time period, to more
sophisticated cross-tab reports with nested grouping, rolling summaries, and dynamic drill-through or
linking. Reports are best used when the user needs to look at raw data in an easy-to-read format; and
Gauges to represent a dynamic values including alerts, additional graphical elements and labelling of
endpoints.

7.8 Measurement implementation and documentation
The overall approach to measurement should be documented in an implementation plan. The implementation
plan should include the following information as a minimum:
a) Information Security Measurement Programme implementation for the organization;
b) Measurement specification as follows:
1) Organization’s generic measurement construct;
2) Organization’s individual measurement constructs; and
3) Definition of the range and procedures for data collection and data analysis;
c) Calendar plan to perform measurement activities;
d) Records created through performing measurement activities, including collected data and analysis records;
and
e) Reporting formats for measurement results to be reported to management/stakeholders (see ISO/IEC
27001:2005 Clause 7 “Management review”).

Measurement operation

8.1 Overview
Operation of information security measurement involves activities that are essential for ensuring that the
developed measurement results provide accurate information with regard to effectiveness of an implemented
ISMS, controls or group of controls and needs for appropriate improvement actions.
This activity includes the following:
a) Integrating measurement procedures into the overall operation of the ISMS.
b) Collecting, storing and verifying data.
8.2 Procedure integration
The Information Security Measurement Programme should be fully integrated into and used by the ISMS. The
measurement procedures should be coordinated with the operation of the ISMS including:
a) Definition and documentation of roles, authority and responsibility, regarding development,
implementation, and maintenance of information security measurement;

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

b) Collection of data, and, where needed, modifying current operation of the ISMS to accommodate data
generation and collection activities;
c) Communication of the changes in data collection activities to relevant stakeholders;
d) Maintenance of information collectors’ competency and understanding of the required types of data, data
collection tools, and data collection procedures;
e) Development of policies and procedures defining the use of measurement within the organization,
dissemination of the measurement information, auditing and review of the Information Security
Measurement Programme;
f) Integration of data analysis and reporting into the relevant processes to ensure their regular performance;
g) Monitoring, reviewing and evaluating measurement results;
h) Establishment of a process for phasing measures out and adding new measures to ensure that they
evolve with the organization; and
i)
Establishment of a process for determining the useful life of historical data for trend analysis.
8.3 Data collection, storage and verification
Data collection, storage and verification activities include the following:
a) Collecting required data within regular intervals using a designated measurement method;
b) Documenting the data collection, including:
1) date, time, and location of data collection;
2) information collector;
3) information owner;
4) any issues that occurred during data collection that may be useful;
5) information for data verification and measurement validation; and
c) Verifying collected data against measures selection criteria and measurement constructs validation
criteria.
The collected data and any necessary context information should be consolidated and stored in a recording
format conducive to data analysis.

9

Data analysis and measurement results reporting

9.1 Overview
Collected data should be analysed to develop measurement results and developed measurement results
should be communicated.
This activity includes the following:
a) Analysing data and developing measurement results; and
b) Communicating measurement results to relevant stakeholders.
9.2 Analyse data and develop measurement results
Collected data should be analysed and interpreted in terms of the decision criteria. The data may be
aggregated, transformed, or re-coded prior to analysis. During this task, data should be processed to produce
the indicators. A number of analysis techniques can be applied. The depth of the analysis should be
determined by the nature of the data and the information need.
NOTE
Guidance for performing statistical analysis may be found ISO/TR 10017 (Guidance on statistical techniques
for ISO 9001).

The data analysis results should be interpreted. The person analysing the results (communicator) should be
able to draw some initial conclusions based on the results. However, since the communicator(s) might not be
directly involved in the technical and management processes, such conclusions need to be reviewed by other
stakeholders. All interpretations should take into account the context of the measures.
Data analysis should identify gaps between the expected and actual measurement results of an implemented
ISMS, controls or groups of controls. Identified gaps will point to needs for improving the implemented ISMS,
including its scope, policies, objectives, controls, processes and procedures.

ISO/IEC 27004:2009(E)

Those indicators that demonstrate non-compliance or poor performance should be identified and may be
classified as follows:
a) Risk treatment plan failure to implement or sufficiently implement, operate, and manage controls or ISMS
processes (e.g., controls and ISMS processes can be bypassed by threats);
b) Risk assessment failure:
1) Controls or ISMS processes are ineffective because they are insufficient to either counter
estimated threats (e.g. because likelihood of threats was underestimated); or counter new threats;
2) Controls or ISMS processes are not implemented, because of overlooked threats.
Reports that are used to communicate measurement results to relevant stakeholders should be prepared
using appropriate reporting formats (see 7.7) in accordance with the Information Security Measurement
Programme implementation plan.
The conclusions of the analysis should be reviewed by relevant stakeholders to ensure proper interpretation of
the data. The results of data analysis should be documented for communication to stakeholders.
9.3 Communicate measurement results
Information communicator should determine how to communicate the information security measurement
results, such as:
- Which measurement results are to be reported internally and externally;
- Listings of measures corresponding to individual stakeholders, and interested parties;
- Specific measurement results to be provided, and the type of presentation, tailored to the needs of
each group; and
- Means for obtaining feedback from the stakeholders to be used for evaluating the usefulness of
measurement results and the effectiveness of Information Security Measurement Programme.
Measurement results should be communicated to a variety of internal stakeholders including but not limited to:
- Clients for measurement (see 7.5.8);
- Information owners (see 7.5.8);
- Personnel in charge of the information security risk management, especially where failures of risk
assessment are identified; and
- Personnel who are responsible to the identified areas in need of improvement.
The organization may be requested in some cases to distribute reports of measurement results to external
parties, including regulatory authorities, shareholders, customers, and suppliers. It is recommended that
reports on measurement results to be distributed externally only contain data appropriate for external release
and are approved by management and relevant stakeholders before being released.

10 Information Security Measurement Programme Evaluation and Improvement
10.1 Overview
The organization should evaluate at planned intervals the following:
a) Effectiveness of the implemented Information Security Measurement Programme to ensure that it:
1) Produces measurement results in an effective manner;
2) Is executed as planned;
3) Addresses changes in the implemented ISMS and/or controls;
4) Addresses changes in the environment (e.g., requirements, legislation, or technology); and
b) Usefulness of developed measurement results to ensure that they satisfy relevant information needs.
Management should specify the frequency of such evaluation, plan periodic revisions and establish the
mechanisms for making such revisions possible (see clause 7.2 of ISO/IEC 27001:2005).
The relevant activities should be as follows:
1) To identify evaluation criteria for the Information Security Measurement Programme (see 10.2);
2) To monitor, review, and evaluate measurement (see 10.3); and
3) To implement improvements (see 10.4).

10.2 Evaluation criteria identification for the Information Security Measurement Programme
The organization should define criteria for evaluating effectiveness of the Information Security Measurement
Programme as well as usefulness of developed measurement results. The criteria should be defined at the
beginning of Information Security Measurement Programme implementation, taking into account the context of
the technical and business objectives of the organization.
The most likely criteria when organizations should evaluate and improve implemented Information Security
Measurement Programme are:
- Changes in business objectives of the organization;
- Changes to legal or regulatory requirements and contractual obligations on information security;
- Changes in organization’s requirements on information security;
- Changes in information security risks to the organization;
- Increased availability of more refined or suitable data and/or methods to collect data for measurement
purposes; and
- Changes to the object of measurement and/or its attributes;
The following criteria may be applied to evaluate the developed measurement results:
a) Measurement results are:
1) Easy to understand;
2) Communicated in a timely manner; and
3) Objective, comparable and reproducible.
b) Established processes for developing measurement results are:
1) Well defined;
2) Easy to operate; and
3) Followed properly.
c) Measurement results are useful for improving information security.
d) Measurement results address corresponding information needs.
10.3 Monitor, review, and evaluate the Information Security Measurement Programme
The organization should monitor, review and evaluate its Information Security Measurement Programme
against the established criteria (see 10.2).
The organization should identify potential needs for improvements of the Information Security Measurement
Programme, including:
a) Revising or removing adopted measurement constructs that are no longer appropriate; and
b) Re-allocating resources to support the Information Security Measurement Programme.
The organization should also identify potential needs for improvements of the implemented ISMS, including its
scope, policies, objectives, controls, processes and procedures; and document management decisions to
allow for comparison and trend analysis during subsequent reviews.
The results of this evaluation and the identified potential needs for improvements should be communicated to
relevant stakeholders to allow decision-making regarding necessary improvements.
The organization should ensure that feedback is sought from stakeholders on the results of this evaluation
and the identified potential needs for improvements. The organization should understand that the feedback is
one of inputs regarding effectiveness of the Information Security Measurement Programme.
10.4 Implement improvements
The organization should ensure that relevant stakeholders identify needed improvements of the Information
Security Measurement Programme (see clause 7.3 e) of ISO/IEC 27001:2005). The identified improvements
should be approved by management. The approved plans should be documented and communicated to
appropriate stakeholders.
The organization should ensure that the approved improvements of the Information Security Measurement
Programme are implemented as planned.
The organization may apply project management techniques to accomplish the improvements.

Object of Measurement and Attributes
Object (entity) that is characterised through the measurement of its
Object of Measurement
attributes. An object may include processes, plans, projects,
resources, and systems, or system components.
Property or characteristic of an object of measurement that can be
Attribute
distinguished quantitatively or qualitatively by human or automated
means.
Base Measure Specification (for each base measure [1...n])
A base measure is defined in terms of an attribute and the specified
measurement method for quantifying it (e.g., number of trained
Base Measure
personnel, number of sites, cumulative cost to date). As data is
collected, a value is assigned to a base measure.
Logical sequence of operations used in quantifying an attribute with
Measurement Method
respect to a specified scale.
Depending on the nature of the operations used to quantify an
attribute, two types of method may be distinguished:
Type of Measurement
- Subjective: quantification involving human judgment.
Method
- Objective: quantification based on numerical rules such as
counting.
Ordered set of values or categories to which the base measure’s
Scale
attribute is mapped.
Type of Scale
Depending on the nature of the relationship between values on the
scale, four types of scale are commonly defined: Nominal, Ordinal,
Interval and Ratio.
Unit of Measurement
Particular quantity, defined and adopted by convention, with which any
other quantity of the same kind can be compared to express the ratio
of the two quantities as a number.
Derived Measure Specification
A measure that is derived as a function of two or more base
Derived Measure
measures.
Algorithm or calculation performed to combine two or more base
measures. The scale and unit of the derived measure depend on the
Measurement Function
scales and units of the base measures from which it is composed of as
well as how they are combined by the function.

Indicator Specification
Measure that provides an estimate or evaluation of specified attributes
derived from an analytical model with respect to a defined information
need. Indicators are the basis for analysis and decision making.
Algorithm or calculation combining one or more base and/or derived
measures with associated decision criteria. It is based on an
understanding of, or assumptions about, the expected relationship
between the base and/or the derived measure and/or their behaviour
over time. An analytical model produces estimates or evaluations
relevant to a defined information need.

Decision Criteria Specification
Control objective is achieved and no action required if the resulting
ratio is above 0.9. If the resulting ratio is between 0.8 and 0.9 the
control objective is not achieved, but positive trend indicates
improvement. If the resulting ratio is below 0.8 immediate action
should be taken.

Decision Criteria
Measurement Results

Interpretation for the indicator a) should be as follows:
y The organization criteria for compliance with organizational
password policy are met satisfactorily at the ratios>0.9.
y The organization criteria for compliance with organizational
password policy are met unsatisfactorily at [0.8≤the ratio≤0.9].
y The organization criteria for compliance with organizational
password policy are not met at the ratio<0.8.
Interpretation of Indicators b) should be as follows :
y Upward trend indicates improved compliance, downward trend
indicate deteriorating compliance.
y The degree of trend change may provide insights into the
effectiveness of implemented controls.
y Negative trend may require further controls such as awareness, or
technical means to force for selection of robust passwords or
changing passwords periodically.
y Positive trends should be examined to estimate necessary terms to
meet password policy from current ratio.
The effect/impact of the criteria not being met is increased risk of
confidentiality breaches.
Potential causes of deviation include lack of security awareness,
technical implementation deficiencies, and lack of time for
implementing on all IT systems.

Decision Criteria Specification
Control objective is achieved and no action required if the resulting
ratio is above 0.9. If the resulting ratio is between 0.8 and 0.9 the
control objective is not achieved, but positive trend indicates
improvement. If the resulting ratio is below 0.8 immediate action
should be taken.

Decision Criteria
Measurement Results

Interpretation for the indicator 1 should be as follows:
y The organization criteria for compliance with organizational
password policy are met satisfactorily at the ratios>0.9.
y The organization criteria for compliance with organizational
password policy are met unsatisfactorily at [0.8≤the ratio≤0.9].
y The organization criteria for compliance with organizational
password policy are not met at the ratio<0.8.
Interpretation of Indicators b) should be as follows :
y Upward trend indicates improved compliance, downward trend
indicate deteriorating compliance.
y The degree of trend change may provide insights into the
effectiveness of implemented controls.
y Negative trend may require further controls such as awareness, or
technical means to force for selection of robust passwords or
changing passwords periodically.
y Positive trends should be examined to estimate necessary terms to
meet password policy from current ratio.
The effect/impact of the criteria not being met is increased risk of
password compromise that may lead to unauthorized system access.
Potential causes of deviation include lack of security awareness,
technical implementation deficiencies, and lack of time for
implementing on all IT systems.

nonconformities with the ISMS requirements in order to prevent
recurrence.

Control (1)/process (1)

The documented procedure for corrective action shall define
requirements for:
a) identifying nonconformities;
b) determining the causes of nonconformities;
c) evaluating the need for actions to ensure that nonconformities do
not recur;
d) determining and implementing the corrective action needed;
e) recording results of action taken (see 4.3.3); and
f) reviewing of corrective action taken.
(implemented)
……..
The organization determines the corrective actions required, and
issues the corrective action report documenting information regarding
non-conformity, its cause, and the due date for the corrective action to
be taken.
Upon receiving the report, the manager responsible for the area where
the non-conformity is detected is required to ensure that actions are
taken without undue delay to eliminate detected non-conformities and
their causes.
If corrective action is not implemented as required, the cause of nonimplementation has to be identified, as well as alternatives to the
original corrective action that would be determined to be appropriate.
The actions taken with the corresponding date and results should be
documented. If the corrective action is not implemented as planned
the reason and the alternative action have to be documented. The
report should be provided to Information Security Manager.

should be presented in comparison with previous indicators so that the
trend in corrective action implementation can be examined.
Measurement Results
Interpretation for the indicator a) and b) should be as follows:
Planned corrective actions must be implemented unless the
organization’s priorities have changed that would result in the need to
implement different corrective actions or redirection of resources
allocated to corrective action implementation. If over 40% of corrective
actions are not implemented regardless of the reason, management
action is required. If over 20% of corrective actions are not
implemented without a good reason, management action is required.
Corrective actions that were not implemented should be examined to
identify reasons for non-implementation. Depending on the overall
percentage not implemented and reasons for non implementation,
further action may be required.
Indicator Interpretation

Reporting Formats

Interpretation for the indicator c) should be as follows:
A trend in corrective action implementation should be examined for
any overall deterioration in performance or for significant improvement
in performance.
If percentage of implemented corrective action has been steadily
declining for the last 2 reporting periods, management action is
required regardless of the breakdown in the reasons for noncompliance.
The effects/impact of criteria not being met is potential lack of
continual ISMS improvement.
The potential causes may include lack of resources, incorrect
planning, and lack of critical personnel and management commitment.

if it fails, it should be still over 0.5 to conclude the least achievement.
With regard to indicator b), Computed confidence limits based on the
standard deviation indicate the likelihood that an actual result close to
the average participation rate will be achieved. Very wide confidence
limits suggest a potentially large departure and the need for
contingency planning to deal with this outcome.

Interpretation for the indicator a) should be as follows:
The organization’s criteria for managing information security within the
organization thorough management review have been met
satisfactorily at 0.7≤ the ratio≤1.1 ;
The organization criteria have been met unsatisfactorily at [0.5≤the
ratio<0.7 or the ratio>1.1]. This result may indicate possible lack of
management commitment and may require corrective action.
Subsequent measurement results should be monitored and evaluated
for improvement.
The organization criteria are not met at [0≤ the ratio<0.5]. This result
indicates lack of management commitment and requires immediate
intervention to implement an appropriate corrective action. Senior
management should be notified of the result. The ratio close to 0 may
indicate lack of senior management commitment. If ISMS managers
do not view ISMS management reviews as a priority, they may be
influenced by senior management.

Indicator Interpretation

The effects/impact of the criteria not being met is potential lack of a
continual and effective management review process.
Potential causes of deviation in indicator b) may include incorrect
planning, insufficient commitment of Managers responsible for an
ISMS, conflicting priorities and/or overwork effecting ISMS Managers.

Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27005 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.
This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO/IEC 27005:2008) which has been technically
revised.

Introduction
This International Standard provides guidelines for information security risk management in an organization,
supporting in particular the requirements of an information security management (ISMS) according to
ISO/IEC 27001. However, this International Standard does not provide any specific method for information
security risk management. It is up to the organization to define their approach to risk management, depending
for example on the scope of the ISMS, context of risk management, or industry sector. A number of existing
methodologies can be used under the framework described in this International Standard to implement the
requirements of an ISMS.
This International Standard is relevant to managers and staff concerned with information security risk
management within an organization and, where appropriate, external parties supporting such activities.

Terms and definitions

For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in ISO/IEC 27000 and the following apply.
NOTE

Differences in definitions between ISO/IEC 27005:2008 and this International Standard are shown in Annex G.

3.1
consequence
outcome of an event (3.3) affecting objectives
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE 1

An event can lead to a range of consequences.

NOTE 2

A consequence can be certain or uncertain and in the context of information security is usually negative.

NOTE 3

Consequences can be expressed qualitatively or quantitatively.

NOTE 4

Initial consequences can escalate through knock-on effects.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

3.2
control
measure that is modifying risk (3.9)
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE 1
Controls for information security include any process, policy, procedure, guideline, practice or organizational
structure, which can be administrative, technical, management, or legal in nature which modify information security risk.
NOTE 2

Controls may not always exert the intended or assumed modifying effect.

NOTE 3

Control is also used as a synonym for safeguard or countermeasure.

3.3
event
occurrence or change of a particular set of circumstances
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE 1

An event can be one or more occurrences, and can have several causes.

NOTE 2

An event can consist of something not happening.

NOTE 3

An event can sometimes be referred to as an “incident” or “accident”.

3.4
external context
external environment in which the organization seeks to achieve its objectives
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE

External context can include:
⎯

the cultural, social, political, legal, regulatory, financial, technological, economic, natural and
competitive environment, whether international, national, regional or local;

⎯

key drivers and trends having impact on the objectives of the organization; and

⎯

relationships with, and perceptions and values of, external stakeholders.

3.5
internal context
internal environment in which the organization seeks to achieve its objectives
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE

Internal context can include:
⎯

governance, organizational structure, roles and accountabilities;

⎯

policies, objectives, and the strategies that are in place to achieve them;

⎯

the capabilities, understood in terms of resources and knowledge (e.g. capital, time, people,
processes, systems and technologies);

⎯

information systems, information flows and decision-making processes (both formal and informal);

⎯

relationships with, and perceptions and values of, internal stakeholders;

⎯

the organization's culture;

⎯

standards, guidelines and models adopted by the organization; and

⎯

form and extent of contractual relationships.

3.6
level of risk
magnitude of a risk (3.9), expressed in terms of the combination of consequences (3.1) and their likelihood
(3.7)
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
3.7
likelihood
chance of something happening
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE 1
In risk management terminology, the word “likelihood” is used to refer to the chance of something happening,
whether defined, measured or determined objectively or subjectively, qualitatively or quantitatively, and described using
general terms or mathematically (such as a probability or a frequency over a given time period).
NOTE 2
The English term “likelihood” does not have a direct equivalent in some languages; instead, the equivalent of
the term “probability” is often used. However, in English, “probability” is often narrowly interpreted as a mathematical term.
Therefore, in risk management terminology, “likelihood” is used with the intent that it should have the same broad
interpretation as the term “probability” has in many languages other than English.

3.8
residual risk
risk (3.9) remaining after risk treatment (3.17)
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE 1

Residual risk can contain unidentified risk.

NOTE 2

Residual risk can also be known as “retained risk”.

3.9
risk
effect of uncertainty on objectives
[ISO Guide 73:2009]
NOTE 1

An effect is a deviation from the expected — positive and/or negative.

NOTE 2
Objectives can have different aspects (such as financial, health and safety, information security, and
environmental goals) and can apply at different levels (such as strategic, organization-wide, project, product and process).
NOTE 3
these.

Risk is often characterized by reference to potential events (3.3) and consequences (3.1), or a combination of

NOTE 4
Information security risk is often expressed in terms of a combination of the consequences of an information
security event and the associated likelihood (3.9) of occurrence.
NOTE 5
Uncertainty is the state, even partial, of deficiency of information related to, understanding or knowledge of, an

Background

A systematic approach to information security risk management is necessary to identify organizational needs
regarding information security requirements and to create an effective information security management
system (ISMS). This approach should be suitable for the organization´s environment, and in particular should
be aligned with overall enterprise risk management. Security efforts should address risks in an effective and
timely manner where and when they are needed. Information security risk management should be an integral
part of all information security management activities and should be applied both to the implementation and
the ongoing operation of an ISMS.
Information security risk management should be a continual process. The process should establish the
external and internal context, assess the risks and treat the risks using a risk treatment plan to implement the
recommendations and decisions. Risk management analyses what can happen and what the possible
consequences can be, before deciding what should be done and when, to reduce the risk to an acceptable
level.
Information security risk management should contribute to the following:


Risks being identified



Risks being assessed in terms of their consequences to the business and the likelihood of their
occurrence



The likelihood and consequences of these risks being communicated and understood



Priority order for risk treatment being established



Priority for actions to reduce risks occurring



Stakeholders being involved when risk management decisions are made and kept informed of the risk
management status





Risks and the risk management process being monitored and reviewed regularly



Information being captured to improve the risk management approach



Managers and staff being educated about the risks and the actions taken to mitigate them

The information security risk management process can be applied to the organization as a whole, any discrete
part of the organization (e.g. a department, a physical location, a service), any information system, existing or
planned or particular aspects of control (e.g. business continuity planning).

Overview of the information security risk management process

A high level view of the risk management process is specified in ISO 31000 and shown in Figure 1.

Figure 2 shows how this International Standard applies this risk management process.
The information security risk management process consists of context establishment (Clause 7), risk
assessment (Clause 8), risk treatment (Clause 9), risk acceptance (Clause 10), risk communication and
consultation (Clause 11), and risk monitoring and review (Clause 12).

Figure 2 — Illustration of an information security risk management process
As Figure 2 illustrates, the information security risk management process can be iterative for risk assessment
and/or risk treatment activities. An iterative approach to conducting risk assessment can increase depth and
detail of the assessment at each iteration. The iterative approach provides a good balance between
minimizing the time and effort spent in identifying controls, while still ensuring that high risks are appropriately
assessed.
The context is established first. Then a risk assessment is conducted. If this provides sufficient information to
effectively determine the actions required to modify the risks to an acceptable level then the task is complete
and the risk treatment follows. If the information is insufficient, another iteration of the risk assessment with

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

revised context (e.g. risk evaluation criteria, risk acceptance criteria or impact criteria) will be conducted,
possibly on limited parts of the total scope (see Figure 2, Risk Decision Point 1).
The effectiveness of the risk treatment depends on the results of the risk assessment.
Note that risk treatment involves a cyclical process of:
•
•
•
•

assessing a risk treatment;
deciding whether residual risk levels are acceptable;
generating a new risk treatment if risk levels are not acceptable; and
assessing the effectiveness of that treatment

It is possible that the risk treatment will not immediately lead to an acceptable level of residual risk. In this
situation, another iteration of the risk assessment with changed context parameters (e.g. risk assessment, risk
acceptance or impact criteria), if necessary, may be required, followed by further risk treatment (see Figure 2,
Risk Decision Point 2).
The risk acceptance activity has to ensure residual risks are explicitly accepted by the managers of the
organization. This is especially important in a situation where the implementation of controls is omitted or
postponed, e.g. due to cost.
During the whole information security risk management process it is important that risks and their treatment
are communicated to the appropriate managers and operational staff. Even before the treatment of the risks,
information about identified risks can be very valuable to manage incidents and may help to reduce potential
damage. Awareness by managers and staff of the risks, the nature of the controls in place to mitigate the risks
and the areas of concern to the organization assist in dealing with incidents and unexpected events in the
most effective manner. The detailed results of every activity of the information security risk management
process and from the two risk decision points should be documented.
ISO/IEC 27001 specifies that the controls implemented within the scope, boundaries and context of the ISMS
need to be risk based. The application of an information security risk management process can satisfy this
requirement. There are many approaches by which the process can be successfully implemented in an
organization. The organization should use whatever approach best suits their circumstances for each specific
application of the process.
In an ISMS, establishing the context, risk assessment, developing risk treatment plan and risk acceptance are
all part of the “plan” phase. In the “do” phase of the ISMS, the actions and controls required to reduce the risk
to an acceptable level are implemented according to the risk treatment plan. In the “check” phase of the ISMS,
managers will determine the need for revisions of the risk assessment and risk treatment in the light of
incidents and changes in circumstances. In the ”act” phase, any actions required, including additional
application of the information security risk management process, are performed.
The following table summarizes the information security risk management activities relevant to the four
phases of the ISMS process:

Context establishment

7.1

General considerations

Input: All information about the organization relevant to the information security risk management context
establishment.
Action: The external and internal context for information security risk management should be established,
which involves setting the basic criteria necessary for information security risk management (7.2), defining the
scope and boundaries (7.3), and establishing an appropriate organization operating the information security
risk management (7.4).
Implementation guidance:
It is essential to determine the purpose of the information security risk management as this affects the overall
process and the context establishment in particular. This purpose can be:






Supporting an ISMS
Legal compliance and evidence of due diligence
Preparation of a business continuity plan
Preparation of an incident response plan
Description of the information security requirements for a product, a service or a mechanism

Implementation guidance for context establishment elements needed to support an ISMS is further discussed in
Clauses 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 below.
NOTE
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 does not use the term “context”. However, all of Clause 7 relates to the requirements
“define the scope and boundaries of the ISMS” [4.2.1 a)], “define an ISMS policy” [4.2.1 b)] and “define the risk
assessment approach” [4.2.1 c)], specified in ISO/IEC 27001:2005.

Output: The specification of basic criteria, the scope and boundaries, and the organization for the information
security risk management process.

7.2

Basic Criteria

7.2.1

Risk management approach

Depending on the scope and objectives of the risk management, different approaches can be applied. The
approach might also be different for each iteration.
An appropriate risk management approach should be selected or developed that addresses basic criteria such
as: risk evaluation criteria, impact criteria, risk acceptance criteria.
Additionally, the organization should assess whether necessary resources are available to:





Perform risk assessment and establish a risk treatment plan
Define and implement policies and procedures, including implementation of the controls selected
Monitor controls
Monitor the information security risk management process

NOTE
See also ISO/IEC 27001:2005 (Clause 5.2.1) concerning the provision of resources for the implementation
and operation of an ISMS.

7.2.2

Risk evaluation criteria

Risk evaluation criteria should be developed for evaluating the organization's information security risk
considering the followings:




The strategic value of the business information process
The criticality of the information assets involved
Legal and regulatory requirements, and contractual obligations

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)




Operational and business importance of availability, confidentiality and integrity
Stakeholders expectations and perceptions, and negative consequences for goodwill and reputation

Additionally, risk evaluation criteria can be used to specify priorities for risk treatment.
7.2.3

Impact criteria

Impact criteria should be developed and specified in terms of the degree of damage or costs to the
organization caused by an information security event considering the following:








Level of classification of the impacted information asset
Breaches of information security (e.g. loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability)
Impaired operations (internal or third parties)
Loss of business and financial value
Disruption of plans and deadlines
Damage of reputation
Breaches of legal, regulatory or contractual requirements

NOTE
See also ISO/IEC 27001:2005 [Clause 4.2.1 d) 4] concerning the impact criteria identification for losses of
confidentiality, integrity and availability.

7.2.4

Risk acceptance criteria

Risk acceptance criteria should be developed and specified. Risk acceptance criteria often depend on the
organization's policies, goals, objectives and the interests of stakeholders.
An organization should define its own scales for levels of risk acceptance. The following should be considered
during development:





Risk acceptance criteria may include multiple thresholds, with a desired target level of risk, but provision
for senior managers to accept risks above this level under defined circumstances
Risk acceptance criteria may be expressed as the ratio of estimated profit (or other business benefit) to
the estimated risk
Different risk acceptance criteria may apply to different classes of risk, e.g. risks that could result in noncompliance with regulations or laws may not be accepted, while acceptance of high risks may be allowed
if this is specified as a contractual requirement
Risk acceptance criteria may include requirements for future additional treatment, e.g. a risk may be
accepted if there is approval and commitment to take action to reduce it to an acceptable level within a
defined time period

Risk acceptance criteria may differ according to how long the risk is expected to exist, e.g. the risk may be
associated with a temporary or short term activity. Risk acceptance criteria should be set up considering the
following:







Business criteria
Legal and regulatory aspects
Operations
Technology
Finance
Social and humanitarian factors

NOTE
Risk acceptance criteria correspond to “criteria for accepting risks and identify the acceptable level of risk”
specified in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Clause 4.2.1 c) 2).

7.3

Scope and boundaries

The organization should define the scope and boundaries of information security risk management.
The scope of the information security risk management process needs to be defined to ensure that all relevant
assets are taken into account in the risk assessment. In addition, the boundaries need to be identified
[see also ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Clause 4.2.1 a)] to address those risks that might arise through these
boundaries.
Information about the organization should be collected to determine the environment it operates in and its
relevance to the information security risk management process.
When defining the scope and boundaries, the organization should consider the following information:













The organization's strategic business objectives, strategies and policies
Business processes
The organization’s functions and structure
Legal, regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to the organization
The organization's information security policy
The organization’s overall approach to risk management
Information assets
Locations of the organization and their geographical characteristics
Constraints affecting the organization
Expectation of stakeholders
Socio-cultural environment
Interfaces (i.e. information exchange with the environment)

Additionally, the organization should provide justification for any exclusion from the scope.
Examples of the risk management scope may be an IT application, IT infrastructure, a business process, or a
defined part of an organization.
NOTE
The scope and boundaries of the information security risk management is related to the scope and boundaries
of the ISMS required in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 4.2.1 a).

Further information can be found in Annex A.

7.4

Organization for information security risk management

The organization and responsibilities for the information security risk management process should be set up
and maintained. The following are the main roles and responsibilities of this organization:







Development of the information security risk management process suitable for the organization
Identification and analysis of the stakeholders
Definition of roles and responsibilities of all parties both internal and external to the organization
Establishment of the required relationships between the organization and stakeholders, as well as
interfaces to the organization's high level risk management functions (e.g. operational risk management),
as well as interfaces to other relevant projects or activities
Definition of decision escalation paths
Specification of records to be kept

This organization should be approved by the appropriate managers of the organization.
NOTE
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 requires determination and provision of the resources needed to establish, implement,
operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve an ISMS [5.2.1 a)]. The organization for risk management operations may
be regarded as one of the resources required by ISO/IEC 27001:2005.

Information security risk assessment

8.1

General description of information security risk assessment

NOTE

Risk assessment activity is referred to as process in ISO/IEC 27001:2005.

Input: Basic criteria, the scope and boundaries, and the organization for the information security risk
management process being established.
Action: Risks should be identified, quantified or qualitatively described, and prioritized against risk evaluation
criteria and objectives relevant to the organization.
Implementation guidance:
A risk is a combination of the consequences that would follow from the occurrence of an unwanted event and
the likelihood of the occurrence of the event. Risk assessment quantifies or qualitatively describes the risk and
enables managers to prioritize risks according to their perceived seriousness or other established criteria.
Risk assessment consists of the following activities:




Risk Identification (clause 8.2)
Risk analysis (clause 8.3)
Risk evaluation (clause 8.4)

Risk assessment determines the value of the information assets, identifies the applicable threats and
vulnerabilities that exist (or could exist), identifies the existing controls and their effect on the risk identified,
determines the potential consequences and finally prioritizes the derived risks and ranks them against the risk
evaluation criteria set in the context establishment.
Risk assessment is often conducted in two (or more) iterations. First a high level assessment is carried out to
identify potentially high risks that warrant further assessment. The next iteration can involve further in-depth
consideration of potentially high risks revealed in the initial iteration. Where this provides insufficient
information to assess the risk then further detailed analyses are conducted, probably on parts of the total
scope, and possibly using a different method.
It is up to the organization to select its own approach to risk assessment based on the objectives and the aim
of the risk assessment.
Discussion on information security risk assessment approaches can be found in Annex E.
Output: A list of assessed risks prioritized according to risk evaluation criteria.

8.2
8.2.1

Risk identification
Introduction to risk identification

The purpose of risk identification is to determine what could happen to cause a potential loss, and to gain
insight into how, where and why the loss might happen. The steps described in the following subclauses of 8.2
should collect input data for the risk analysis activity.
Risk identification should include risks whether or not their source is under the control of the organization,
even though the risk source or cause may not be evident.
NOTE
Activities described in subsequent clauses may be conducted in a different order depending on the
methodology applied.

8.2.2

Identification of assets

Input: Scope and boundaries for the risk assessment to be conducted, list of constituents with owners,
location, function, etc.
Action: The assets within the established scope should be identified (relates to ISO/IEC 27001:2005,
Clause 4.2.1 d) 1)).
Implementation guidance:
An asset is anything that has value to the organization and which therefore requires protection. For the
identification of assets it should be borne in mind that an information system consists of more than hardware
and software.
Asset identification should be performed at a suitable level of detail that provides sufficient information for the
risk assessment. The level of detail used on the asset identification will influence the overall amount of
information collected during the risk assessment. The level can be refined in further iterations of the risk
assessment.
An asset owner should be identified for each asset, to provide responsibility and accountability for the asset.
The asset owner may not have property rights to the asset, but has responsibility for its production,
development, maintenance, use and security as appropriate. The asset owner is often the most suitable
person to determine the asset’s value to the organization (see 8.3.2 for asset valuation).
The review boundary is the perimeter of assets of the organization defined to be managed by the information
security risk management process.
More information on the identification and valuation of assets as related to information security can be found in
Annex B.
Output: A list of assets to be risk-managed, and a list of business processes related to assets and their
relevance.
8.2.3

Identification of threats

Input: Information on threats obtained from incident reviewing, asset owners, users and other sources,
including external threat catalogues.
Action: Threats and their sources should be identified (relates to ISO/IEC 27001:2005, Clause 4.2.1 d) 2)).
Implementation guidance:
A threat has the potential to harm assets such as information, processes and systems and therefore
organizations. Threats may be of natural or human origin, and could be accidental or deliberate. Both
accidental and deliberate threat sources should be identified. A threat may arise from within or from outside
the organization. Threats should be identified generically and by type (e.g. unauthorized actions, physical
damage, technical failures) and then where appropriate individual threats within the generic class identified.
This means no threat is overlooked, including the unexpected, but the volume of work required is limited.
Some threats may affect more than one asset. In such cases they may cause different impacts depending on
which assets are affected.
Input to the threat identification and estimation of the likelihood of occurrence (see 8.3.3) may be obtained
from the asset owners or users, from human resources staff, from facility management and information
security specialists, physical security experts, legal department and other organizations including legal bodies,
weather authorities, insurance companies and national government authorities. Aspects of environment and
culture should also be considered when addressing threats.

Internal experience from incidents and past threat assessments should be considered in the current
assessment. It might be worthwhile to consult other threat catalogues (maybe specific to an organization or
business) to complete the list of generic threats, where relevant. Threat catalogues and statistics are available
from industry bodies, national governments, legal bodies, insurance companies etc.
When using threat catalogues, or the results of earlier threat assessments, one should be aware that there is
continual change of relevant threats, especially if the business environment or information systems change.
More information on threat types can be found in Annex C.
Output: A list of threats with the identification of threat type and source.
8.2.4

Identification of existing controls

Input: Documentation of controls, risk treatment implementation plans.
Action: Existing and planned controls should be identified.
Implementation guidance:
Identification of existing controls should be made to avoid unnecessary work or cost, e.g. in the duplication of
controls. In addition, while identifying the existing controls, a check should be made to ensure that the controls
are working correctly – a reference to already existing ISMS audit reports should limit the time expended in
this task. If a control does not work as expected, this may cause vulnerabilities. Consideration should be given
to the situation where a selected control (or strategy) fails in operation and therefore complementary controls
are required to address the identified risk effectively. In an ISMS, according to ISO/IEC 27001, this is
supported by the measurement of control effectiveness. A way to estimate the effect of the control is to see
how it reduces the threat likelihood and ease of exploiting the vulnerability, or impact of the incident.
Management reviews and audit reports also provide information about the effectiveness of existing controls.
Controls that are planned to be implemented according to the risk treatment implementation plans should be
considered in the same way like those already implemented.
An existing or planned control might be identified as ineffective, or not sufficient, or not justified. If not justified
or not sufficient, the control should be checked to determine whether it should be removed, replaced by
another, more suitable control, or whether it should stay in place, for example, for cost reasons.
For the identification of existing or planned controls, the following activities can be helpful:





Reviewing documents containing information about the controls (for example, risk treatment
implementation plans). If the processes of information security management are well documented all
existing or planned controls and the status of their implementation should be available;
Checking with the people responsible for information security (e.g. information security officer and
information system security officer, building manager or operations manager) and the users as to which
controls are really implemented for the information process or information system under consideration;
Conducting an on-site review of the physical controls, comparing those implemented with the list of what
controls should be there, and checking those implemented as to whether they are working correctly and
effectively, or
Reviewing results of audits

Output: A list of all existing and planned controls, their implementation and usage status.
8.2.5

Identification of vulnerabilities

Input: A list of known threats, lists of assets and existing controls.
Action: Vulnerabilities that can be exploited by threats to cause harm to assets or to the organization should
be identified (relates to ISO/IEC 27001:2005, Clause 4.2.1 d) 3)).

The presence of a vulnerability does not cause harm in itself, as there needs to be a threat present to exploit
it. A vulnerability that has no corresponding threat may not require the implementation of a control, but should
be recognized and monitored for changes. It should be noted that an incorrectly implemented or
malfunctioning control or control being used incorrectly could itself be a vulnerability. A control can be effective
or ineffective depending on the environment in which it operates. Conversely, a threat that does not have a
corresponding vulnerability may not result in a risk.
Vulnerabilities can be related to properties of the asset that can be used in a way, or for a purpose, other than
that intended when the asset was purchased or made. Vulnerabilities arising from different sources need to be
considered, for example, those intrinsic or extrinsic to the asset.
Examples of vulnerabilities and methods for vulnerability assessment can be found in Annex D.
Output: A list of vulnerabilities in relation to assets, threats and controls; a list of vulnerabilities that do not
relate to any identified threat for review.
8.2.6

Identification of consequences

Input: A list of assets, a list of business processes, and a list of threats and vulnerabilities, where appropriate,
related to assets and their relevance.
Action: The consequences that losses of confidentiality, integrity and availability may have on the assets
should be identified (see ISO/IEC 27001:2005 4.2.1 d) 4)).
Implementation guidance:
A consequence can be loss of effectiveness, adverse operating conditions, loss of business, reputation,
damage, etc.
This activity identifies the damage or consequences to the organization that could be caused by an incident
scenario. An incident scenario is the description of a threat exploiting a certain vulnerability or set of
vulnerabilities in an information security incident (see ISO/IEC 27002:2005, Clause 13). The impact of the
incident scenarios is to be determined considering impact criteria defined during the context establishment
activity. It may affect one or more assets or part of an asset. Thus assets may have assigned values both for
their financial cost and because of the business consequences if they are damaged or compromised.
Consequences may be of a temporary nature or may be permanent as in the case of the destruction of an
asset.
NOTE

ISO/IEC 27001:2005 describes the occurrence of incident scenarios as “security failures".

Organizations should identify the operational consequences of incident scenarios in terms of (but not limited
to):

8.3

Risk analysis

8.3.1

Risk analysis methodologies

Risk analysis may be undertaken in varying degrees of detail depending on the criticality of assets, extent of
vulnerabilities known, and prior incidents involving in the organization. A risk analysis methodology may be
qualitative or quantitative, or a combination of these, depending on the circumstances. In practice, qualitative
analysis is often used first to obtain a general indication of the level of risk and to reveal the major risks. Later
it may be necessary to undertake more specific or quantitative analysis on the major risks because it is usually
less complex and less expensive to perform qualitative than quantitative analysis.
The form of analysis should be consistent with the risk evaluation criteria developed as part of establishing the
context.
Further details of analysis methodologies are now described:
(a) Qualitative risk analysis:
Qualitative risk analysis uses a scale of qualifying attributes to describe the magnitude of potential
consequences (e.g. Low, Medium and High) and the likelihood that those consequences will occur. An
advantage of qualitative analysis is its ease of understanding by all relevant personnel while a disadvantage is
the dependence on subjective choice of the scale.
These scales can be adapted or adjusted to suit the circumstances and different descriptions may be used for
different risks. Qualitative risk analysis may be used:




As an initial screening activity to identify risks that require more detailed analysis
Where this kind of analysis is appropriate for decisions
Where the numerical data or resources are inadequate for a quantitative risk analysis

Qualitative analysis should use factual information and data where available.
(b) Quantitative risk analysis:
Quantitative risk analysis uses a scale with numerical values (rather than the descriptive scales used in
qualitative risk analysis) for both consequences and likelihood, using data from a variety of sources. The
quality of the analysis depends on the accuracy and completeness of the numerical values and the validity of
the models used. Quantitative risk analysis in most cases uses historical incident data, providing the
advantage that it can be related directly to the information security objectives and concerns of the
organization. A disadvantage is the lack of such data on new risks or information security weaknesses. A
disadvantage of the quantitative approach may occur where factual, auditable data is not available thus
creating an illusion of worth and accuracy of the risk assessment.
The way in which consequences and likelihood are expressed and the ways in which they are combined to
provide a level of risk will vary according to the type of risk and the purpose for which the risk assessment
output is to be used. The uncertainty and variability of both consequences and likelihood should be
considered in the analysis and communicated effectively.

8.3.2

Assessment of consequences

Input: A list of identified relevant incident scenarios, including identification of threats, vulnerabilities, affected
assets, consequences to assets and business processes.
Action: The business impact upon the organization that might result from possible or actual information
security incidents should be assessed, taking into account the consequences of a breach of information
security such as loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability of the assets (relates to ISO/IEC 27001:2005,
Clause 4.2.1 e) 1)).
Implementation Guidance:
After identifying all assets under review, values assigned to these assets should be taken into account while
assessing the consequences.
The business impact value can be expressed in qualitative and quantitative forms, but any method of
assigning monetary value may generally provide more information for decision making and hence facilitate a
more efficient decision making process.
Asset valuation begins with classification of assets according to their criticality, in terms of the importance of
assets to fulfilling the business objectives of the organization. Valuation is then determined using two
measures:



the replacement value of the asset: the cost of recovery cleanup and replacing the information (if at all
possible), and
the business consequences of loss or compromise of the asset, such as the potential adverse business
and/or legal or regulatory consequences from the disclosure, modification, non-availability and/or
destruction of information, and other information assets

This valuation can be determined from a business impact analysis. The value, determined by the
consequence for business, is usually significantly higher than the simple replacement cost, depending on the
importance of the asset to the organization in meeting its business objectives.
Asset valuation is a key factor in the impact assessment of an incident scenario, because the incident may
affect more than one asset (e.g. dependent assets), or only a part of an asset. Different threats and
vulnerabilities will have different impacts on assets, such as a loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability.
Assessment of consequences is thus related to asset valuation based on the business impact analysis.
Consequences or business impact may be determined by modelling the outcomes of an event or set of
events, or by extrapolation from experimental studies or past data.
Consequences may be expressed in terms of monetary, technical or human impact criteria, or other criteria
relevant to the organization. In some cases, more than one numerical value is required to specify
consequences for different times, places, groups or situations.
Consequences in time and finance should be measured with the same approach used for threat likelihood and
vulnerability. Consistency has to be maintained on the quantitative or the qualitative approach.
More information both on asset valuation and impact assessment can be found in Annex B.
Output: A list of assessed consequences of an incident scenario expressed with respect to assets and impact
criteria.
8.3.3

Assessment of incident likelihood

Input: A list of identified relevant incident scenarios, including identification of threats, affected assets,
exploited vulnerabilities and consequences to assets and business processes. Furthermore, lists of all existing
and planned controls, their effectiveness, implementation and usage status.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Action: The likelihood of the incident scenarios should be assessed (relates to ISO/IEC 27001:2005,
Clause 4.2.1 e) 2)).
Implementation guidance:
After identifying the incident scenarios, it is necessary to assess the likelihood of each scenario and impact
occurring, using qualitative or quantitative analysis techniques. This should take account of how often the
threats occur and how easily the vulnerabilities may be exploited, considering:








experience and applicable statistics for threat likelihood
for deliberate threat sources: the motivation and capabilities, which will change over time, and resources
available to possible attackers, as well as the perception of attractiveness and vulnerability of assets for a
possible attacker
for accidental threat sources: geographical factors e.g. proximity to chemical or petroleum plants, the
possibility of extreme weather conditions, and factors that could influence human errors and equipment
malfunction
vulnerabilities, both individually and in aggregation
existing controls and how effectively they reduce vulnerabilities

For instance, an information system may have a vulnerability to the threats of masquerading of user identity
and misuse of resources. The vulnerability of masquerading of user identity may be high because of lack of
user authentication. On the other hand, the likelihood of misuse of resources may be low, despite lack of user
authentication, because ways to misuse resources are limited.
Depending on the need for accuracy, assets could be grouped, or it might be necessary to split assets into
their elements and relate the scenarios to the elements. For example, across geographical locations, the
nature of threats to the same types of assets may change, or the effectiveness of existing controls may vary.
Output: Likelihood of incident scenarios (quantitative or qualitative).
8.3.4

Level of risk determination

Input: A list of incident scenarios with their consequences related to assets and business processes and their
likelihood (quantitative or qualitative).
Action: The level of risk should be determined for all relevant incident scenarios (relates to
ISO/IEC 27001:2005, Clause 4.2.1 e) 4)).
Implementation guidance:
Risk analysis assigns values to the likelihood and the consequences of a risk. These values may be
quantitative or qualitative. Risk analysis is based on assessed consequences and likelihood. Additionally, it
can consider cost benefit, the concerns of stakeholders, and other variables, as appropriate for risk
evaluation. The estimated risk is a combination of the likelihood of an incident scenario and its consequences.
Examples of different information security risk analysis methods or approaches can be found in Annex E.
Output: A list of risks with value levels assigned.

8.4

Risk evaluation

Input: A list of risks with value levels assigned and risk evaluation criteria.
Action: Level of risks should be compared against risk evaluation criteria and risk acceptance criteria (relates
to ISO/IEC 27001:2005, Clause 4.2.1 e) 4)).

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Implementation guidance:
The nature of the decisions pertaining to risk evaluation and risk evaluation criteria that will be used to make
those decisions would have been decided when establishing the context. These decisions and the context
should be revisited in more detail at this stage when more is known about the particular risks identified. To
evaluate risks, organizations should compare the estimated risks (using selected methods or approaches as
discussed in Annex E) with the risk evaluation criteria defined during the context establishment.
Risk evaluation criteria used to make decisions should be consistent with the defined external and internal
information security risk management context and take into account the objectives of the organization and
stakeholder views etc. Decisions as taken in the risk evaluation activity are mainly based on the acceptable
level of risk. However, consequences, likelihood, and the degree of confidence in the risk identification and
analysis should be considered as well. Aggregation of multiple low or medium risks may result in much higher
overall risks and need to be addressed accordingly.
Considerations should include:


Information security properties: if one criterion is not relevant for the organization (e.g. loss of
confidentiality), then all risks impacting this criterion may not be relevant



The importance of the business process or activity supported by a particular asset or set of assets: if the
process is determined to be of low importance, risks associated with it should be given a lower
consideration than risks that impact more important processes or activities

Risk evaluation uses the understanding of risk obtained by risk analysis to make decisions about future
actions. Decisions should include:



Whether an activity should be undertaken
Priorities for risk treatment considering estimated levels of risks

During the risk evaluation stage, contractual, legal and regulatory requirements are factors that should be
taken into account in addition to the estimated risks.
Output: A list of risks prioritized according to risk evaluation criteria in relation to the incident scenarios that
lead to those risks.

Information security risk treatment

9.1

General description of risk treatment

Input: A list of risks prioritized according to risk evaluation criteria in relation to the incident scenarios that lead
to those risks.
Action: Controls to reduce, retain, avoid, or share the risks should be selected and a risk treatment plan
defined.
Implementation guidance:
There are four options available for risk treatment: risk modification (see 9.2), risk retention (see 9.3), risk
avoidance (see 9.4) and risk sharing (see 9.5).
NOTE

ISO/IEC 27001:2005 4.2.1. f) 2) uses the term “accepting risk” instead of “risk retention”.

Figure 3 illustrates the risk treatment activity within the information security risk management process as
presented in Figure 2.

Figure 3 — The risk treatment activity
Risk treatment options should be selected based on the outcome of the risk assessment, the expected cost
for implementing these options and the expected benefits from these options.
When large reductions in risks may be obtained with relatively low expenditure, such options should be
implemented. Further options for improvements may be uneconomic and judgement needs to be exercised as
to whether they are justifiable.
In general, the adverse consequences of risks should be made as low as reasonably practicable and
irrespective of any absolute criteria. Managers should consider rare but severe risks. In such cases, controls
that are not justifiable on strictly economic grounds may need to be implemented (for example, business
continuity controls considered to cover specific high risks).

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

The four options for risk treatment are not mutually exclusive. Sometimes the organization can benefit
substantially by a combination of options such as reducing the likelihood of risks, reducing their
consequences, and sharing or retaining any residual risks.
Some risk treatments can effectively address more than one risk (e.g. information security training and
awareness). A risk treatment plan should be defined which clearly identifies the priority ordering in which
individual risk treatments should be implemented and their timeframes. Priorities can be established using
various techniques, including risk ranking and cost-benefit analysis. It is the organization’s managers’
responsibility to decide the balance between the costs of implementing controls and the budget assignment.
The identification of existing controls may determine that existing controls exceed current needs, in terms of
cost comparisons, including maintenance. If removing redundant or unnecessary controls is considered
(especially if the controls have high maintenance costs), information security and cost factors should be taken
into account. Since controls may influence each other, removing redundant controls might reduce the overall
security in place. In addition, it may be cheaper to leave redundant or unnecessary controls in place than to
remove them.
Risk treatment options should be considered taking into account:



How risk is perceived by affected parties
The most appropriate ways to communicate to those parties

Context establishment (see 7.2 – Risk evaluation criteria) provides information on legal and regulatory
requirements with which the organization needs to comply. The risk to organizations is failure to comply and
treatment options to limit this possibility should be implemented. All constraints - organizational, technical,
structural etc. - that are identified during the context establishment activity should be taken into account during
the risk treatment.
Once the risk treatment plan has been defined, residual risks need to be determined. This involves an update
or re-iteration of the risk assessment, taking into account the expected effects of the proposed risk treatment.
Should the residual risk still not meet the organization's risk acceptance criteria, a further iteration of risk
treatment may be necessary before proceeding to risk acceptance. More information can be found in
ISO/IEC 27002:2005, Clause 0.3.
Output: Risk treatment plan and residual risks subject to the acceptance decision of the organization’s
managers.

9.2

Risk modification

Action: The level of risk should be managed by introducing, removing or altering controls so that the residual
risk can be reassessed as being acceptable.
Implementation guidance:
Appropriate and justified controls should be selected to meet the requirements identified by the risk
assessment and risk treatment. This selection should take account of the risk acceptance criteria as well as
legal, regulatory and contractual requirements. This selection should also take account of cost and timeframe
for implementation of controls, or technical, environmental and cultural aspects. It is often possible to lower
the total cost of ownership of a system with properly selected information security controls.
In general, controls may provide one or more of the following types of protection: correction, elimination,
prevention, impact minimization, deterrence, detection, recovery, monitoring and awareness. During control
selection it is important to weigh the cost of acquisition, implementation, administration, operation, monitoring,
and maintenance of the controls against the value of the assets being protected. Furthermore, the return on
investment in terms of risk reduction and potential to exploit new business opportunities afforded by certain
controls should be considered. Additionally, consideration should be given to specialized skills that may be
needed to define and implement new controls or modify existing ones.
ISO/IEC 27002 provides detailed information on controls.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

There are many constraints that can affect the selection of controls. Technical constraints such as
performance requirements, manageability (operational support requirements) and compatibility issues may
hamper the use of certain controls or could induce human error either nullifying the control, giving a false
sense of security or even increasing the risk beyond not having the control (e.g. requiring complex passwords
without proper training, leading to users writing passwords down). Moreover, it could be the case that a control
would affect performance. Managers should try to identify a solution that satisfies performance requirements
while guaranteeing sufficient information security. The result of this step is a list of possible controls, with their
cost, benefit, and priority of implementation.
Various constraints should be taken into account when selecting controls and during implementation.
Typically, the following are considered:












Time constraints
Financial constraints
Technical constraints
Operational constrains
Cultural constraints
Ethical constraints
Environmental constraints
Legal constraints
Ease of use
Personnel constraints
Constraints for integrating new and existing controls

More information on the constraints for risk modification can be found in Annex F.

9.3

Risk retention

Action: The decision on retaining the risk without further action should be taken depending on risk evaluation.
NOTE
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 4.2.1 f 2) “knowingly and objectively accepting risks, providing they clearly satisfy the
organization’ policies and the criteria for accepting risks” describes the same activity.

Implementation guidance:
If the level of risk meets the risk acceptance criteria, there is no need for implementing additional controls and
the risk can be retained.

9.4

Risk avoidance

Action: The activity or condition that gives rise to the particular risk should be avoided.
Implementation guidance:
When the identified risks are considered too high, or the costs of implementing other risk treatment options
exceed the benefits, a decision may be made to avoid the risk completely, by withdrawing from a planned or
existing activity or set of activities, or changing the conditions under which the activity is operated. For
example, for risks caused by nature it may be most cost effective alternative to physically move the
information processing facilities to a place where the risk does not exist or is under control.

9.5

Risk sharing

Action: The risk should be shared with another party that can most effectively manage the particular risk
depending on risk evaluation.
Implementation guidance:
Risk sharing involves a decision to share certain risks with external parties. Risk sharing can create new risks
or modify existing, identified risks. Therefore, additional risk treatment may be necessary.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Sharing can be done by insurance that will support the consequences, or by sub-contracting a partner whose
role will be to monitor the information system and take immediate actions to stop an attack before it makes a
defined level of damage.
It should be noted that it may be possible to share the responsibility to manage risk but it is not normally
possible to share the liability of an impact. Customers will usually attribute an adverse impact as being the
fault of the organization.

10 Information security risk acceptance
Input: Risk treatment plan and residual risk assessment subject to the acceptance decision of the
organization’s managers.
Action: The decision to accept the risks and responsibilities for the decision should be made and formally
recorded (this relates to ISO/IEC 27001:2005 paragraph 4.2.1 h)).
Implementation guidance:
Risk treatment plans should describe how assessed risks are to be treated to meet risk acceptance criteria
(see Clause 7.2 Risk acceptance criteria). It is important for responsible managers to review and approve
proposed risk treatment plans and resulting residual risks, and record any conditions associated with such
approval.
Risk acceptance criteria can be more complex than just determining whether or not a residual risk falls above
or below a single threshold.
In some cases the level of residual risk may not meet risk acceptance criteria because the criteria being
applied do not take into account prevailing circumstances. For example, it might be argued that it is necessary
to accept risks because the benefits accompanying the risks are very attractive, or because the cost of risk
modification is too high. Such circumstances indicate that risk acceptance criteria are inadequate and should
be revised if possible. However, it is not always possible to revise the risk acceptance criteria in a timely
manner. In such cases, decision makers may have to accept risks that do not meet normal acceptance
criteria. If this is necessary, the decision maker should explicitly comment on the risks and include a
justification for the decision to override normal risk acceptance criteria.
Output: A list of accepted risks with justification for those that do not meet the organization’s normal risk
acceptance criteria.

11 Information security risk communication and consultation
Input: All risk information obtained from the risk management activities (see Figure 2).
Action: Information about risk should be exchanged and/or shared between the decision-maker and other
stakeholders.
Implementation guidance:
Risk communication is an activity to achieve agreement on how to manage risks by exchanging and/or
sharing information about risk between the decision-makers and other stakeholders. The information includes,
but is not limited to the existence, nature, form, likelihood, severity, treatment, and acceptability of risks.
Effective communication among stakeholders is important since this may have a significant impact on
decisions that need to be made. Communication will ensure that those responsible for implementing risk
management, and those with a vested interest understand the basis on which decisions are made and why
particular actions are required. Communication is bi-directional.

Perceptions of risk can vary due to differences in assumptions, concepts and the needs, issues and concerns
of stakeholders as they relate to risk or the issues under discussion. Stakeholders are likely to make
judgments on the acceptability of risk based on their perception of risk. This is especially important to ensure
that the stakeholders’ perceptions of risk, as well as their perceptions of benefits, can be identified and
documented and the underlying reasons clearly understood and addressed.
Risk communication should be carried out in order to achieve the following:










To provide assurance of the outcome of the organization’s risk management
To collect risk information
To share the results from the risk assessment and present the risk treatment plan
To avoid or reduce both occurrence and consequence of information security breaches due to the lack of
mutual understanding among decision makers and stakeholders
To support decision-making
To obtain new information security knowledge
To co-ordinate with other parties and plan responses to reduce consequences of any incident
To give decision makers and stakeholders a sense of responsibility about risks
To improve awareness

An organization should develop risk communication plans for normal operations as well as for emergency
situations. Therefore, risk communication activity should be performed continually.
The co-ordination between major decision makers and stakeholders may be achieved by the formation of a
committee where debate about risks, their prioritization and appropriate treatment, and acceptance can take
place.
It is important to cooperate with the appropriate public relations or communications unit within the organization
to coordinate all tasks related to risk communication. This is crucial in the event of crisis communication
actions, for example, in response to particular incidents.
Output: Continual understanding of the organization’s information security risk management process and
results.

12 Information security risk monitoring and review
12.1 Monitoring and review of risk factors
Input: All risk information obtained from the risk management activities (see Figure 2).
Action: Risks and their factors (i.e. value of assets, impacts, threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood of occurrence)
should be monitored and reviewed to identify any changes in the context of the organization at an early stage,
and to maintain an overview of the complete risk picture.
Implementation guidance:
Risks are not static. Threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood or consequences may change abruptly without any
indication. Therefore constant monitoring is necessary to detect these changes. This may be supported by
external services that provide information regarding new threats or vulnerabilities.
Organizations should ensure that the following are continually monitored:






New assets that have been included in the risk management scope
Necessary modification of asset values, e.g. due to changed business requirements
New threats that could be active both outside and inside the organization and that have not been
assessed
Possibility that new or increased vulnerabilities could allow threats to exploit these new or changed
vulnerabilities
Identified vulnerabilities to determine those becoming exposed to new or re-emerging threats



Increased impact or consequences of assessed threats, vulnerabilities and risks in aggregation resulting
in an unacceptable level of risk
Information security incidents

New threats, vulnerabilities or changes in likelihood or consequences can increase risks previously assessed
as low ones. Review of low and accepted risks should consider each risk separately, and all such risks as an
aggregate as well, to assess their potential accumulated impact. If risks do not fall into the low or acceptable
risk category, they should be treated using one or more of the options considered in Clause 9.
Factors that affect the likelihood and consequences of threats occurring could change, as could factors that
affect the suitability or cost of the various treatment options. Major changes affecting the organization should
be reason for a more specific review. Therefore, the risk monitoring activities should be regularly repeated and
the selected options for risk treatment should be reviewed periodically.
The outcome of risk monitoring activities may be input to other risk review activities. The organization should
review all risks regularly, and when major changes occur (according to ISO/IEC 27001:2005, Clause 4.2.3)).
Output: Continual alignment of the management of risks with the organization’s business objectives, and with
risk acceptance criteria.

12.2 Risk management monitoring, review and improvement
Input: All risk information obtained from the risk management activities (see Figure 2).
Action: The information security risk management process should be continually monitored, reviewed and
improved as necessary and appropriate.
Implementation guidance:
Ongoing monitoring and review is necessary to ensure that the context, the outcome of the risk assessment
and risk treatment, as well as management plans, remain relevant and appropriate to the circumstances.
The organization should make sure that the information security risk management process and related
activities remain appropriate in the present circumstances and are followed. Any agreed improvements to the
process or actions necessary to improve compliance with the process should be notified to the appropriate
managers to have assurance that no risk or risk element is overlooked or underestimated and that the
necessary actions are taken and decisions are made to provide a realistic risk understanding and ability to
respond.
Additionally, the organization should regularly verify that the criteria used to measure the risk and its elements
are still valid and consistent with business objectives, strategies and policies, and that changes to the
business context are taken into consideration adequately during the information security risk management
process. This monitoring and review activity should address (but not be limited to):










Legal and environmental context
Competition context
Risk assessment approach
Asset value and categories
Impact criteria
Risk evaluation criteria
Risk acceptance criteria
Total cost of ownership
Necessary resources

The organization should ensure that risk assessment and risk treatment resources are continually available to
review risk, to address new or changed threats or vulnerabilities, and to advise management accordingly.

Annex A
(informative)
Defining the scope and boundaries of
the information security risk management process

A.1 Study of the organization
Evaluate the organization The study of the organization recalls the characteristic elements defining the identity
of an organization. This concerns the purpose, business, missions, values and strategies of this organization.
These should be identified together with the elements contributing to their development (e.g. subcontracting).
The difficulty of this activity lies in understanding exactly how the organization is structured. Identifying its real
structure will provide an understanding of the role and importance of each division in achieving the
organization's objectives.
For example, the fact that the information security manager reports to the top managers rather than IT
managers may indicate top managers' involvement in information security.
The organization's main purpose The main purpose of an organization can be defined as the reason why it
exists (its field of activity, its market segment, etc.).
Its business The organization's business, defined by the techniques and know-how of its employees, enables
it to accomplish its missions. It is specific to the organization's field of activity and often defines its culture.
Its mission The organization achieves its purpose by accomplishing its mission. To identify its missions, the
services provided and/or products manufactured should be identified in relation to the end users.
Its values Values are major principles or a well-defined code of conduct applied to the exercise of a business.
This may concern the personnel, relations with outside agents (customers, etc.), the quality of products
supplied or services provided.
Take the example of an organization whose purpose is public service, whose business is transport and whose
missions include transporting children to and from school. Its values may be the punctuality of the service and
safety during transport.
Structure of the organization There are different types of structure:



Divisional structure: each division is placed under the authority of a division manager responsible for the
strategic, administrative and operational decisions concerning his unit
Functional structure: functional authority is exercised on the procedures, the nature of the work and
sometimes the decisions or planning (e.g. production, IT, human resources, marketing, etc.)

Remarks:




A division within an organization with divisional structure may be organised as a functional structure and
vice versa
An organization may be said to have a matrix structure if it has elements of both types of structure
In any organizational structure the following levels can be distinguished:
•
the decision-making level (definition of strategic orientations);
•
the leadership level (co-ordination and management);
•
the operational level (production and support activities).

Organization chart The organization's structure is represented schematically in an organization chart. This
representation should highlight the lines of reporting and delegation of authority, but should also include other
relationships, which, even if they are not based on any formal authority, are nevertheless lines of information
flow.
The organization’s strategy This requires a formal expression of the organization's guiding principles. The
organization’s strategy determines the direction and development needed in order to benefit from the issues at
stake and of the major changes it is planning.

A.2 List of the constraints affecting the organization
All the constraints affecting the organization and determining its information security orientation should be
taken into account. Their source may be within the organization in which case it has some control over them
or outside the organization and therefore generally non-negotiable. Resource constraints (budget, personnel)
and emergency constraints are among the most important ones.
The organization sets its objectives (concerning its business, behaviour, etc.) committing it to a certain path,
possibly over a long period. It defines what it wants to become and the means that will need to be
implemented. In specifying this path, the organization takes into account developments in techniques and
know-how, the expressed wishes of users, customers, etc. This objective can be expressed in the form of
operating or development strategies with the aim, for example, of cutting operating costs, improving quality of
service, etc.
These strategies probably include information and the information system (IS), which assist in their
application. Consequently, characteristics concerning the identity, mission and strategies of the organization
are fundamental elements in the analysis of the problem since the breach of an information security aspect
could result in rethinking these strategic objectives. In addition, it is essential that proposals for information
security requirements remain consistent with the rules, uses and means in force in the organization.
The list of constraints includes but is not limited to:
Constraints of a political nature
These may concern government administrations, public institutions or more generally any organization that
has to apply government decisions. They are usually decisions concerning strategic or operational orientation
made by a government division or decision-making body and should be applied.
For example, the computerization of invoices or administrative documents introduces information security
problems.
Constraints of a strategic nature
Constraints can arise from planned or possible changes to the organization's structures or orientation. They
are expressed in the organization's strategic or operational plans.
For example, international co-operation in the sharing of sensitive information may necessitate agreements
concerning secure exchange.
Territorial constraints
The organization's structure and/or purpose may introduce specific constraints such as the distribution of sites
over the entire national territory or abroad.
Examples include postal services, embassies, banks, subsidiaries of a large industrial group, etc.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Constraints arising from the economic and political climate
An organization's operation may be profoundly changed by specific events such as strikes or national and
international crises.
For example, some services should be able to continue even during a serious crisis.
Structural constraints
The nature of an organization's structure (divisional, functional or other) may lead to a specific information
security policy and security organization adapted to the structure.
For example, an international structure should be able to reconcile security requirements specific to each
country.
Functional constraints
Functional constraints arise directly from the organization's general or specific missions.
For example, an organization that operates around the clock should ensure its resources are continuously
available.
Constraints concerning personnel
The nature of these constraints varies considerably. They are linked to: level of responsibility, recruitment,
qualification, training, security awareness, motivation, availability, etc.
For example, the entire personnel of a defence organization should have authorisation to handle highly
confidential information.
Constraints arising from the organization's calendar
These constraints may result from restructuring or setting up new national or international policies imposing
certain deadlines.
For example, the creation of a security division.
Constraints related to methods
Methods appropriate to the organization's know-how will need to be imposed for aspects such as project
planning, specifications, development and so on.
For example, a typical constraint of this kind is the need to incorporate the organization's legal obligations into
the security policy.
Constraints of a cultural nature
In some organizations work habits or the main business have led to a specific “culture” within the organization,
one which may be incompatible with the security controls. This culture is the personnel's general reference
framework and may be determined by many aspects, including education, instruction, professional
experience, experience outside work, opinions, philosophy, beliefs, social status, etc.
Budgetary constraints
The recommended security controls may sometimes have a very high cost. While it is not always appropriate
to base security investments on cost-effectiveness, economic justification is generally required by the
organization’s financial department.
For example, in the private sector and some public organizations, the total cost of security controls should not
exceed the cost of the potential consequences of the risks. Top management should therefore assess and
take calculated risks if they want to avoid excessive security costs.

A.3 List of the legislative and regulatory references applicable to the organization
The regulatory requirements applicable to the organization should be identified. These may be laws, decrees,
specific regulations in the organization's field or internal and/or external regulations. This also concerns
contracts and agreements and more generally any obligations of a legal or regulatory nature.

A.4 List of the constraints affecting the scope
By identifying the constraints it is possible to list those that have an impact on the scope and determine which
are nevertheless amenable to action. They are added to, and may possibly amend, the organization's
constraints determined above. The following paragraphs present a non-exhaustive list of possible types of
constraints.
Constraints arising from pre-existing processes
Application projects are not necessarily developed simultaneously. Some depend on pre-existing processes.
Even though a process can be broken down into sub-processes, the process is not necessarily influenced by
all the sub-processes of another process.
Technical constraints
Technical constraints, relating to infrastructure, generally arise from installed hardware and software, and
rooms or sites housing the processes:








Files (requirements concerning organization, media management, management of access rules, etc.)
General architecture (requirements concerning topology (centralised, distributed, client-server), physical
architecture, etc.)
Application software (requirements concerning specific software design, market standards, etc.);
Package software (requirements concerning standards, level of evaluation, quality, compliance with
norms, security, etc.)
Hardware (requirements concerning standards, quality, compliance with norms, etc.)
Communication networks (requirements concerning coverage, standards, capacity, reliability, etc.)
Building infrastructure (requirements concerning civil engineering, construction, high voltages, low
voltages, etc.)

Financial constraints
The implementation of security controls is often restricted by the budget that the organization can commit.
However, the financial constraint should still to be the last to be considered as the budget allocation for
security can be negotiated on the basis of the security study.
Environmental constraints
Environmental constraints arise from the geographical or economic environment in which the processes are
implemented: country, climate, natural risks, geographical situation, economic climate, etc.
Time constraints
The time required for implementing security controls should be considered in relation to the ability to upgrade
the information system; if the implementation time is very long, the risks for which the control was designed
may have changed. Time is a determining factor for selecting solutions and priorities.
Constraints related to methods
Methods appropriate to the organization's know-how should be used for project planning, specifications,
development and so on.

Annex B
(informative)
Identification and valuation of assets and impact assessment

B.1 Examples of asset identification
To perform asset valuation, an organization first needs to identify its assets (at an appropriate level of detail). Two
kinds of assets can be distinguished:


The primary assets:
 Business processes & activities
 Information



The supporting assets (on which the primary elements of the scope rely) of all types:
 Hardware
 Software
 Network
 Personnel
 Site
 Organization’s structure

B.1.1 The identification of primary assets
To describe the scope more accurately, this activity consists in identifying the primary assets (business
processes and activities, information). This identification is carried out by a mixed work group representative
of the process (managers, information systems specialists and users).
The primary assets are usually the core processes and information of the activity in the scope. Other primary
assets such as the organization's processes can also be considered, which will be more appropriate for
drawing up an information security policy or a business continuity plan. Depending on the purpose, some
studies will not require an exhaustive analysis of all the elements making up the scope. In such cases, the
study boundaries can be limited to the key elements of the scope.
Primary assets are of two types:
1 - Business processes (or sub-processes) and activities, for example:





Processes whose loss or degradation make it impossible to carry out the mission of the organization
Processes that contain secret processes or processes involving proprietary technology
Processes that, if modified, can greatly affect the accomplishment of the organization's mission
Processes that are necessary for the organization to comply with contractual, legal or regulatory
requirements

2 – Information:
More generally, primary information mainly comprises:





Vital information for the exercise of the organization's mission or business
Personal information, as can be defined specifically in the sense of the national laws regarding privacy
Strategic information required for achieving objectives determined by the strategic orientations
High-cost information whose gathering, storage, processing and transmission require a long time and/or
involve a high acquisition cost

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Processes and information that are not identified as sensitive after this activity will have no defined
classification in the remainder of the study. This means that even if such processes or information are
compromised, the organization will still accomplish the mission successfully.
However, they will often inherit controls implemented to protect the processes and information identified as
sensitive.

B.1.2 List and description of supporting assets
The scope consists of assets that should be identified and described. These assets have vulnerabilities that
are exploitable by threats aiming to impair the primary assets of the scope (processes and information). They
are of various types:
Hardware
The hardware type consists of all the physical elements supporting processes.
Data processing equipment (active)

conveying or transmitting data.
Examples: printer, removable disc drive.
Data medium (passive)
These are media for storing data or functions.
Electronic medium
An information medium that can be connected to a computer or computer network for data storage.
Despite their compact size, these media may contain a large amount of data. They can be used with
standard computing equipment.
Examples: floppy disc, CD ROM, back-up cartridge, removable hard disc, memory key, tape.
Other media
Static, non-electronic media containing data.
Examples: paper, slide, transparency, documentation, fax.

Operating system
This includes all the programmes of a computer making up the operational base from which all the
other programmes (services or applications) are run. It includes a kernel and basic functions or
services. Depending on the architecture, an operating system may be monolithic or made up of a
micro-kernel and a set of system services. The main elements of the operating system are all the
equipment management services (CPU, memory, disc, and network interfaces), task or process
management services and user rights management services.
Service, maintenance or administration software
Software characterised by the fact that it complements the operating system services and is not directly
at the service of the users or applications (even though it is usually essential or even indispensable for
the global operation of the information system).
Package software or standard software
Standard software or package software are complete products commercialised as such (rather than
one-off or specific developments) with medium, release and maintenance. They provide services for
users and applications, but are not personalised or specific in the way that business applications are.
Examples: data base management software, electronic messaging software, groupware, directory
software, web server software, etc.
Business application
Standard business application
This is commercial software designed to give users direct access to the services and functions
they require from their information system in their professional context. There is a very wide,
theoretically limitless, range of fields.
Examples: accounts software, machine tool control software, customer care software, personnel
competency management software, administrative software, etc.
Specific business application
This is software in which various aspects (primarily support, maintenance, upgrading, etc.) have
been specifically developed to give users direct access to the services and functions they require
from their information system. There is a very wide, theoretically unlimited, range of fields.
Examples: Invoice management of telecom operators' customers, real time monitoring application
for rocket launching.
Network
The network type consists of all telecommunications devices used to interconnect several physically remote
computers or elements of an information system.
Medium and supports
Communications and telecommunications media or equipment are characterised mainly by the
physical and technical characteristics of the equipment (point-to-point, broadcast) and by the
communication protocols (link or network - levels 2 and 3 of the OSI 7-layer model).
Examples: Public Switching Telephone Network (PSTN), Ethernet, GigabitEthernet, Asymmetric
Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), wireless protocol specifications (e.g. WiFi 802.11), Bluetooth,
FireWire.

Passive or active relay
This sub-type includes all devices that are not the logical terminations of communications (IS
vision) but are intermediate or relay devices. Relays are characterised by the supported network
communication protocols. In addition to the basic relay, they often include routing and/or filtering
functions and services, employing communication switches and routers with filters. They can
often be administrated remotely and are usually capable of generating logs.
Examples: bridge, router, hub, switch, automatic exchange.
Communication interface
The communication interfaces of the processing units are connected to the processing units but
are characterised by the media and supported protocols, by any installed filtering, log or warning
generation functions and their capacities and by the possibility and requirement of remote
administration.
Examples: General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Ethernet adaptor.
Personnel
The personnel type consists of all the groups of people involved in the information system.
Decision maker
Decision makers are the owners of the primary assets (information and functions) and the
managers of the organization or specific project.
Examples: top management, project leader.
Users
Users are the personnel who handle sensitive elements in the context of their activity and who
have a special responsibility in this respect. They may have special access rights to the
information system to carry out their everyday tasks.
Examples: human resources management, financial management, risk manager.
Operation/ Maintenance staff
These are the personnel in charge of operating and maintaining the information system. They
have special access rights to the information system to carry out their everyday tasks.
Examples: system administrator, data administrator, back-up, Help Desk, application deployment
operator, security officers.
Developers
Developers are in charge of developing the organization's applications. They have access to part
of the information system with high-level rights but do not take any action on the production data.
Examples: business application developers.
Site
The site type comprises all the places containing the scope or part of the scope, and the physical means
required for it to operate.

Location
External environment
This concerns all locations in which the organization's means of security cannot be applied.
Examples: homes of the personnel, premises of another organization, environment outside
the site (urban area, hazard area).
Premises
This place is bounded by the organization's perimeter directly in contact with the outside.
This may be a physical protective boundary obtained by creating physical barriers or means
of surveillance around buildings.
Examples: establishment, buildings.
Zone
A zone is formed by a physical protective boundary forming partitions within the
organization's premises. It is obtained by creating physical barriers around the
organization's information processing infrastructures.
Examples: offices, reserved access zone, secure zone.
Essential services
All the services required for the organization's equipment to operate.
Communication
Telecommunications services and equipment provided by an operator.
Examples: telephone line, PABX, internal telephone networks.
Utilities
Services and means (sources and wiring) required for providing power to information
technology equipment and peripherals.
Examples: low voltage power supply, inverter, electrical circuit head-end.
Water supply
Waste disposal
Services and means (equipment, control) for cooling and purifying the air.
Examples: chilled water pipes, air-conditioners.
Organization
The organization type describes the organizational framework, consisting of all the personnel structures
assigned to a task and the procedures controlling these structures.

Authorities
These are organizations from which the studied organization derives its authority. They may
be legally affiliated or external. This imposes constraints on the studied organization in
terms of regulations, decisions and actions.
Examples: administrating body, Head office of an organization.
Structure of the organization
This consists of the various branches of the organization, including its cross-functional
activities, under the control of its management.
Examples: human resources management, IT management, purchasing management,
business unit management, building safety service, fire service, audit management.
Project or system organization
This concerns the organization set up for a specific project or service.
Examples: new application development project, information system migration project.
Subcontractors / Suppliers / Manufacturers
These are organizations that provide the organization with a service or resources and
bound to it by contract.
Examples: facilities management company, outsourcing company, consultancy companies.

B.2 Asset valuation
The next step after asset identification is to agree upon the scale to be used and the criteria for assigning a
particular location on that scale to each asset, based on valuation. Because of the diversity of assets found
within most organizations it is likely that some assets that have a known monetary value will be valued in the
local unit of currency while others which have a more qualitative value may be assigned a value ranging, for
example, from ”very low” to ”very high”. The decision to use a quantitative scale versus a qualitative scale is
really a matter of organizational preference, but should be relevant to the assets being valued. Both valuation
types could be used for the same asset.
Typical terms used for the qualitative valuation of assets include words such as: negligible, very low, low,
medium, high, very high, and critical. The choice and range of terms suitable to an organization is strongly
dependent on an organization's needs for security, organizational size, and other organization specific factors.
Criteria
The criteria used as the basis for assigning a value to each asset should be written out in unambiguous terms.
This is often one of the most difficult aspects of asset valuation since the values of some assets may have to
be subjectively determined and since many different individuals are likely to be making the determination.
Possible criteria used to determine an asset’s value include its original cost, its replacement or re-creation
cost or its value may be abstract, e.g. the value of an organization’s reputation.
Another basis for the valuation of assets is the costs incurred due to the loss of confidentiality, integrity and
availability as the result of an incident. Non-repudiation, accountability, authenticity and reliability should also
be considered, as appropriate. Such a valuation would provide the important element dimensions to asset
value, in addition to replacement cost, based on estimates of the adverse business consequences that would
result from security incidents with an assumed set of circumstances. It is emphasized that this approach
accounts for consequences that are necessary to factor into the risk assessment.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Many assets may during the course of valuation have several values assigned. For example: a business plan
may be valued based on the labour expended to develop the plan, it might be valued on the labour to input the
data, and it could be valued based on its value to a competitor. Each of the assigned values will most likely
differ considerably. The assigned value may be the maximum of all possible values or may be the sum of
some or all of the possible values. In the final analysis, which value or values are assigned to an asset should
be carefully determined since the final value assigned enters into the determination of the resources to be
expended for the protection of the asset.
Reduction to the common base
Ultimately, all asset valuations need to be reduced to a common base. This may be done with the aid of
criteria such as those that follow. Criteria that may be used to assess the possible consequences resulting
from a loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, accountability, authenticity, or reliability of
assets are:












Violation of legislation and/or regulation
Impairment of business performance
Loss of goodwill/negative effect on reputation
Breach associated with personal information
Endangerment of personal safety
Adverse effects on law enforcement
Breach of confidentiality
Breach of public order
Financial loss
Disruption to business activities
Endangerment of environmental safety

Another approach to assess the consequences could be:

 damage to reputation
Disruption of internal operation
 disruption in the organization itself
 additional internal cost

 disruption in third parties transacting with the organization
 various types of injury
Infringement of laws / regulations:
 inability to fulfill legal obligations
Breach of contract:
 inability to fulfill contractual obligations
Danger to personnel / user safety:
 danger for the organization's personnel and / or users
Attack on users' private life
Financial losses
Financial costs for emergency or repair:
 in terms of personnel,

Industrial crisis (strikes)
Government crisis
Dismissal
Material damage

These criteria are examples of issues to be considered for asset valuation. For carrying out valuations, an
organization needs to select criteria relevant to its type of business and security requirements. This might
mean that some of the criteria listed above are not applicable, and that others might need to be added to the
list.
Scale
After establishing the criteria to be considered, the organization should agree on a scale to be used
organization-wide. The first step is to decide on the number of levels to be used. There are no rules with
regard to the number of levels that are most appropriate. More levels provide a greater level of granularity but
sometimes a too fine differentiation makes consistent assignments throughout the organization difficult.
Normally, any number of levels between 3 (e.g. low, medium, and high) and 10 can be used as long as it is
consistent with the approach the organization is using for the whole risk assessment process.
An organization may define its own limits for asset values, like “low”, “medium”, or “high”. These limits should
be assessed according to the criteria selected (e.g. for possible financial loss, they should be given in
monetary values, but for considerations such as endangerment of personal safety, monetary valuation can be
complex and may not be appropriate for all organizations). Finally, it is entirely up to the organization to decide
what is considered as being “low” or a “high” consequence. A consequence that might be disastrous for a
small organization could be low or even negligible for a very large organization.
Dependencies
The more relevant and numerous the business processes supported by an asset, the greater the value of this
asset. Dependencies of assets on business processes and other assets should be identified as well since this
might influence the values of the assets. For example, the confidentiality of data should be kept throughout its
life-cycle, at all stages, including storage and processing, i.e. the security needs of data storage and
processing programmes should be directly related to the value representing the confidentiality of the data
stored and processed. Also, if a business process is relying on the integrity of certain data being produced by
a programme, the input data of this programme should be of appropriate reliability. Moreover, the integrity of
information will be dependent on the hardware and software used for its storage and processing. Also, the
hardware will be dependent on the power supply and possibly air conditioning. Thus information about
dependencies will assist in the identification of threats and particularly vulnerabilities. Additionally, it will help
to assure that the true value of the assets (through the dependency relationships) is given to the assets,
thereby indicating the appropriate level of protection.
The values of assets on which other assets are dependent may be modified in the following way:


If the values of the dependent assets (e.g. data) are lower or equal to the value of the asset considered
(e.g. software), its value remains the same



If the values of the dependent asset (e.g. data) is greater, then the value of the asset considered (e.g.
software) should be increased according to:
-

The degree of dependency
The values of the other assets

An organization may have some assets that are available more than once, like copies of software
programmes or the same type of computer used in most of the offices. It is important to consider this fact
when doing the asset valuation. On one hand, these assets are overlooked easily, therefore care should be
taken to identify all of them; on the other hand, they could be used to reduce availability problems.

Output
The final output of this step is a list of assets and their values relative to disclosure (preservation of
confidentiality), modification (preservation of integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation and accountability), nonavailability and destruction (preservation of availability and reliability), and replacement cost.

B.3 Impact assessment
An information security incident can impact more than one asset or only a part of an asset. Impact is related to
the degree of success of the incident. As a consequence, there is an important difference between the asset
value and the impact resulting from the incident. Impact is considered as having either an immediate
(operational) effect or a future (business) effect that includes financial and market consequences.
Immediate (operational) impact is either direct or indirect.
Direct:
a)

The financial replacement value of lost (part of) asset

b)

The cost of acquisition, configuration and installation of the new asset or back-up

c)

The cost of suspended operations due to the incident until the service provided by the asset(s) is restored

d)

Impact results in a information security breach

Indirect:
a)

Opportunity cost (financial resources needed to replace or repair an asset would have been used
elsewhere)

b)

The cost of interrupted operations

c)

Potential misuse of information obtained through a security breach

d)

Violation of statutory or regulatory obligations

e)

Violation of ethical codes of conduct

As such, the first assessment (with no controls of any kind) will estimate an impact as very close to the
(combination of the) concerned asset value(s). For any next iteration for this (these) asset(s), the impact will
be different (normally much lower) due to the presence and the effectiveness of the implemented controls.

D.2 Methods for assessment of technical vulnerabilities
Proactive methods such as information system testing can be used to identify vulnerabilities depending on the
criticality of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) system and available resources
(e.g. allocated funds, available technology, persons with the expertise to conduct the test). Test methods
include:





Automated vulnerability scanning tool
Security testing and evaluation
Penetration testing
Code review

The automated vulnerability scanning tool is used to scan a group of hosts or a network for known vulnerable
services (e.g. system allows anonymous File Transfer Protocol (FTP), sendmail relaying). It should be noted,
however, that some of the potential vulnerabilities identified by the automated scanning tool may not represent
real vulnerabilities in the context of the system environment. For example, some of these scanning tools rate
potential vulnerabilities without considering the site’s environment and requirements. Some of the
vulnerabilities flagged by the automated scanning software may actually not be vulnerable for a particular site
but may be configured that way because their environment requires it. Thus, this test method may produce
false positives.
Security testing and evaluation (STE) is another technique that can be used in identifying ICT system
vulnerabilities during the risk assessment process. It includes the development and execution of a test plan
(e.g. test script, test procedures, and expected test results). The purpose of system security testing is to test
the effectiveness of the security controls of an ICT system as they have been applied in an operational
environment. The objective is to ensure that the applied controls meet the approved security specification for
the software and hardware and implement the organization’s security policy or meet industry standards.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Penetration testing can be used to complement the review of security controls and ensure that different facets
of the ICT system are secured. Penetration testing, when used in the risk assessment process, can be used to
assess an ICT system’s ability to withstand intentional attempts to circumvent system security. Its objective is
to test the ICT system from the viewpoint of a threat source and to identify potential failures in the ICT system
protection schemes.
Code review is the most thorough (but also most expensive) way of vulnerability assessment.
The results of these types of security testing will help identify a system’s vulnerabilities.
It is important to note that penetration tools and techniques can give false results unless the vulnerability is
successfully exploited. To exploit particular vulnerabilities one needs to know the exact system/ application/
patches setup on tested system. If those data are not known at the time of testing, it might not be possible to
successfully exploit particular vulnerability (for example, gaining remote reverse shell); however, it is still
possible to crash or restart a tested process or system. In such a case, the tested object should be considered
vulnerable as well.
Methods may include the following activities:





Interview people and users
Questionnaires
Physical inspection
Document analysis

Annex E
(informative)
Information security risk assessment approaches

E.1 High-level information security risk assessment
The high-level assessment allows definition of the priorities and chronology in the actions. For various
reasons, such as budget, it may not be possible to implement all controls simultaneously and only the most
critical risks can be addressed through the risk treatment process. As well, it can be premature to begin
detailed risk management if implementation is only envisaged after one or two years. To reach this objective,
the high-level assessment may begin with a high-level assessment of consequences instead of starting with a
systematic analysis of threats, vulnerabilities, assets and consequences.
Another reason to start with the high-level assessment is to synchronize with other plans related to change
management (or business continuity). For example, it is not sound to completely secure a system or
application if it is planned to outsource it in the near future, although it may still be worth doing the risk
assessment in order to define the outsource contract.
Features of the high-level risk assessment iteration may include the following:







The high-level risk assessment may address a more global view of the organization and its information
systems, considering the technology aspects as independent from the business issues. By doing this, the
context analysis concentrates more on the business and operational environment than technological
elements.
The high-level risk assessment may address a more limited list of threats, and vulnerabilities grouped in
defined domains or, to expedite the process, it may focus on risk or attack scenarios instead of their
elements.
Risks presented in a high-level risk assessment are frequently more general risk domains than specific
identified risks. As the scenarios or the threats are grouped in domains, the risk treatment proposes lists
of controls in this domain. The risk treatment activities try then first to propose and select common
controls that are valid across the whole system.
However, the high-level risk assessment, because it seldom addresses technology details, is more
appropriate to provide organizational and non-technical controls and management aspects of technical
controls, or key and common technical safeguards such as back-ups and anti-virus.

The advantages of a high-level risk assessment are as follows:




The incorporation of an initial simple approach is likely to gain acceptance of the risk assessment
program.
It should be possible to build a strategic picture of an organizational information security program, i.e. it
will act as a good planning aid.
Resources and money can be applied where they are most beneficial, and systems likely to be in the
greatest need of protection will be addressed first.

As the initial risk analyses are at a high level, and potentially less accurate, the only potential disadvantage is
that some business processes or systems may not be identified as requiring a second, detailed risk
assessment. This can be avoided if there is adequate information on all aspects of the organization and its
information and systems, including information gained from the evaluation of information security incidents.
The high-level risk assessment considers the business values of the information assets, and the risks from the
organization's business point of view. At the first decision point (see Figure 2), several factors assist in
determining whether the high-level assessment is adequate to treat risks; these factors may include the
following:

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)







The business objectives to be achieved by using various information assets;
The degree to which the organization's business depends on each information asset, i.e. whether
functions that the organization considers critical to its survival or the effective conduct of business are
dependent on each asset, or on the confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, accountability,
authenticity, and reliability of the information stored and processed on this asset;
The level of investment in each information asset, in terms of developing, maintaining, or replacing the
asset, and
The information assets, for which the organization directly assigns value.

When these factors are assessed, the decision becomes easier. If the objectives of an asset are extremely
important to an organization's conduct of business, or if the assets are at high risk, then a second iteration, the
detailed risk assessment, should be conducted for the particular information asset (or part thereof).
A general rule to apply is: if the lack of information security can result in significant adverse consequences to
an organization, its business processes or its assets, then a second iteration risk assessment, at more
detailed level, is necessary to identify potential risks.

E.2 Detailed information security risk assessment
The detailed information security risk assessment process involves in-depth identification and valuation of
assets, the assessment of threats to those assets, and assessment of vulnerabilities. The results from these
activities are then used to assess the risks and then identify risk treatment.
The detailed step usually requires considerable time, effort and expertise, and may therefore be most suitable
for information systems at high risk.
The final stage of the detailed information security risk assessment is to assess the overall risks, which is the
focus of this annex.
Consequences may be assessed in several ways, including using quantitative, e.g. monetary, and qualitative
measures (which can be based on the use of adjectives such as moderate or severe), or a combination of
both. To assess the likelihood of threat occurrence, the time frame over which the asset will have value or
needs to be protected should be established. The likelihood of a specific threat occurring is affected by the
following:





The attractiveness of the asset, or possible impact applicable when a deliberate human threat is being
considered
The ease of conversion exploiting a vulnerability of the asset into reward, applicable if a deliberate human
threat is being considered
The technical capabilities of the threat agent, applicable to deliberate human threats, and
The susceptibility of the vulnerability to exploitation, applicable to both technical and non-technical
vulnerabilities

Many methods make use of tables, and combine subjective and empirical measures. It is important that the
organization uses a method with which the organization is comfortable, in which the organization has
confidence, and that will produce repeatable results. A few examples of table-based techniques are given
below.
For additional guidance on techniques that can be used for detailed information security risk assessment, see
IEC 31010.
The following examples use numbers to describe qualitative assessments. Users of these methods should be
aware that it might be invalid to perform further mathematical operations using the numbers that are
qualitative results produced by qualitative risk assessment methods.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

E.2.1 Example 1 Matrix with predefined values
In risk assessment methods of this type, actual or proposed physical assets are valued in terms of
replacement or reconstruction costs (i.e. quantitative measurements). These costs are then converted onto
the same qualitative scale as that used for information (see below). Actual or proposed software assets are
valued in the same way as physical assets, with purchase or reconstruction costs identified and then
converted to the same qualitative scale as that used for information. Additionally, if any application software is
found to have its own intrinsic requirements for confidentiality or integrity (for example if source code is itself
commercially sensitive), it is valued in the same way as for information.
The values for information are obtained by interviewing selected business management (the “data owners”)
who can speak authoritatively about the data, to determine the value and sensitivity of the data actually in use,
or to be stored, processed or accessed. The interviews facilitate assessment of the value and sensitivity of the
information in terms of the worst case scenarios that could be reasonably expected to happen from adverse
business consequences due to unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized modification, non-availability for varying
time periods, and destruction.
The valuation is accomplished using information valuation guidelines, which cover such issues as:











Personal safety
Personal information and privacy
Legal and regulatory obligations
Law enforcement
Commercial and economic interests
Financial loss/disruption of activities
Public order
Business policy and operations
Loss of goodwill
Contract or agreement with a customer

The guidelines facilitate identification of the values on a numeric scale, such as the 0 to 4 scale shown in the
example matrix below, thus enabling the recognition of quantitative values where possible and logical, and
qualitative values where quantitative values are not possible, e.g. for endangerment of human life.
The next major activity is the completion of pairs of questionnaires for each threat type, for each grouping of
assets that a threat type relates to, to enable the assessment of the levels of threats (likelihood of occurrence)
and levels of vulnerabilities (ease of exploitation by the threats to cause adverse consequences). Each
question answer attracts a score. These scores are accumulated through a knowledge base and compared
with ranges. This identifies threat levels on say a high to low scale and vulnerability levels similarly, as shown
in the example matrix below, differentiating between the types of consequences as relevant. Information to
complete the questionnaires should be gathered from interviews with appropriate technical, personnel and
accommodation people, and physical location inspections, and reviews of documentation.
The asset values, and the threat and vulnerability levels, relevant to each type of consequence, are matched
in a matrix such as that shown below, to identify for each combination the relevant measure of risk on a scale
of 0 to 8. The values are placed in the matrix in a structured manner. An example is given below:

Asset
Value

For each asset, the relevant vulnerabilities and their corresponding threats are considered. If there is a
vulnerability without a corresponding threat, or a threat without corresponding vulnerability, there is presently
no risk (but care should be taken in case this situation changes). Now the appropriate row in the matrix is
identified by the asset value, and the appropriate column is identified by the likelihood of the threat occurring
and the ease of exploitation. For example, if the asset has the value 3, the threat is “high” and the
vulnerability “low”, the measure of risk is 5. Assume an asset has a value of 2, e.g. for modification, the threat
level is “low” and the ease of exploitation is “high”, then the measure of risk is 4. The size of the matrix, in
terms of the number of threat likelihood categories, ease of exploitation categories and the number of asset
valuation categories, can be adjusted to the needs of the organization. Additional columns and rows will
necessitate additional risk measures. The value of this approach is in ranking the risks to be addressed.
A similar Matrix as shown in Table E.1 b) results from the consideration of the likelihood of an incident
scenario, mapped against the estimated business impact. The likelihood of an incident scenario is given by a
threat exploiting a vulnerability with a certain likelihood. The Table maps this likelihood against the business
impact related to the incident scenario. The resulting risk is measured on a scale of 0 to 8 that can be
evaluated against risk acceptance criteria. This risk scale could also be mapped to a simple overall risk rating,
for example as:
•
•
•

Low risk: 0-2
Medium Risk: 3-5
High Risk:6-8

A matrix or table such as that shown in Table E.2 can be used to relate the factors of consequences (asset
value) and likelihood of threat occurrence (taking account of vulnerability aspects). The first step is to evaluate
the consequences (asset value) on a predefined scale, e.g. 1 through 5, of each threatened asset (column “b”
in the table). The second step is to evaluate the likelihood of threat occurrence on a predefined scale, e.g. 1
through 5, of each threat (column “c” in the table). The third step is to calculate the measure of risk by
multiplying (b × c). Finally the threats can be ranked in order of their associated measure of risk. Note that in
this example, 1 is taken as the lowest consequence and the lowest likelihood of occurrence.

E.2.3 Example 3
risks

Assessing a value for the likelihood and the possible consequences of

In this example, the emphasis is placed on the consequences of information security incidents (i.e. incident
scenarios) and on determining which systems should be given priority. This is done by assessing two values
for each asset and risk, which in combination will determine the score for each asset. When all the asset
scores for the system are summed, a measure of risk to that system is determined.
First, a value is assigned to each asset. This value relates to the potential adverse consequences that can
arise if the asset is threatened. For each applicable threat to the asset, this asset value is assigned to the
asset.
Next a likelihood value is assessed. This is assessed from a combination of the likelihood of the threat
occurring and the ease of exploitation of the vulnerability, see Table E.3 expressing the likelihood of an
incident scenario.

Next, an asset/threat score is assigned by finding the intersection of asset value and likelihood value in
Table E.4. The asset/threat scores are totalled to produce an asset total score. This figure can be used to
differentiate between the assets forming part of a system.

Likelihood Value

The final step is to total all the asset total scores for the assets of the system, producing a system score. This
can be used to differentiate between systems and to determine which system's protection should be given
priority.
In the following examples all values are randomly chosen.
Suppose System S has three assets A1, A2 and A3. Also suppose there are two threats T1 and T2 applicable
to system S. Let the value of A1 be 3, similarly let the asset value of A2 be 2 and the asset value of A3 be 4.
If for A1 and T1 the threat likelihood is low and the ease of exploitation of the vulnerability is medium, then the
likelihood value is 1 (see Table E.3).
The asset/threat score A1/T1 can be derived from Table E.4 as the intersection of asset value 3 and likelihood
value 1, i.e. 4. Similarly, for A1/T2 let the threat likelihood is medium and the ease of exploitation of
vulnerability is high, giving an A1/T2 score of 6.
Now the total asset score A1T can be calculated, i.e. 10. The total asset score is calculated for each asset
and applicable threat. The total system score is calculated by adding A1T + A2T + A3T to give ST.
Now different systems can be compared to establish priorities and different assets within one system as well.
Above example shows in terms of information systems, however similar approach can be applied to business
processes.

Annex F
(informative)
Constraints for risk modification

While considering constraints for risk modification the following constraints should be taken into account:
Time constraints:
Many types of time constraints can exist. For example, controls should be implemented within a time period
acceptable for the organization’s managers. Another type of time constraint is whether a control can be
implemented within the lifetime of the information or system. A third type of time constraint may be the period
of time the organization’s managers decides is an acceptable period to be exposed to a particular risk.
Financial constraints:
Controls should not be more expensive to implement or to maintain than the value of risks they are designed
to protect, except where compliance is mandatory (e.g. with legislation). Every effort should be made not to
exceed assigned budgets and achieve financial advantage through the use of controls. However, in some
cases it may not be possible to achieve the desired security and level of risk acceptance due to budget
constraints. This therefore becomes an organization’s managers’ decision for resolution of this situation.
Great care should be taken if the budget reduces the number or quality of controls to be implemented since
this can lead to the implicit retention of greater risk than planned. The established budget for controls should
only be used as a limiting factor with considerable care.
Technical constraints:
Technical problems, like the compatibility of programmes or hardware, can easily be avoided if they are taken
into account during the selection of controls. In addition, the retrospective implementation of controls to an
existing process or system is often hindered by technical constraints. These difficulties may move the balance
of controls towards the procedural and physical aspects of security. It may be necessary to revise the
information security programme in order to achieve security objectives. This can occur when controls do not
meet the expected results in reducing risks without lessening productivity.
Operational constraints
Operational constraints such as the need to operate 24x7 yet still perform back-ups can result in complex and
costly implementation of controls unless they are built into the design right from the start.
Cultural constraints:
Cultural constraints to the selection of controls may be specific to a country, a sector, an organization or even
a department within an organization. Not all controls can be applied in all countries. For example, it may be
possible to implement bag searches in parts of Europe but not in parts of the Middle East. Cultural aspects
cannot be ignored because many controls rely on the active support of the staff. If the staff does not
understand the need for the control or do not find it culturally acceptable, the control will become ineffective
over time.
Ethical constraints:
Ethical constraints can have major implications on controls as ethics change based on social norms. This can
prevent implementing controls such as email scanning in some countries. Privacy of information can also
change dependent on the ethics of the region or government. These may be of more concern in some industry
sectors than others, for example, government and healthcare.

ISO/IEC 27005:2011(E)

Environmental constraints:
Environmental factors may influence the selection of controls, such as space availability, extreme climate
conditions, surrounding natural and urban geography. For example earthquake proofing may be required in
some countries but unnecessary in others.
Legal constraints:
Legal factors such as personal data protection or criminal code provisions for information processing could
affect the selection of controls. Legislative and regulatory compliance can mandate certain types of control
including data protection and financial audit; they can also prevent the use of some controls, e.g. encryption.
Other laws and regulations such as labour relations legislation, fire department, health and safety, and
economic sector regulations, etc., could affect control selection as well.
Ease of use:
A poor human-technology interface will result in human error and may render the control useless. Controls
should be selected to provide optimal ease of use while achieving an acceptable level of residual risk to the
business. Controls that are difficult to use will impact their effectiveness, as users may try to circumvent or
ignore them as much as possible. Complex access controls within an organization could encourage users to
find alternate, unauthorized methods of access.
Personnel constraints:
The availability and salary cost of specialized skill sets to implement controls, and the ability to move staff
between locations in adverse operating conditions, should be considered. Expertise may not be readily
available to implement planned controls or the expertise may be overly costly for the organization. Other
aspects such as the tendency of some staff to discriminate other staff members who are not security screened
can have major implications for security policies and practices. As well, the need to hire the right people for
the work, and finding the right people, may result in hiring before security screening is completed. The
requirement for security screening to be completed before hiring is the normal, and safest, practice.
Constraints of integrating new and existing controls:
Integration of new controls in the existing infrastructure and the interdependencies between controls are often
overlooked. New controls may not easily be implemented if there is incongruity or incompatibility with existing
controls. For example, a plan to use biometric tokens for physical access control may cause conflict with an
existing PIN-pad based system for access control. The cost of changing controls from existing controls to the
planned controls should include elements to be added to the overall costs of risk treatment. It may not be
possible to implement a selected control due to interference with current controls.

The English term “likelihood” does not have a direct equivalent in
some languages; instead, the equivalent of the term “probability” is often used.
However, in English, “probability” is often narrowly interpreted as a
mathematical term. Therefore, in risk management terminology, “likelihood” is
used with the intent that it should have the same broad interpretation as the
term “probability” has in many languages other than English.

NOTE 1
In risk management terminology, the word “likelihood” is used to
refer to the chance of something happening, whether defined, measured or
determined objectively or subjectively, qualitatively or quantitatively, and
described using general terms or mathematically (such as a probability or a
frequency over a given time period).

Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27010 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,

Introduction
This International Standard is a supplement to ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and ISO/IEC 27002:2005 for use by
information sharing communities. The guidelines contained within this International Standard are in addition to
and complement the generic guidance given within other members of the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards.
Whereas ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and ISO/IEC 27002:2005 address information exchange between
organizations, they do so in a generic manner. When organizations wish to communicate sensitive information
to multiple other organizations, the originator must have confidence that its use in those other organizations
will be subject to adequate security controls implemented by the receiving organizations. This can be
achieved through the establishment of an information sharing community, where each member trusts the
other members to protect the shared information, even though the organizations may otherwise be in
competition with each other.
An information sharing community cannot work without trust. Those providing information must be able to trust
the recipients not to disclose or to act upon the data inappropriately. Those receiving information must be able
to trust that information is accurate, subject to any qualifications notified by the originator. Both aspects are
important, and must be supported by demonstrably effective security policies and the use of good practice. To
achieve this, the community members must all implement a common management system covering the
security of the shared information. This is the ISMS for the information sharing community.
In addition, information sharing can take place between information sharing communities, where not all
recipients will be known to the originator. This will only work if there is adequate trust between the
communities and their information sharing agreements. It is particularly relevant to the sharing of sensitive
information between diverse communities such as different industry or market sectors.
This International Standard provides guidelines and general principles on how the specified requirements can
be met using established messaging and other technical methods. It is designed to support the creation of
trust when exchanging and sharing sensitive information, thereby encouraging the international growth of
information sharing communities.

4.1

Concepts and justification
Introduction

ISMS guidance specific to inter-sector and inter-organizational communications has been identified in
Clauses 5 to 15 below.
ISO/IEC 27002:2005 defines controls that cover the exchange of information between organizations on a
bilateral basis, and also controls for the general distribution of publicly available information. However, in
some circumstances there exists a need to share information within a community of organizations, where the
information is sensitive in some way and cannot be made publicly available other than to members of the
community. Often the information can only be made available to certain individuals within each member
organization, or may have other security requirements such as anonymisation of information. This
International Standard defines additional potential controls and provides additional guidance and interpretation
of ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and ISO/IEC 27002:2005 in order to meet these requirements.

4.2

Information sharing communities

To be effective, information sharing communities must have some common interest or other relationship to
define the scope of the shared sensitive information. For example, communities may be market sector specific,
and limit membership to organizations within that one sector. Of course, there may be other bases for
common interest, for example, geographical location, or common ownership.

4.3

Community management

Information sharing communities will be created from independent organizations or parts of organizations.
There may therefore not be clear or uniform organizational structures and management functions applying to
all members. For information security management to be effective, management commitment is necessary.
Therefore, the organizational structures and management functions applying to community information
security management should be clearly defined.
Differences among member organizations of an information sharing community should also be considered.
The differences could include:
 whether member organizations already operate their own ISMS, and
 member rules on protections of assets and information disclosure.

4.4

Supporting entities

Many information sharing communities will choose to establish or appoint a centralised supporting entity to
organize and support information sharing. Such an entity can provide many supporting controls such as
anonymisation of source and recipients more easily and efficiently than where members communicate directly.
There are a number of different organizational models that can be used to create supporting entities. Annex D
to this International Standard describe two common models, the Trusted Information Communication Entity
(TICE) and the Warning, Advice and Reporting Point (WARP).

4.5

Inter-sector communication

Many information sharing communities will be sector based, as this provides a natural scope of common
interest. However, there may well be information shared by such communities that would be of interest to
other information sharing communities established in other sectors. In such cases it may be possible to
establish information sharing communities of information sharing communities, again based on some common
interest, such as the nature of the shared information. We refer to this as inter-sector communication.

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

Inter-sector communication is greatly facilitated where supporting entities exist within each information sharing
community, as the necessary information exchange agreements and controls can then be established
between the supporting entities, rather than between all members of all communities. Some inter-sector
communities will require anonymisation of the source or recipient organizations; this also can be achieved by
use of supporting entities.

4.6

Conformity

Any information security management system (ISMS) created and operated in accordance with
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and using controls from ISO/IEC 27002:2005, this International Standard and other
sources can be assessed for conformity against ISO/IEC 27001:2005, without modification or addition to that
International Standard.
However, there are a number of places where ISO/IEC 27001:2005 will need to be interpreted when applied
to an information sharing community (or, for inter-sector communication, a community of communities).
The first area where interpretation is required is the definition of the organization concerned.
ISO/IEC 27001:2005 requires that an ISMS is established by an organization and operates within the context
of its overall business activities and the risks that it faces (ISO/IEC 27001:2005, 4.1). In this context, the
relevant organization is the information sharing community. However, the members of the information sharing
community will themselves be organizations – see Figure 1.

Figure 1 — Communities and organizations
Secondly, in many information sharing communities, not all persons within the member organizations will be
permitted access to the sensitive information shared between members. In this case, part of the member
organization will be within scope of the community ISMS and part will be outside. The part outside the
community scope will only have access to community information if it is marked for wider release – see
Figure 2.

Figure 2 — Member partially in scope
It is possible that members of the information sharing community may have their own information security
management systems, and in consequence some processes might fall within scope of both the community
and members’ management systems. In this case, there is at least a theoretical possibility that there might be
conflicting and incompatible requirements upon those processes. This would be a case where exclusion from
the scope of the member’s ISMS might be justified – see ISO/IEC 27001:2005, 4.2.1 a).
When defining its risk assessment approach (ISO/IEC 27001:2005, 4.2.1 c), the information sharing
community will need to recognise that the impact of risks may be different on different members of the
community. The community will therefore need to choose a risk assessment methodology that can handle
non-uniform impact, similarly for its risk assessment criteria.
Measuring the effectiveness of the selected controls (ISO/IEC 27001:2005, 4.2.3 c) will need the participation
of all members of the information sharing community. All members will need to provide regular feedback to
information providers and the community as a whole concerning the effectiveness of the controls in their own
environment.

4.7

Communications model

Communications of sensitive information as covered by this International Standard can take any form – written,
verbal or electronic – provided that the selected control requirements are met.
In the remainder of this International Standard, individual sensitive communications are described in terms of
the following participants:
 The source of an item of information is the person or organization that originates an item of information;
the source does not need to be a member of the community.
 The originator is the member of an information sharing community that initiates its distribution within the
community. The originator may distribute the information directly, or send it to a supporting entity for
distribution. The originator may but need not be the same as the source of the information; the originator
may conceal the identity of the source. Communities may provide facilities to enable a member to conceal
its own identity as the originator.
 A recipient is a receiver of information distributed within the community. Recipients need not be members
of the community if the information is identified as available for wider distribution. Communities may
provide facilities to enable recipients to conceal their identities from the originators of information.

Information provided by other members of an information sharing community is an asset, and should be
protected and disseminated in accordance with any rules set by the information sharing community or by the
originator.

7.2

Information classification

7.2.1

Classification guidelines

Control 7.2.1 from ISO/IEC 27002:2005 is augmented as follows:
Control
Information should be classified in terms of its value, legal requirements, sensitivity, credibility and criticality to
the organization.
Implementation guidance
As well as the criteria given in ISO/IEC 27002:2005, information should be classified in terms of its credibility.
This should be assessed in terms of the reputation of its source, technical content, and quality of description.
Likewise, sensitivity can depend on many aspects of information beyond a need for maintaining its
confidentiality, such as the impact of disclosure, urgency for distribution or potential to compromise the
anonymity of its source.
Care should be taken in interpreting classification markings assigned by other members of an information
sharing community.
EXAMPLE
One well-known Email client displays the message “Please treat this as Confidential” when displaying
emails where the sensitivity header field has been set to “company confidential” (RFC 4021 [2]). It is not clear in this case
if the originator intended “company confidential” (and the message has been sent in error) or intended “confidential to you,
the recipient”.

7.2.2

Information labelling and handling

No additional information specific to inter-sector or inter-organizational communications.

7.3

Information exchanges protection

A control objective additional to ISO/IEC 27002:2005, clause 7, asset management, is:
Objective: To ensure adequate protection of information exchanges within an information sharing
community.
Information exchanged between members of an information sharing community should be protected in a
consistent manner, even though the members are independent entities or parts of entities that may mark,
distribute and protect their own information in different ways.
Where anonymity is requested, any information identifying the source of the information exchange should
be removed. Likewise, it should be possible to receive shared information without revealing the recipient’s
identity.
Release of shared information outside the community should be controlled.
7.3.1

Information dissemination

Control
Information dissemination within the receiving member should be limited, based on pre-defined dissemination
markings defined by the community.
Implementation guidance
Information which has no assigned dissemination marking should be given a default dissemination defined by
the information sharing community. If in doubt, or where there is no generally accepted agreement on default
dissemination, information should be treated conservatively. If possible, the recipient should request the
originator to re-transmit with an explicit dissemination marking.
Dissemination restrictions may include limitations on use such as controlling electronic copy and paste,
preventing screen shots being taken, or preventing printing and export.
Other information
Different attributes or components of shared information may have different sensitivities. In particular,
knowledge of the existence of a message or other shared information may have a different sensitivity to its
contents.
Information rights management functionality is often used to enforce in-use limitations. If so, a clear user rights
policy or model is needed so that users understand what their system will allow them to do and where they will
be blocked.
7.3.2

Information disclaimers

Control
Each information exchange should begin with a disclaimer, listing any special requirements to follow by the
recipients in addition to the normal information markings.
Implementation guidance
A recipient should request clarification from the originator if the disclaimer is not fully understood, or cannot be
implemented.

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

7.3.3

Information credibility

Control
Each information exchange should indicate the originator’s degree of confidence in the transmitted
information’s credibility and accuracy.
Implementation guidance
Based on urgency, potential consequences and technical constraints, it may not be possible to validate all
information before transmission. Where limitations exist, these should be indicated as part of the message.
Indicating reservations on credibility of information is particularly important where the source is anonymous or
unknown. It is also important to indicate where the originator has been able to validate the information given
directly, and can vouch for its authenticity.
7.3.4

Information sensitivity reduction

Control
The originator of an information exchange should indicate if the sensitivity of the information supplied will
reduce after some external event, or the passage of time.
Implementation guidance
Even if the sensitivity of supplied information reduces with time, it may still need protection. Classification
guidelines (see 6.4.2) may need to include defaults for sensitivity reduction.
7.3.5

Anonymous source protection

Control
A community member should remove any source identification information in any communication it originates
or receives where anonymity is requested.
Implementation guidance
The originator of information is responsible for obtaining approval from the source (if different) before
communicating the information to other members of the information sharing community. The originator should
also ask the source if it can be identified as the original provider of the information.
It is important that the source protection process looks at message content as well as message origin,
because analysis of the content may reveal the identity of the source. Where possible, the originator of the
message should ask the source to review the anonymised information and the list of intended recipients
before it is distributed.
EXAMPLE
A message such as “our ATMs were disabled today by a new virus that was not detected by our firewall
but was detected by our policy server” could reveal the source if only one bank suffered public service disruption on the
day in question.

There are technical mechanisms that can be used to provide authenticity without compromising anonymity.
For example, shared cryptographic secrets could be used to confirm that a communication originated from a
member of the community without revealing the actual identity of the originator.

7.3.6

Anonymous recipient protection

Control
With the approval of the originator, members of a community should be able to receive communications
without revealing their own identities.
Implementation guidance
Anonymous receipt can be implemented by both technical means (e.g. cryptography) and procedural means
(e.g. routing through a supporting entity). Care must be taken to ensure anonymity does not breach legal
constraints or reduce the overall level of trust within the community.
Other information
Anonymous receipt is often necessary for effective inter-sector communications because sector communities
will wish to keep their membership details private.
7.3.7

Onwards release authority

Control
Unless it is marked for wider release, information should not be distributed beyond the information sharing
community without formal approval from the originator.
Implementation guidance
Each recipient should be responsible for obtaining any necessary authorisations for wider release from the
originator prior to onwards distribution.
In inter-sector communications, the originator cannot know who all the organizations that receive the
information will be. In such a case, a general or specific sector release approval will need to be granted.
Other information
The Traffic Light Protocol (see Annex C) is often used to indicate how information can be further distributed
without seeking additional approval.

10.8.4 Electronic messaging
Control 10.8.4 from ISO/IEC 27002:2005 is augmented as follows:
Implementation guidance
All information sharing communities should define rules for the protection of information in transit, and only
permit members to join the community if such rules are accepted and implemented by the prospective
member. Any supporting entity should implement such rules internally.

13 Information security incident management
13.1 Reporting information security events and weaknesses
13.1.1 Reporting information security events
Control 13.1.1 from ISO/IEC 27002:2005 is augmented as follows:
Implementation guidance
Members of an information sharing community should consider whether detected events should be reported to
other members of the community. The community should agree and publish guidance on the types of incident
that will be of interest to other members. Members should exercise judgement to ensure only events
potentially of interest to other members are reported.
There is a strong tendency for incidents to be kept confidential and for a community member not to disclose
incident information in order to protect the originator’s reputation. However, communicating incident
information to others will foster future cooperation and coordination in incident prevention, prompt rapid
reaction to incidents and will improve overall security within the community. Events and incidents can be
reported without necessarily revealing all their consequences.
Likewise, members should examine all reported events promptly to see if they will have an impact upon their
own operations. For example, a routine announcement by a member providing a shared service of a planned
maintenance operation might require other members to review the reliability of alternative providers before the
maintenance activity starts.
13.1.2 Reporting security weaknesses
No additional information specific to inter-sector or inter-organizational communications.
13.1.3 Early warning system
A control additional to ISO/IEC 27002:2005, 13.1, reporting information security events and weaknesses, is:
Control
An early warning system should be deployed within the information sharing community to effectively
communicate priority information as soon as it is available.
Implementation guidance
Priority information is information that may enable other community members to avoid or minimise similar
undesirable events. It is important that such information is shared urgently, even if it is not fully analysed or
confirmed.

Investigations based on information distributed by an information sharing community should be performed, to
reduce the risks of similar incidents and develop a better understanding of the risks facing the community and
any related significant information infrastructures. Such investigations could be performed by the community
members involved, or by a supporting entity, if one exists.
Following reported incidents, post incident reviews should be performed by members of the information
sharing community to trigger updates to security incident response plans, related procedures and the
business risk profile, even if the member was not affected by the incident in question. Each member should
ensure that reported incident responses are assessed, and any lessons or possible improvements to the
member’s own processes are identified and acted upon to continuously improve its own response processes.

Annex A
(informative)
Sharing sensitive information

A.1 Introduction
Sensitive information is an asset of important value that must be securely managed when shared between
organizations. It must be delivered in time to address business issues and to make better decisions, even
more so if it is critical to the organization.
Information sharing communities may represent many types of organization and even individual people.
Communities may be extraordinarily diverse in their membership, or be aligned very closely with a form of
business activity such as a particular industry or market sector. Communities may be located in both the
public and private sectors, or may contain members of both kinds. The requirement is a common wish to
share sensitive information of some type, and to accept agreed controls and processes governing the use of
that information.
To securely exchange sensitive information within an information-sharing community, it is necessary to design,
implement and monitor processes to provide a secured flow of information on a timely basis. The processes
should ensure that information is disseminated to the appropriate persons, whilst providing reasonable
assurance that the information cannot be used for malicious purposes and is not indiscriminately re-distributed
so as to become essentially public information.
The effectiveness of distribution will be determined by the degree of trust that members hold in the
relationships established by the information sharing community. At the same time, the security mechanisms
relating to communications should prevent distributing information to persons or organizations that would
likely:
 use or accumulate the data to perform malicious acts;
 publicly disseminate information without permission of the information originator;
 provide information that has not been sufficiently analysed and therefore induces inappropriate actions,
which could waste or mislead resources and the impact on organizations.
For information sharing communities to function effectively, recipients of information must be empowered by
their member organizations to act upon the information received, and must not be encouraged to misuse that
information, for example for commercial advantage.

A.2 Challenges
Adequate information security management for inter-sector and inter-organizational communications is
strongly recommended to face the following challenges; failure to do so could impact normal business
conditions and cause disruptions during incidents:
 New security threats and vulnerabilities.
 System and network increased dependencies.
 Contractual, legal, regulatory and business evolution and limits.
 Adequate communications models establishment.

17

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

 Attack and reaction processes coordination.
 Ongoing governance.
Secured and resilient communications between community members should include the following elements:
 Risk knowledge and management.
 Dissemination and communication.
 Monitoring.
While these three elements should be taken for their specific value, they are closely linked and complement
each other.
It is difficult to develop trust between members of an information sharing community without personal
relationships with the representatives of other members. People need to meet face to face, in order to build
relationships and create confidence in each other’s credibility and discretion. It is difficult to create trust using
only remote communications technologies. It is also difficult to establish mechanisms which give confidence in
the credibility of the source of information whilst retaining the anonymity of that source. People will often speak
more freely if they have confidence that their identity will be kept confidential.
An information sharing community can be effective even if not all members share all information with all other
members. Distribution mechanisms must be flexible enough to enable distribution to be limited to specific
members of the community, or to be limited by topic.
Finally, when sharing information between communities (for example, in inter-sector communications), the
gatekeepers between the communities face special difficulties. Sources of information will not necessarily
have knowledge of the membership of other communities and must rely on the interfaces to protect anonymity
and other conditions of release. The gatekeepers may lack the specialist knowledge to realise when certain
community communications should not be passed further. These problems are typically even worse in
international rather than inter-sector communications.

A.3 Potential benefits
Sharing sensitive information with others inevitably increases the potential risk of inappropriate disclosure. For
a community to be effective, these risks must be managed and minimised, and the benefits seen as
outweighing the accepted residual risks.
The potential benefits of sharing sensitive information include:
 Early warning of any significant change in the risk situation, like new threats, updated likelihood of attack,
newly discovered vulnerabilities, etc.
 Improved security through shared best practice.
 Access to useful information not available from any public source.
 Cost savings through elimination of duplicated effort.
 Better risk assessments through greater understanding of threats and vulnerabilities.
 Better organization of maintenance and intervention from information concerning similar activities at other
organizations.
 Better preparedness for security incidents.

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

 Benchmarking of security measures against similar organizations.
 Corporate social responsibility.
 Compliance with legal requirements or corporate policy.
It is essential that the community monitoring and review processes identify concrete benefits (and drawbacks)
from community membership for use by members in assessing their continued membership of the community.

A.4 Applicability
Information can be exchanged between many types of organization, large or small, government or private,
similar or diverse. However, the greatest benefits may often be experienced by organizations operating within
the same sector or with the same corporate objectives, which share sector-specific categories of information
security risk. ISO/IEC 27006 [3] identifies some such sectors.
There may also be great benefits in sharing information across sectors, either by defining communities based
upon other characteristics (such as geographical location) or by sharing information with other sector-based
information sharing communities in a hierarchical structure of communities.

A.5 Defining and operating an information sharing community
The information sharing community should define the rules and conditions governing its operation. Such rules
and conditions should include:
 The rules and conditions governing membership of the information sharing community and its internal
organization;
 The objectives of the information sharing community and intended benefits to members;
 The procedures for members joining or leaving the information sharing community;
 The rules and conditions governing any centralised community processes or entities such as a TICE or
WARP;
 The rules and conditions regarding obligations of community members, disciplinary and expulsion
processes and criteria;
 Clear rules for how members may use and pass on shared information;
 The other legal and financial obligations and conditions of community membership.
The rules and conditions of the information sharing community should also:
 ensure that information is communicated in an efficient and secure manner that ensures that its target
audience properly receives the data in good time;
 specify and prioritise potential and selected communication channels, in terms of priority usage to
communicate the data for each identified information type;
 specify the permitted circumstances under which information is transmitted to members of the community;
 specify the mandatory and optional data protection and distribution attributes associated with community
communications;

19

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

 specify clear rules for interpreting the data protection and distribution attributes concerning information
dissemination;
 require members to provide feedback on the relevance, timeliness and accuracy of the information
received;
 where possible, specify or adapt existing messaging standards for the exchange of information.
The communication rules shall define the frequency of communication, any requirements for confirmation of
receipt, and any priority or escalation criteria. The rules should recognise that members of the information
sharing community may have varying levels of trust in other members of the community. That degree of trust
may vary over time and situation.
Appropriate communication channels should be selected by assessing their strengths and weaknesses when
delivering the identified information types supported by the community, based on criteria such as target
audience, attributes of the information to be delivered, channel reach and frequency, and cost. Examples of
possible communication channels are electronic messaging, public or member-only sites, conference or twoway phone calls, letters sent by public postal services or face-to-face meetings. The influence a
communication has on its target audience depends on the effectiveness of the channel in reaching the
audience, its credibility with the audience and its appropriateness to the issue or the information subject.
Not all information needs to be communicated in real-time; some information can best be shared through
routine contact.
Possible examples of when information will be transmitted to members of the community are immediate
reporting of detected incidents fitting predefined profiles, routine reporting on a time basis, or responses to
requests for information from other members. Possible examples of data protection and distribution attributes
are a requirement to conceal the origin of the information, the sensitivity of the information or the originator’s
assessment of the trustworthiness of the information. An example of a set of rules for interpreting data
protection and distribution attributes is the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) – see Annex C. Attributes may vary
depending on the communications channel used. For example, the mandatory attributes for postal distribution
may well be different from those for Internet email.
Whatever technical solutions are selected and implemented, they should be appropriate for the types of
information shared within the community and consistent with the defined objectives of the community. Face to
face contact builds trust and may be a necessary way to grow communities by inviting new members.
However, the existence of a trusted platform or other sharing infrastructure may itself encourage membership.

A.6 Information exchange agreements
The information sharing community should define in an information exchange agreement the mechanisms and
processes governing community communications. Information can be exchanged by letter, or orally at face-toface meetings, as well as electronically. Information can be exchanged formally, using predefined formats and
protocols, or informally, in an unstructured way. Information could be exchanged on a routine or ad-hoc basis.
Information can be exchanged by peer-to-peer communications, hierarchically or through a centralised
supporting entity such as a TICE or WARP.
The information exchange agreement may permit information to be shared with only selected members of the
information sharing community, or only to be made shared anonymously. Likewise, even where centralised
reporting facilities exist, it may permit information to be passed between members directly.
The information exchange agreement should specify the types of information that may be exchanged between
members of the community, in order to ensure a common understanding by the community members of the
communicated information and to ensure that members design and implement appropriate security measures
for the sensitivity level of the shared information.

Examples of possible information types are:
 “Announcements”, which correspond to informative explained events;
 “Alerts and warnings”, which correspond to unexplained physical or IT-related events, denial of service
attacks, scanning or spoofing;
 “Incident handling”, which correspond to analysis, response support and response coordination relating to
actual incidents;
 “Information requests”, which correspond to requests for information from one member of the community
addressed to all or some other community members.
 “Quality of service predictions”, which provide information on the predicted effectiveness and reliability of
the various community communications channels.
Too much information sharing can be as bad as too little, unless a suitable method of filtering the data is
included. If building trend information is seen as a main benefit of sharing, there must be a method for
differentiating high priority “act now” information from low priority “for the record” information.

A.7 Success factors
Effective communities will have genuine shared interests, although not all members may be interested in all
aspects. For example, fixed line telecom companies will not be interested in wireless problems, but will
interested as interested as mobile companies in identifying hoax calls.
Members of effective communities will use empowered representatives that can make things happen internally.
Effective communities may limit or otherwise constrain membership, for example to ensure fair representation
in decision making.

A.8 Scope of the ISMS for an information sharing community
The scope of the ISMS for an information sharing community should include:
 all processes used for the communication of information between community members, including
intermediaries;
 the storage of information as relevant during the communication;
 the processes implemented by the relevant members to send and receive shared information;
 the processes implemented by community members for the destruction of shared information.
The scope should not include information security management processes implemented by the relevant
community members to manage their own information security, and possibly covered by other information
security management systems, apart from restrictions placed on the nature of the information to be shared
and the interfaces to the information sharing system. The ISMS could be managed centrally by a supporting
entity such as a TICE or WARP, or it could be managed collaboratively by the members of the community.

Annex B
(informative)
Establishing trust in information exchanges

B.1 Statement trust
A recipient’s degree of trust in a received statement is largely predicated on the degree to which the source of
the message is trusted, and the source’s own trust in the statement.
This is perhaps best encapsulated in the “5 By 5” model used within the law enforcement and intelligence
communities:
 {A – E} Decreasing degree of trust in source;
 {1 – 5} Decreasing degree of trust placed by source in information.
Thus “A-1” information is expected to be implicitly trusted, whereas “E-5” information will typically be discarded.
But, of course, in the real world there is very little “A-1” information. Perhaps the best known examples where
both the source and information are expected to be implicitly trusted, but for which occasional errors have to
be expected, is the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) based satellite navigation systems, where
instances of mapping or route planning system errors have been accidentally misleading, causing large
vehicles to be misdirected down small tracks, which are often the stuff of “light relief” items in the press.
A further issue with regard to trust in statements is the risk of specious reinforcement. There is an intrinsic
tendency – or underlying assumption – that multiple instances of the same information from seemingly
differing sources is confirmatory.
This, to some extent, is of course true, but such trust cannot be taken too literally, and, in particular, any
mathematical model of such trust should not assign linear weighting to additional instances.

B.2 Technological support
B.2.1 Introduction
There are a number of technologies that have recently been developed to support trust in electronically
supplied information generated by unknown or unfamiliar entities. Such technologies are closely associated
with the concept of “Web 2.0” [4]. Web 2.0 is not a set of technologies – rather it is a philosophy/concept that
relates to social media and incorporates ideas such as the use of the Web as a platform, harnessing collective.
Two facets of Web 2.0 are of particular relevance to this International Standard:
 Pseudo anonymity;
 Reputation systems, also called reputation engines.

B.2.2 Anonymity and pseudo-anonymity
Sources and recipients of information may wish to remain anonymous for a variety of reasons. The strength to
which anonymity is actually achievable depends on the knowledge of the context i.e. how well the entire

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

messaging system is understood. In large, decentralised systems the messaging system may not be fully
known to any participant, and in many cases the context of the message will change over time.
The concept of anonymity is tied to the concept of unlinkability, where items of interest are no more and no
less related after any observation than they are related from a-priori knowledge.
Relationship anonymity implies a degree of untraceability as to who communicates with whom: thus, it is not
possible to link a originator to the recipient or recipients.
Unobservability is being unable to observe when the originator sends and the recipient receives.
Relationship unobservability means it is not possible to observe the communication between the originator
and the recipient.
Pseudonymity involves the replacing of a person’s name and other identifying characteristics with a label, in
order to prevent identification of the data subject or at least to make such identification substantially difficult.
Being pseudonymous is the state of using a pseudonym as an identification label.
With respect to the degree of linkability, various types of pseudonyms may be possible:
a) Person pseudonym: A person pseudonym is a substitute for the holder’s name which is regarded as
representation for the holder’s civil identity. It may be used in all contexts, e.g., a number of an identity
card, the social security number, DNA, a nickname, the pseudonym of an actor, or a mobile phone
number.
b) Role pseudonym: The use of role pseudonyms is limited to specific roles, e.g., a customer pseudonym or
an Internet account used for many instantiations of the same role “Internet user”. The same role
pseudonym may be used with different communication partners.
c) Relationship pseudonym: For each communication partner, a different pseudonym is used. This means
that different communications partners cannot tell that they are communicating with the same user.
d) Role-relationship pseudonym: For each role and for each communication partner, a different rolerelationship pseudonym is used. This means that the communication partner does not necessarily know,
whether two pseudonyms used in different roles belong to the same holder. On the other hand, two
different communication partners who interact with a user in the same role, do not know from the
pseudonym alone whether it is the same user.
EXAMPLE
Suppose a source of information regularly uses the name “Wool” when communicating information not in
the public domain to Bernstein and “Touched” when communicating the same information to Woodward. Bernstein then
receives information about a new subject from “Deep Throat” and Woodward from “Watergate”. Bernstein and Woodward
do not know if “Deep Throat” and “Watergate” are the same person and also do not know if “Deep Throat” is the same
person as “Wool” or “Touched”, or both.

e) Transaction pseudonym: For each transaction, a transaction pseudonym unlinkable to any other
transaction pseudonyms and at least initially unlinkable to any other transaction pseudonyms is used, e.g.,
randomly generated transaction numbers for online-banking. Therefore, transaction pseudonyms can be
used to realise as strong anonymity as possible.
In general, anonymity of both role pseudonyms and relationship pseudonyms is stronger than anonymity of
person pseudonyms. The strength of anonymity increases with the application of role-relationship
pseudonyms, the use of which is restricted to both the same role and the same relationship.
Anonymity is stronger if less personal data of the pseudonym holder can be linked to the pseudonym.

B.2.3 Reputation engines
The concept of a reputation engine forms the basis of many social media and social networks on the Web.
Reputation engines are used to filter the most relevant information and they become more relevant as the
quantity and variety of information increase dramatically.
A reputation engine can be defined as a formalised set of policies and procedures that are used to compute a
reputation score for an individual based on their past activity. In the online world, a reputation engine is tied to
the idea of a digital footprint. Digital footprints are traces of someone’s activity in a digital environment.
Credit reports and other mechanisms have always provided a means to quantify reputation – but a
comparison of the Web mechanisms of reputation (such as Internet auction ratings) to traditional credit reports
is interesting. As we transact on the Web (buy, sell, borrow, repay) we create digital data. This data is
captured by others (like credit rating agencies) and although it belongs to us – it is ‘owned’ by the credit rating
agency (and indeed we may be charged for accessing it!)
There are more refined form of reputation engines such as the eBay reputation engine 1) . The eBay engine
differs from a credit score because it is transparent. Every feedback (including negative feedbacks) are fed
back to the person about whom the comment is made – thus giving an opportunity for appeal.
A reputation engine could be used to increase trust by incorporating insights from the wider community
sources through tasks like validating new information sources, validating content sources, real time alerts
such as Twitter search and Google alerts, reinforcing trust from unknown sources, complementing search by
external insights, bringing in new/external ideas to the trusted sharing domain, forecasting opportunities and
threats from external sources, etc. However, many current Web 2.0 technologies (like wikis) have limitations
for building trust since they do not have a robust trust model internally.

B.3 Assessing trustworthiness of information
The concepts underpinning trust are intrinsically of a subjective rather than objective nature, and as such are
not necessarily amenable to mechanistic representation. Nonetheless, a Pareto approach [5] can be taken to
the problem: a solution where the majority of the desired result can be achieved with a relatively small amount
of effort, although any attempt to perfect the model would require a disproportionate amount of effort.
Possible components of such an approach are:
a)

That originators of information should assign a degree of trust in information they publish. The usefulness
of this approach has been validated by the United Kingdom’s Centre for Protection of National
Infrastructure, where it is used to automatically profile and disseminate warning information to a variety of
information sharing communities.

b)

That all information be clearly identified with its source, ideally using a structured data format.

c)

Notwithstanding the concept of source identification, there should also be support for anonymous
reporting, as experience from the safety world indicates that provision for anonymity significantly
increases information sharing.

d)

That the concept of a Boundary Object be used to encapsulate the substance of any information
exchanged. Boundary Objects are structured assemblages of information that have a degree of mutual
recognition within a community of interest, and as such both enable communication across linguistic and
domain boundaries: the success of initiatives such as Mitre’s Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE)
notation is attributed in part to their de facto adoption as such Boundary Objects.

That both originator and recipient of a trusted information exchange should provide an assessment as to
whether, and how many times, the information is supportive of previously received content: although
there is some scope for automated parsing of information for this purpose, it has to be recognised that
automated parsing of messages for such purposes within the current state of the art is unreliable. To
minimise the risks of specious reinforcement, a diminishing return Cumulative Distribution Function will
need to be applied to the count of number of previous instances, which will therefore mean that the
weighted value of additional information decreases as the count increases.

f)

That the source or recipient assign a flag as to whether the information has been confirmed
independently, to guard against enshrining so-called urban legends as useful information. This enshrines
a further degree of critical scepticism about information received.

That recipients of information should assign a subjective rating of the source, based on the precepts of
the “5 By 5” model (see B.1).

Suitably weighted, such criteria can enable members of an information sharing community to quantify the trust
they can and should place in the information that they receive from other members of the community. This is
represented pictorially in Figure B.1 above.

Annex C
(informative)
The Traffic Light Protocol

This annex describes the Traffic Light Protocol, a mechanism widely used in information sharing communities
to indicate the permitted distribution of information. Although the basic concept is widely understood, there are
a number of slightly different variations in use. This description is taken from the Good Practice Guide for
Network Security Information Exchanges published by the European Network and Information Security
Agency (ENISA) [6]. The concept was originally developed by the UK’s Centre for the Protection of National
Infrastructure (CPNI).
The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) was created in order to encourage greater sharing of sensitive information
between organizations. The originator needs to signal how widely they want their information to be circulated
beyond the immediate recipient, if at all.
The TLP is based on the concept of the originator labelling information with one of four colours to indicate
what further dissemination, if any, can be undertaken by the recipient. The recipient must consult the
originator if wider dissemination is required.
The four colours and their meanings are as follows:
 RED - Personal for Named Recipients Only. In the context of a meeting, for example, RED information is
limited to those present at the meeting. In most circumstances, RED information will be passed verbally
or in person.
 AMBER - Limited Distribution. The recipient may share AMBER information with others within their
organization, but only on a ‘need-to-know’ basis. The originator may be expected to specify the intended
limits of that sharing.
 GREEN - Community Wide. Information in this category can be circulated widely within a particular
community. However, the information may not be published or posted on the Internet, nor released
outside of the community.
 WHITE – Unlimited. Subject to standard copyright rules, WHITE information may be distributed freely,
without restriction.
Sensitive information howsoever provided by an originator should be marked at the time of disclosure in
accordance with the TLP. All sensitive information will be deemed to be AMBER unless otherwise stated or
written. However, by default and unless specifically stated otherwise at the time of disclosure, the identity of
the source of the sensitive information will always be RED.
The TLP can also be adapted for use within an organization, for example where only some individuals are
granted full access to all shared information. See Figure 2.

Annex D
(informative)
Models for organizing an information sharing community

D.1 Introduction
There are many ways that an information sharing community can be organized, from a loose association of
peered partners to a highly structured and centrally controlled formal legal entity. This annex describes two
forms of community organization that may be found in practice and which support effective information
security management.

D.2 Trusted Information Communication Entities
D.2.1 Introduction
A Trusted Information Communication Entity (TICE) is an autonomous organization that supports information
exchange between members of an information sharing community by acting as a centralised coordination and
communications portal. It can become the core element of an effective information security management
system for inter-sector or inter-organizational communications. A TICE can ensure efficient and secured
information exchanges between members of the information sharing community and assist them in the
capabilities for effective monitoring, analysis and managing the responses to incidents and risks.
A Trusted Information Communication Entity (TICE) is composed of a team of subject matter experts whose
main businesses are to:
 ensure proper information exchanges between the TICE and community members;
 analyze and respond to information security incidents;
 handle incidents and support community members to recover from breaches;
 provide related information security awareness to community members by:


issuing advisories on vulnerabilities in the components in use,

 Informing the representatives of community members about exploits and viruses taking advantage of
these flaws, so the authenticated members could perform efficient components patch and update.
A TICE can act as a trusted intermediary to anonymise the source or recipients of shared information. This
enables members to have confidence that information comes from a trustworthy source, without necessarily
revealing their own identities or placing trust in other members whose identity is concealed.
A TICE may be based on, or developed from, an existing organization such as a Information Security Incident
Response Team (ISIRT), that already serves the relevant community. However, an ISIRT would need to be
expanded to provide proactive TICE services as well as the reactive services generally provided by a ISIRT.

D.2.2 TICE organizational considerations
D.2.2.1

Subject matter experts

The structure should consist of public or sector expertise to ensure that the right people with the appropriate
skills are involved, to ensure the experts could determine the relevance of any information within intercommunications and related information infrastructures context.
The experts should be used to conduct analysis, especially in the following domains (but not limited to):
 business management;
 IT security and infrastructure;
 operations;
 internal regulators;
 legal department.
The experts can either be part-time or full-time and may be located at a central site, operational sites, or a
combination of these.
D.2.2.2

Organizational structure

A typical TICE should include as a minimum the following functions:
 Executive Board (essential; those responsible for TICE strategic management and relations with
community members).
 Operational Technical team (essential; those responsible for analyzing business and technical risk issues
and determining appropriate applicability for applying patches or changes).
 Operational Technical correspondents (optional; those recommended to improve the TICE understanding
of the operational environment or the resources involved at the components aggregations level (local
site)).
 Legal experts (optional; but recommended especially during the starting phase of the TICE to mitigate
legal issues).
 Communication experts (optional; those recommended for focusing on translating difficulties related to
technical issues to prepare more understandable messages for members). The communication experts
could provide feedback from community members to the operational technical team, so acting as a
facilitator between these two groups.
D.2.2.3

Community member management

Support should be provided by the TICE to authenticate, evaluate, continually understand and manage the
community members or their representatives to ensure an adequate trusted relationship.
D.2.2.4

Organizational model

The suitable organizational model for a TICE depends highly on the current structures in place, the nature of
community members and the potential for the TICE to be expanded to fulfil the stated services. It also
depends on the accessibility of subject matter experts to be hired permanently or on an ad-hoc basis.

29

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

There are at least three possible models:
 Independent model: an independent TICE is acting as an independent organization, with its own
management and employees.
 Embedded model: an embedded TICE is established within an organization using its resources for
providing services. The number of allocated resources could vary to support the activities during normal
conditions and specific situations.
 Voluntary model. The voluntary TICE is composed by experts that provide advice and support to each
other on a voluntary basis. It should be considered as an experts community, highly dependent on the
motivation of participants.

D.2.3 TICE core and optional services
Selecting the services provided by the TICE to community members is a crucial phase and should be based
on the following elements:
 The scope and risks associated with the proposed communications between members of the information
sharing community;
 The TICE scope, organization and the nature of the information sharing community.
In addition, it highly depends on the role(s) to be assumed by the TICE within the community context (acting
as facilitator and / or initiator of information sharing between members).
Potential TICE core services are:
 Reactive services. Reactive services are designed to detect any potential attacks to the information
infrastructure components, analyze and report attacks and threats impacts, respond to requests for
assistance, reports of incidents to community members.
 Proactive services. Proactive services are designed to ensure and to facilitate adequate information
exchanges by improving security processes of the information sharing community and related information
infrastructures before any incident or event occurs or is detected. In addition, some proactive services are
designed to improve incidents prevention through awareness across the members to reduce their impact
and scope when they do occur.
Potential TICE optional services are:
 Malicious code investigation services. Malicious code investigation services are designed to:


Analyze any file or object found on a component that may be involved in malicious actions.



Handle and disseminate results to community members, vendors and other interested parties, in
order to prevent further spreading of malware and to mitigate the risks.

 Security and quality management services. Security and quality management services are designed to
assist community members in risk analysis, business continuity management and security awareness
with longer term goals.
 Anonymisation services. Anonymisation services are designed to enable community members to send or
receive information without revealing their own identity to other members.

D.2.4 Conclusion
The TICE model provides a comprehensive, controlled and structured model for information sharing between
organizations. It is particularly suited to critical environments where prompt and prioritised information sharing
and analysis is important and members or Government can support the cost of the central infrastructure
required.

D.3 Warning, Advice and Reporting Points
D.3.1 Introduction
The Warning, Advice and Reporting Point (WARP) model [7] has been in use since 2003 and provides a
proven mechanism for sharing of sensitive information between organizations in both the public and private
sectors.
A Warning, Advice and Reporting Point shares information between people or organizations with similar
interests, typically on a voluntary basis. The WARP is based on personal relationships between people
representing the members of the information sharing community. A typical WARP consists of an operator who
knows a little bit about the subject of interest, but is mainly chosen for being good at communicating with
members. There are usually between 20 and 100 members, otherwise the WARP may lose the personal
touch, and the members belong to a community of strong shared interest (small businesses, local government,
service providers, interest groups etc.).
WARP members agree to work together as part of a community and share information to reduce the risk of
their information systems being compromised, and therefore reduce the risk to their organization. This sharing
community could be based on a industry or market sector, geographic location, technology standards, interest
group, risk grouping, or whatever other shared interest makes business sense.
Typically, WARPs are small, personal and ‘Not-for-Profit’.

D.3.2 WARP functions
The WARP operator uses a website, email, telephone, SMS, and occasional meetings (where possible) to
send a personalised service of warnings and advice to the members. This is often IT security advice (because
there’s so much of it, and it changes so rapidly), but can include other material (other threats, e-crime,
contingency planning etc) as well. The operator also taps into the knowledge of the members themselves to
help out other members using a bulletin board, meetings and general communication skills. A successful
WARP builds up enough trust to encourage members to talk about their own incidents & problems,
anonymously, for the benefit of the rest (a bit like a ‘Neighbourhood Watch’ scheme).

D.3.3 WARP services
D.3.3.1

Overview

A WARP normally provides three core services:
 A filtered warning service - where members receive only the security information they need, selected via
an on-line tick-list;
 An advice brokering service - where members can learn from other members’ initiatives and experience,
possibly through a members’ bulletin board;
 A trusted sharing service - where reports are anonymised so that members can learn from each other’s
attacks and incidents, without fear of embarrassment or recrimination.

ISO/IEC 27010:2012(E)

D.3.3.2

Filtered warnings

The Filtered Warnings Service allows WARP members to receive warnings and advisories that are filtered
based upon their area of interest. The Filtered Warnings Application software uses a subscription tree ‘tick list’
which allows WARP members to easily modify and maintain their selections. The software also helps WARP
operators to easily categorise and distribute warnings and advisories in a timely manner. This service delivers
the Warning part of the Warning, Advice and Reporting Point.
D.3.3.3

Advice brokering

This service allows WARP community members to discuss good practice and information security issues in a
secure environment. The service also enables members to offer their experience and skills to others, possibly
on a barter basis, where one has done work in an area that another is contemplating. This service delivers the
Advice part of the Warning, Advice and Reporting Point.
D.3.3.4

Trusted sharing

This service provides a trusted environment in which WARP members can share sensitive information, such
as incident or threat data, in the knowledge that it will not cause them harm or embarrassment. Reporting can
be achieved via the telephone, email or face-to-face, with appropriate security safeguards. Once sanitised,
and anonymised if appropriate, such incident information may also be passed to other WARPs with whom a
trusted relationship exists, and to Government, for collating and monitoring national trends. This service
delivers the Reporting part of the Warning, Advice and Reporting Point.
D.3.3.5

Other services

WARPs may provide other services that are of benefit to their community members. However, such services
are normally kept very simple and straightforward, in order to minimise the time and resources required from
the WARP operator to support them.

D.3.4 Benefits
WARPs deliver effective and low cost information security to members by providing:
 A trusted environment;
 Security information filtering;
 Access to expert advice;
 Early warning of threats;
 Strategic decision support;
 Improved security awareness.
Some of the many potential benefits associated with the establishment of a WARP are:
 Work efficiency: WARPs promote the sharing of information and the coordination of common tasks, which
in turn, will reduce duplication of work. This will benefit a corporate or government provider through
increased efficiency.
 Avoidance of reputation damage: as organizations move to a more online approach to interact with the
public, web presence becomes a key factor. If a website is unavailable or has been defaced, this can
cause reputation issues and could discourage the uptake of web services. The community served will be
better protected by being WARP members.

 Early warning: Finding out about problems and solutions others are experiencing, and sharing these
within the WARP community will facilitate a unique and personalised service, which even a large
commercial provider could not match.
 Support from Government and other WARPs: The advantage of belonging to such a focused community
means the ability to share and distribute helpful advice from a trusted source. Operational support from
other WARPs is well established through the WARP Operators Forum. There is also peer-to-peer
cooperation through the Filtered Warnings Application which enables distribution of other WARPs'
warnings and advisories easily.
 Low cost: The model is designed to be very low cost, through minimal staffing levels (or virtual teams).
 Comprehensive free Toolbox: A WARP provider has access to the WARP Toolbox, which has been
created from the experience of existing WARPs. It includes background information, how to get started,
how to build and run a WARP, and an extensive list of downloads, from press articles to marketing
materials.
 Sustainability: WARPs are now becoming widely established, with many respected organizations
successfully adopting the approach with proven sustainability.
 Software: WARP providers may have access to specialist software developed to support all three WARP
services.
 Increased credibility: The ‘Not-for-Profit’ ethos, and the association with existing best practice, will help
gain the community’s trust and can aid an organization’s credibility, especially in the context of ‘Public
Good’ activities.
 Compliance: WARP membership will help member organizations satisfy the organizational contact
controls identified within ISO/IEC 27002:2005.
 Growth potential: Many existing WARP providers are in the process of establishing further WARPs,
building on the existing infrastructure and expertise which both supports lower costs and better
sustainability. WARPs are now appearing across many sectors, and are beginning to spread
internationally.
 Corporate Social Responsibility: Being a WARP member enhances the member organization’s corporate
social responsibility thereby gaining the community’s trust and potentially supporting both the operator’s
and the members’ other business strategies.

D.3.5 Conclusion
The WARP model provides a simple, collaborative model for information sharing between like-minded
organizations. It is particularly suited to situations where funding is limited and the central infrastructure must
be provided and run on a voluntary basis.

Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission)
form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC
participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees established by the
respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC technical committees
collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental and non-governmental,
in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have
established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27032 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.

Introduction
The Cyberspace is a complex environment resulting from the interaction of people, software and services on
the Internet, supported by worldwide distributed physical information and communications technology (ICT)
devices and connected networks. However there are security issues that are not covered by current information
security, Internet security, network security and ICT security best practices as there are gaps between these
domains, as well as a lack of communication between organizations and providers in the Cyberspace. This is
because the devices and connected networks that have supported the Cyberspace have multiple owners, each
with their own business, operational and regulatory concerns. The different focus placed by each organization
and provider in the Cyberspace on relevant security domains where little or no input is taken from another
organization or provider has resulted in a fragmented state of security for the Cyberspace.
As such, the first area of focus of this International Standard is to address Cyberspace security or Cybersecurity
issues which concentrate on bridging the gaps between the different security domains in the Cyberspace. In particular
this International Standard provides technical guidance for addressing common Cybersecurity risks, including:
—

social engineering attacks;

—

hacking;

—

the proliferation of malicious software (“malware”);

—

spyware; and

—

other potentially unwanted software.

The technical guidance provides controls for addressing these risks, including controls for:
—

preparing for attacks by, for example, malware, individual miscreants, or criminal organizations on the Internet;

—

detecting and monitoring attacks; and

—

responding to attacks.

The second area of focus of this International Standard is collaboration, as there is a need for efficient and
effective information sharing, coordination and incident handling amongst stakeholders in the Cyberspace.
This collaboration must be in a secure and reliable manner that also protects the privacy of the individuals
concerned. Many of these stakeholders can reside in different geographical locations and time zones, and are
likely to be governed by different regulatory requirements. Stakeholders include:
—

consumers, which can be various types of organizations or individuals; and

—

providers, which include service providers.

Thus, this International Standard also provides a framework for
—

information sharing,

—

coordination, and

—

incident handling.

The framework includes
—

key elements of considerations for establishing trust,

—

necessary processes for collaboration and information exchange and sharing, as well as

—

technical requirements for systems integration and interoperability between different stakeholders.

Given the scope of this International Standard, the controls provided are necessarily at a high level. Detailed
technical specification standards and guidelines applicable to each area are referenced within this International
Standard for further guidance. Licensed to Mr. PEDDINTI

INTERNATIONAL STANDARD

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

Information technology — Security techniques — Guidelines for
cybersecurity
1 Scope
This International Standard provides guidance for improving the state of Cybersecurity, drawing out the unique
aspects of that activity and its dependencies on other security domains, in particular:
—

information security,

—

network security,

—

internet security, and

—

critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP).

It covers the baseline security practices for stakeholders in the Cyberspace. This International Standard provides:
—

an overview of Cybersecurity,

—

an explanation of the relationship between Cybersecurity and other types of security,

—

a definition of stakeholders and a description of their roles in Cybersecurity,

—

guidance for addressing common Cybersecurity issues, and

—

a framework to enable stakeholders to collaborate on resolving Cybersecurity issues.

2 Applicability
2.1

Audience

This International Standard is applicable to providers of services in the Cyberspace. The audience, however,
includes the consumers that use these services. Where organizations provide services in the Cyberspace to people
for use at home or other organizations, they may need to prepare guidance based on this International Standard that
contains additional explanations or examples sufficient to allow the reader to understand and act on it.

2.2

Limitations

This International Standard does not address:
—

Cybersafety,

—

Cybercrime,

—

CIIP,

—

Internet safety, and

—

Internet related crime.

It is recognized that relationships exist between the domains mentioned and Cybersecurity. It is, however,
beyond the scope of this International Standard to address these relationships, and the sharing of controls
between these domains.
It is important to note that the concept of Cybercrime, although mentioned, is not addressed. This International
Licensed
to Mr.
Standard does not provide
guidance
onPEDDINTI
law-related aspects of the Cyberspace, or the regulation of Cybersecurity.

6 Overview
6.1

Introduction

Security on the Internet and in the Cyberspace has been a subject of growing concern. Stakeholders have been
establishing their presence in the Cyberspace through websites and are now attempting to further leverage the
virtual world provided by the Cyberspace.
EXAMPLE

Increasing numbers of individuals spend increasing amounts of time with their virtual avatars on MMORPGs.

While some individuals are careful in managing their online identity, most people are uploading details of their
personal profiles to share with others. Profiles on many sites, in particular social networking sites and chat
rooms, can be downloaded and stored by other parties. This can lead to the creation of a digital dossier of
personal data that can be misused, disclosed to other parties, or used for secondary data collection. While
the accuracy and integrity of this data are questionable, they create links to individuals and organizations that
often cannot be completely erased. These developments in the communication, entertainment, transportation,
shopping, financial, insurance, and healthcare domains create new risks to stakeholders in the Cyberspace.
Thus, risks can be associated with loss of privacy.
The convergence of information and communication technologies, the ease of getting into the Cyberspace,
and the narrowing of personal space between individuals are gaining the attention of individual miscreants and
criminal organizations. These entities are using existing mechanisms, such as phishing, spam and spyware, as
well as developing newer attack techniques, to exploit any weaknesses they can discover in the Cyberspace.
In recent years, security attacks in the Cyberspace have evolved from hacking for personal fame to organized
crime, or Cybercrime. A plethora of tools and processes previously observed in isolated Cybersecurity
incidents are now being used together in multi-blended attacks, often with far reaching malicious objectives.
These objectives range from personal attacks, identity theft, financial frauds or thefts, to political hactivism.
Specialist forums to highlight potential security issues have also served to showcase attack techniques and
criminal opportunities.
The multiple modes of business transactions that are carried out in the Cyberspace are becoming the target
of Cybercrime syndicates. Ranging from business-to-business, business-to-consumer to consumer-toconsumer services, the risks posed are inherently complex. Concepts such as what constitute a transaction or
an agreement are dependent on the interpretation of the law and how each party in the relationship manages
their liability. Often, the issue of usage of data collected during the transaction or relationship is not addressed
adequately. This can eventually lead to security concerns such as the leakage of information.
The legal and technical challenges posed by these Cybersecurity issues are far-reaching and global in nature.
The challenges can only be addressed by having the information security technical community, legal community,
nations and community of nations coming together through a coherent strategy. This strategy should take into
account the role of each stakeholder and existing initiatives, within a framework of international cooperation.
EXAMPLE
An example of a challenge sprouts from the fact that the Cyberspace affords virtual anonymity and stealth
of attack, making detection difficult. This makes it increasingly difficult for individuals and organizations to establish trust
and transact, as well as for law enforcement agencies to enforce related policies. Even if the source of attack can be
determined, cross-border legal issues often prevent further progress for any investigation or legal repatriation.

Current progress to address these challenges has been hampered by many issues, and Cybersecurity issues
are increasing and continuing to evolve.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

While there is no lack of Cybersecurity threats, and as many, albeit not standardized, ways to counter them, the
focus of this International Standard is on the following key issues:
—

attacks by malicious and potentially unwanted software;

—

social engineering attacks; and

—

information sharing and coordination.

In addition, some Cybersecurity tools will be discussed briefly in this International Standard. These tools and
areas closely relate to Cybercrime prevention, detection, response, and investigation. Further details can be
found in Annex A.

6.2

The nature of the Cyberspace

The Cyberspace can be described as a virtual environment, which does not exist in any physical form, but rather,
a complex environment or space resulting from the emergence of the Internet, plus the people, organizations,
and activities on all sort of technology devices and networks that are connected to it. Cyberspace security, or
Cybersecurity, is about the security of this virtual world.
Many virtual worlds have a virtual currency, such as used to purchase in-game items. There is an associated
real world value to the virtual currency and even in-game items. These virtual items are frequently traded for real
currency on online auction sites and some games even have an official channel with published virtual or real
currency exchange rates for the monetization of virtual items. It is often these monetization channels which make
these virtual worlds a target for attack, usually by phishing or other techniques for stealing account information.

6.3

The nature of Cybersecurity

Stakeholders in the Cyberspace have to play an active role, beyond protecting their own assets, in order for
the usefulness of the Cyberspace to prevail. The applications within the Cyberspace are expanding beyond the
business-to-consumers, and consumers-to-consumers models, to a form of many-to-many interactions and
transactions. The requirements are expanding for individuals and organizations to be prepared to address the
emerging security risks and challenges to effectively prevent and respond to misuse and criminal exploitations.
Cybersecurity relates to actions that stakeholders should be taking to establish and maintain security in
the Cyberspace.
Cybersecurity relies on information security, application security, network security, and Internet security as
fundamental building blocks. Cybersecurity is one of the activities necessary for CIIP, and, at the same time,
adequate protection of critical infrastructure services contributes to the basic security needs (i.e., security,
reliability and availability of critical infrastructure) for achieving the goals of Cybersecurity.
Cybersecurity is, however, not synonymous with Internet security, network security, application security,
information security, or CIIP. It has a unique scope requiring stakeholders to play an active role in order to
maintain, if not improve the usefulness and trustworthiness of the Cyberspace. This International Standard
differentiates Cybersecurity and the other domains of security as follows:
—

Information security is concerned with the protection of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information in general, to serve the needs of the applicable information user.

—

Application security is a process performed to apply controls and measurements to an organization’s
applications in order to manage the risk of using them. Controls and measurements may be applied to the
application itself (its processes, components, software and results), to its data (configuration data, user
data, organization data), and to all technology, processes and actors involved in the application’s life cycle.

—

Network security is concerned with the design, implementation, and operation of networks for achieving the
purposes of information security on networks within organizations, between organizations, and between
organizations and users.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

—

Internet security is concerned with protecting Internet-related services and related ICT systems and
networks as an extension of network security in organizations and at home, to achieve the purpose of
security. Internet security also ensures the availability and reliability of Internet services.

—

CIIP is concerned with protecting the systems that are provided or operated by critical infrastructure
providers, such as energy, telecommunication, and water departments. CIIP ensures that those systems
and networks are protected and resilient against information security risks, network security risks, Internet
security risks, as well as Cybersecurity risks.

Figure 1 summarizes the relationship between Cybersecurity and other security domains. The relationship
between these security domains and Cybersecurity is complex. Some of the critical infrastructure services, for
example water and transportation, need not impact the state of Cybersecurity directly or significantly. However,
the lack of Cybersecurity can have a negative impact on the availability of critical information infrastructure
systems provided by the critical infrastructure providers.

Figure 1 — Relationship between Cybersecurity and other security domains
On the other hand, the availability and reliability of the Cyberspace in many ways rely on the availability and
reliability of related critical infrastructure services, such as the telecommunications network infrastructure. The
security of the Cyberspace is also closely related to the security of the Internet, enterprise/home networks
and information security in general. It should be noted that the security domains identified in this section have
their own objectives and scope of focus. To deal with Cybersecurity issues, therefore requires substantial
communications and coordination between different private and public entities from different countries
and organizations. Critical infrastructure services are regarded by some governments as national security
related services, and therefore may not be discussed or disclosed openly. Furthermore, knowledge of critical
infrastructure weaknesses, if not used appropriately, can have a direct implication on national security. A basic
framework for information sharing and issue or incident coordination is therefore necessary to bridge the gaps
and provide adequate assurance to the stakeholders in the Cyberspace.

General model
Introduction

This clause presents a general model used throughout this International Standard. This clause assumes some
knowledge of security and does not propose to act as a tutorial in this area.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

This International Standard discusses security using a set of security concepts and terminology. An
understanding of these concepts and the terminology is a prerequisite to the effective use of this International
Standard. However, the concepts themselves are quite general and are not intended to restrict the class of IT
security problems to which this International Standard is applicable.
6.4.2

General security context

Security is concerned with the protection of assets from threats, where threats are categorised as the potential
for abuse of protected assets. All categories of threats should be considered; but in the domain of security
greater attention is given to those threats that are related to malicious or other human activities. Figure 2
illustrates these high level concepts and relationships.

Safeguarding assets of interest is the responsibility of stakeholders who place value on those assets. Actual or
presumed threat agents may also place value on the assets and seek to abuse assets in a manner contrary to the
interests of the applicable stakeholders. Stakeholders will perceive such threats as potential for impairment of
the assets such that the value of the assets to the stakeholders would be reduced. Security specific impairment
commonly includes, but is not limited to, damaging disclosure of the asset to unauthorised recipients (loss
of confidentiality), damage to the asset through unauthorised modification (loss of integrity), or unauthorised
deprivation of access to the asset (loss of availability).

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

Stakeholders assess risks taking into account threats that apply to their assets. This analysis can aid in the
selection of controls to counter the risks and reduce it to an acceptable level.
Controls are imposed to reduce vulnerabilities or impacts, and to meet security requirements of the stakeholders
(either directly or indirectly by providing direction to other parties). Residual vulnerabilities may remain after the
imposition of controls. Such vulnerabilities may be exploited by threat agents representing a residual level of
risk to the assets. Stakeholders will seek to minimise that risk given other constraints.
Stakeholders will need to be confident that the controls are adequate to counter the threats to assets before
they will allow exposure of assets to the specified threats. Stakeholders may not themselves possess the
capability to judge all aspects of the controls, and may therefore seek evaluation of the controls using external
organizations.

6.5

Approach

An effective way to confront Cybersecurity risks involves a combination of multiple strategies, taking into
consideration the various stakeholders. These strategies include:
—

industry best practices, with collaboration of all stakeholders to identify and address Cybersecurity
issues and risks;

—

broad consumer and employee education, providing a trusted resource for how to identify and address
specific Cybersecurity risks within the organization as well as in the Cyberspace; and

—

innovative technology solutions to help protect consumers from known Cybersecurity attacks, to stay
current and be prepared against new exploitations.

This guideline focuses on providing industry best practices and broad consumer and employee education to
assist stakeholders in the Cyberspace in playing an active role to address the Cybersecurity challenges. It
includes guidance for:
—

roles;

—

policies;

—

methods;

—

processes; and

—

applicable technical controls.

Figure 3 provides an overview of the salient points in the approach taken in this International Standard. This
International Standard is not intended to be directly used to provide broad consumer education. Instead, it is
intended to be used by providers of services in the Cyberspace, as well as organizations providing Cyberspace
related education to consumers, to prepare materials for broad consumer education.

7 Stakeholders in the Cyberspace
7.1

Overview

The Cyberspace belongs to no one; everyone can participate and has a stake in it.
For the purpose of this International Standard, stakeholders in the Cyberspace are categorized in the
following groups:
—

—

7.2

consumers, including
—

individuals; and

—

both private and public organizations;

providers, including but not limited to
—

Internet service providers; and

—

Application service providers.

Consumers

As described in Figure 3, consumers refer to individual users as well as private and public organizations.
Private organizations include small and medium enterprises (SMEs), as well as large enterprises. Government
and other public agencies are collectively referred to as public organizations. An individual or an organization
becomes a consumer when they access the Cyberspace or any services available in the Cyberspace.
A consumer can also be a provider if it in turn provides a service in the Cyberspace or enables another
consumer to access the Cyberspace. A consumer of a virtual world service may become a provider by making
available virtual products and services to other consumers.

7.3

Providers

Providers refer to providers of services in the Cyberspace, as well as Internet service providers that enable
consumers to access the Cyberspace and the various services available in the Cyberspace.
Providers might also be understood as carriers or wholesalers, versus distributors and retailers of access
services. This distinction is important from a security and, especially, law enforcement perspective, because, in
the event that a distributor or retailer is unable to provide adequate security or lawful access, support services
will often default back to the carrier or wholesaler. Understanding the nature of a given service provider is a
useful element in Cyberspace risk management.
Application service providers make services available to consumers through their software. These services
take many forms and include combinations of the following non-exhaustive list:
—

document editing, storage, distribution;

—

online virtual environments for entertainment, communications and interaction with other users;

—

online digital media repositories with aggregation, indexing, search, store-front, catalogue, shopping cart
and payment services; and

—

enterprise resource management functions such as human resource, finance and payroll, supply chain
management, customer relationship, invoicing.

8 Assets in the Cyberspace
8.1

Overview

An asset is anything that has value to an individual or an organization. There are many types of assets,
including but not limited to:
a)

information;

b)

software, such as a computer program;

c)

physical, such as a computer;

d)

services;

e)

people, their qualifications, skills, and experience; and

f)

intangibles, such as reputation and image.

NOTE 1

Often, assets are simplistically seen only as information or resources.

NOTE 2
ISO/IEC 15408-1:2005 defines an asset as information or resources to be protected by controls of a TOE
(target of evaluation).
NOTE 3
ISO/IEC 19770-1 has been developed to enable an organization to prove that it is performing Software Asset
Management (SAM) to a standard sufficient to satisfy corporate governance requirements and ensure effective support
for IT service management overall. ISO/IEC 19770 is intended to align closely to, and to support, ISO/IEC 20000.
NOTE 4
ISO/IEC 20000-1 promotes the adoption of an integrated process approach when establishing, implementing,
operating, monitoring, measuring, reviewing and improving a Service Management System (SMS) to design and deliver
services which meet business needs and customer requirements.

For the purpose of this International Standard, assets in the Cyberspace are classified into the following classes:
—

personal; and

—

organizational.

For both classes, an asset can also be further classified as
—

a physical asset, whose form exists in the real world, or

—

a virtual asset, which only exists in the Cyberspace and cannot be seen or touched in the real world.

8.2

Personal assets

One of the key virtual assets is an individual consumer’s online identity and his online credit information. Online
identity is considered an asset, since it is the key identifier for any individual consumer in the Cyberspace.
Other individual consumer virtual assets include references in virtual worlds. In virtual worlds, members often use
virtual avatars to represent or identify themselves, or to act on their behalf. Often a virtual currency is used for virtual
transactions. These avatars and currencies can be considered as assets belonging to an individual consumer.
EXAMPLE

Some banks operate in virtual worlds and recognize the virtual world’s money as an official currency.

IT hardware and software, as well as personal digital devices or endpoints that allow a consumer to connect to
and communicate in the Cyberspace, are also considered as assets in the context of this International Standard.

8.3

Organizational assets

A key aspect of the Cyberspace is the infrastructure that makes it all possible. This infrastructure is a meshed
interconnection of networks, servers and applications which belongs to many service providers. However, the
reliability and availability of
this infrastructure
is crucial in ensuring that the Cyberspace services and applications

﻿

15

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

are available to anyone in the Cyberspace. While any infrastructure that allow any consumer to connect to the
Cyberspace, or allow any consumer to access services in the Cyberspace, is considered a physical asset
that must be addressed in this International Standard, there may be overlaps with security measures that are
proposed in, for example, CIIP, Internet security and network security. However, this International Standard
shall focus on ensuring that security issues that may affect these organizational assets are appropriately
addressed without overly emphasizing other issues that are not within the scope of this International Standard.
Besides physical assets, virtual organizational assets are increasingly becoming more valuable. The online
brand and other representations of the organization in the Cyberspace uniquely identify the organization in the
Cyberspace and are as important as the brick and mortar of that organization.
EXAMPLE 1

An organization’s URL and website information are assets.

EXAMPLE 2

Countries have even set up embassies in a major virtual world to protect the representation of the country.

Other organizational assets which are exposed through vulnerabilities in the Cyberspace include intellectual
property (formulas, proprietary processes, patents, research results) and business plans and strategies
(product launch and marketing tactics, competitive information, financial information and reporting data).

9 Threats against the security of the Cyberspace
9.1

Threats

9.1.1

Overview

The threats that exist in the Cyberspace are discussed in relation to assets in the Cyberspace.
Threats to the Cyberspace can be divided into two key areas:
—

threats to personal assets:

—

threats to organizational assets;

9.1.2

Threats to personal assets

Threats to personal assets revolve mainly around identity issues, posed by the leakage or theft of personal information.
EXAMPLE 1

Credit information can be sold on the black market, which can facilitate online identity theft.

If a person’s online identity is stolen or masqueraded, that person can be deprived of access to key services and
applications. In more serious scenarios, the consequences can range from financial to national level incidents.
Unauthorized access to a person’s financial information also opens up the possibility of theft of the person’s
money and fraud.
Another threat is the possibility of the endpoint being made a zombie or bot. Personal computing devices can
become compromised and so become part of a larger botnet.
Besides the above, other virtual assets that are being targeted are personal assets in virtual worlds and online
games. Assets in a virtual world or the world of online games are subject to attack and exploitation as well.
EXAMPLE 2
Avatar details and virtual currency which can, in some cases, be traced and converted back to the real
world, would be the prime targets.

Virtual theft and virtual mugging are some of the newly coined terms for this type of attack. Security, in this
case, will depend on how much of the real world information is accessible, as well as the security framework
of the virtual world itself as defined and implemented by its administrator.
As rules and regulations for the protection of real physical assets, in connection with the Cyberspace, are
still being written, those pertaining to virtual assets are almost non-existent. Extra care and caution must be
undertaken by prospecting participants
ensure
proper protection of its virtual assets.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

9.1.3

Threats to organizational assets

Organizations’ online presence and online business are often targeted by miscreants whose intent is more than
plain mischief.
EXAMPLE 1
Organized Cybercrime syndicates often threaten organizations that their websites will be brought down,
or that they will be caused embarrassment through actions such as website defacement.
EXAMPLE 2
If an organization’s URL is registered or stolen by cyber-squatters and sold to organizations not related to
the real world organization, the online trust accorded to the victimised organization can be misplaced.

In the event of a successful attack, personal information from employees, clients, partners or suppliers could
be disclosed and result in sanctions, against the organizations, if it was found to have been managed or
protected insufficiently, contributing to the loss.
Financial filing regulations could also be breached if organizational results are disclosed in an unauthorized manner.
Governments hold information on national security, strategic, military, intelligence issues among many other
elements relating to the government and state, but also a vast array of information on individuals, organizations
and society as a whole.
Governments must protect its infrastructure and information from undue access and exploitation. With a growing
and expanding trend of offering e-government services through the Cyberspace, this is a new channel, among
others, to launch attacks and access the above information which, if successful, may result in serious risks to
a nation, its government and its society.
On a larger scale, the infrastructure that supports the Internet, and thus the Cyberspace, can be targeted as
well. While this will not affect the functioning of the Cyberspace permanently, it will affect the reliability and
availability of the infrastructure, which contributes to the security of the Cyberspace.
On a national or international level, the Cyberspace is a grey area in which terrorism thrives. One of the
reasons is the ease of communication provided by the Cyberspace. Due to the nature of the Cyberspace,
specifically the challenges in defining boundaries and borders, it is difficult to regulate and control the way that
it can be used.
Terrorist groups can either legitimately buy the applications, services and resources that facilitate their cause,
or they can resort to illegal means of securing these resources to avoid detection and tracking. This can include
acquiring massive computing resources through botnets.

9.2

Threat agents

A threat agent is an individual or group of individuals who have any role in the execution or support of an attack.
Thorough understanding of their motives (religious, political, economic, etc.), capabilities (knowledge, funding,
size, etc.) and intentions (fun, crime, espionage, etc.) is critical in the assessment of vulnerabilities and risks,
as well as in the development and deployment of controls.

9.3

Vulnerabilities

A vulnerability is a weakness of an asset or control that can be exploited by a threat. Within the context of an
information system, ISO/IEC TR 19791:2006 also defines vulnerability as a flaw, weakness or property of the
design or implementation of an information system (including its security controls) or its environment that could
be intentionally or unintentionally exploited to adversely affect an organization’s assets or operations.
Vulnerability assessment must be an on-going task. As systems receive patches, updates or new elements are
added, new vulnerabilities may be introduced. Stakeholders require a thorough knowledge and understanding
of the asset or control in question, as well as the threats, threat agents and risks involved, in order to perform
a comprehensive assessment.
NOTE

ISO/IEC 27005 provides guidelines on identifying vulnerabilities.

﻿

17

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

An inventory of known vulnerabilities should be kept with the strictest access protocol and preferably separate,
physically and logically, from the asset or control it is applicable to. Should a breach of access occur and the
vulnerability inventory be compromised, the vulnerability inventory would be one of the most effective tools in
the arsenal of a threat agent to use to perpetrate an attack.
Solutions to vulnerabilities must be sought, implemented and, when a solution is not possible or feasible,
controls must be put in place. This approach should be applied on a priority basis so the vulnerabilities posing
a higher risk are addressed first. Vulnerability disclosure procedures could be defined under the framework of
information sharing and coordination in clause 13 of this International Standard.
NOTE

9.4

A future International Standard, ISO/IEC 29147, will provide guidance on vulnerability disclosure.

Attack mechanisms

9.4.1

Introduction

Many of the attacks in the Cyberspace are carried out using malicious software, such as spyware, worms and
viruses. Information is often gathered through phishing techniques. An attack can occur as a singular attack
vector or carried out as a blended attack mechanism. These attacks can be propagated via, for example,
suspicious websites, unverified downloads, spam emails, remote exploitation, and infected removable media.
The attacks can come from two major categories:
—

Attacks from inside the private network; and

—

Attacks from outside the private network.

There are cases though that attacks are a combination of both inside and outside of a private network. Other
mechanisms growing in use and sophistication, for carrying out attacks, are those based on social networking
websites and the use of corrupted files on legitimate websites.
Individuals tend to implicitly trust messages and content received from contacts previously accepted in their
profiles on their social networking websites. Once an attacker, through identity theft, can disguise him/herself
as a legitimate contact, the attacker can engage others, and a new avenue is open for launching the various
types of attacks previously discussed.
Legitimate websites can also be hacked into and have some of its files corrupted and used as a means for
perpetrating attacks. Individuals tend to implicitly trust commonly visited websites, often bookmarked in their
Internet browsers for a long time, and even more those which use security mechanisms such as SSL (Secure
Sockets Layer). While party authentication and integrity of the information being transmitted or received are still
in place, SSL does not differentiate between the original content and the new corrupted content, planted by an
attacker, thus exposing users of that website to attacks.
Despite the perceived legitimate source, such as in instances like the above, individuals must still take the
precautions outlined in clause 11 to better protect themselves.
9.4.2

Attacks from inside the private network

These attacks are normally launched inside an organization’s private network, typically the local area network,
and can be initiated by employees or someone who gets access to a computer or network within an organization
or individual’s premises.
EXAMPLE 1
One possible case is that system administrators might take advantage of the system access privileges
that they hold, such as access to users’ password information, and use that to initiate an attack. On the other hand, system
administrators themselves can become the initial target of an attack, as a means for the attacker to obtain additional
information (usernames, passwords, etc.), before proceeding to their originally intended target or targets.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

The attacker can use mechanisms such as packet sniffer software to obtain passwords or other identity
information. Alternatively, the attacker can masquerade as an authorized entity and act as man-in-the-middle
to steal identity information.
EXAMPLE 2
One example is the use of rogue Access Points (AP) to steal identities. In this case, the attacker might sit
in an airport, coffee shop or other public places that offer free Wi-Fi access to the Internet. In some cases, the attacker
may even masquerade as the legitimate owner of the wireless access point on the premise by using the Service Set
IDentifier (SSID) of the premise. If a user accesses this rogue AP, the attacker can act as man-in-the-middle and obtain
valuable password and or identity information from the user, for example, bank account information and password, email
account password, etc.
EXAMPLE 3
Often, it is sufficient to be only near to a non-protected Wi-Fi network, such as sitting in a car outside a
house, to be able to steal information on the network.

Besides the attacks launched by human attackers, malware infected computers also launch various attacks to
surrounding computers inside the private network.
EXAMPLE 4
Many malwares often send scanning packets to the private network to find surrounding computers, and
then try to exploit discovered computers.
EXAMPLE 5
Some malware uses the promiscuous mode of a network interface of its infected computer in order to
eavesdrop on traffic flowing through the private network.
EXAMPLE 6
Key loggers are hardware or software applications that capture all key presses on the target system. This
can be done in secret to monitor a user’s actions. Key loggers are often utilized to capture authentication information from
application login pages.

9.4.3

Attacks from Outside the Private Network (e.g. Internet)

There are many different attacks that can be launched from outside the private network, including the Internet.
While the initial attack will always target a publicly facing system (e.g. router, server, firewall, website, etc.),
attackers may also be seeking to exploit assets residing inside the private network.
Old attack methods are improved and new ones are developed on an on-going basis. Attackers are increasingly
sophisticated and normally combine different attack techniques and mechanisms to maximize their success,
which makes attack detection and prevention even more difficult.
Port scanners are one of the oldest, and still very effective, tools used by attackers. They scan all ports
available on a server to confirm which ports are “open”. This normally is one of the first steps executed by a
prospective attacker on the target system.
These attacks can manifest into various DoS attacks to either the application servers or other networking
equipment by exploiting protocol or application design vulnerabilities.
EXAMPLE
With the help of a botnet, large scale DoS attacks can be launched that can bring down a country’s
access to the Cyberspace.

With the proliferation of peer-to-peer applications, commonly used to share files such as digital music, video,
photos, etc., attackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in how to disguise themselves and their
malicious code using the exchanged files as a trojan horse for their attacks.
Buffer overflows (a.k.a. buffer overruns) are another popular method of compromising servers on the Internet.
By exploiting coding vulnerabilities and sending much longer than expected strings of character, attackers
cause the server to operate outside its normal (controlled) environment, thus facilitating the insertion/execution
of malicious code.
Another technique is IP Spoofing, which consists in the attacker manipulating the IP address associated with his/her
messages in an attempt to disguise as a known, trusted source, thus gaining unauthorized access to systems.

10 Roles of stakeholders in Cybersecurity
10.1 Overview
To improve the state of Cybersecurity, stakeholders in the Cyberspace need to play an active role in their
respective use and development of the Internet. These roles may at times overlap with their individual and
organizational roles within their personal or organization networks. The term organization network refers to the
combination of an organization’s private networks (typically an intranet), extranets and publicly visible networks.
For the purpose of this International Standard, publicly visible networks are those networks exposed to the
Internet, for example to host a website. Because of this overlap, these roles can appear to have insignificant
or no direct benefit for the individual and organization concerned. They are, however, significant to enhancing
Cybersecurity when all involved act accordingly.

10.2 Roles of consumers
10.2.1 Introduction
Consumers can view or collect information, as well as provide certain specific information within a Cyberspace
application’s space, or open to limited members or groups within the application’s space, or the general public.
Actions taken by consumers in these roles can be passive or active, and can contribute directly and indirectly
to the state of Cybersecurity.
10.2.2 Roles of individuals
Individual consumers of the Cyberspace may assume different roles in different context and applications.
Consumer roles can include, but are not limited to, the following:
—

General Cyberspace application user, or general user, such as online game player, instant messenger
user, or web surfer;

—

Buyer/seller, involved in placing goods and services on online auction and marketplace sites for interested
buyers, and vice versa;

—

Blogger and other contents contributor (for example, an author of an article on a wiki), in which information in text
and multimedia (for example, video clips) are published for general public or limited audience’s consumption;

—

IAP within an application context (such as an online game), or the Cyberspace in general;

—

Member of an organization (such as an employee of a company, or other form of associating with a company);

—

Other roles. It is possible that a user can be assigned a role unintentionally or without his or her consent.

EXAMPLE
When a user visits a site which requires authorization, and unintentionally gains access, the user may be
labelled as an intruder.

In each of these roles, individuals can view or collect information, as well as provide certain specific information
within a Cyberspace application’s space, or open to limited members or groups within the application’s space,
or the general public. Actions taken by individuals in these roles can be passive or active, and can contribute
directly and indirectly to the state of Cybersecurity.
EXAMPLE 1
If an IAP provides an application that contains security vulnerabilities, these vulnerabilities can be used
by Cyber miscreants as a channel to reach users of the application.
EXAMPLE 2
Bloggers or other forms of content contributors can receive a request in the form of innocent questions about
their contents. In their reply, they can unintentionally reveal more personal or company information to the public than desired.
EXAMPLE 3
An individual, acting as buyer or seller, can unknowingly participate in criminal transactions of selling
stolen goods or money laundry activities.

Consequently, as in the real world, individual consumers need to exercise caution in each and every role they
Licensed to Mr. PEDDINTI
play in the Cyberspace.

10.2.3 Roles of organizations
Organizations often use the Cyberspace to publicise company and related information, as well as market
related products and services. Organizations also utilize the Cyberspace as part of their network for delivery
and receipt of electronic messages (for example, emails) and other documents (for example, file transfer).
In line with the same principles of being a good corporate citizen, these organizations should extend their
corporate responsibilities to the Cyberspace by proactively ensuring that their practices and actions in the
Cyberspace do not introduce further security risks into the Cyberspace. Some proactive measures include:
—

proper information security management by implementing and operating an effective information security
management system (ISMS);

NOTE 1

ISO/IEC 27001 provides requirements for information security management systems.

—

proper security monitoring and response;

—

incorporating security as part of the Software Development Life-cycle (SDLC), where the level of security
built into systems needs to be determined based on the organization’s criticality of data;

—

regular security education of users in the organization through continuous technology updates and keeping
track of latest technology developments; and

—

understanding and using proper channels in communicating with vendors and service providers on security
issues discovered during usage.

NOTE 2

A future International Standard, ISO/IEC 29147, will provide guidelines on vulnerability disclosure.

NOTE 3

ISO/IEC 27031 provides guidelines for ICT readiness for business continuity.

NOTE 4

ISO/IEC 27035 provides guidelines for information security incident management.

NOTE 5

ISO/IEC 27034-1 provides guidelines for application security.

The government, primarily law enforcement agencies and regulators, may have the following important roles to play:
—

advise organizations of their roles and responsibilities in the Cyberspace;

—

share information with other stakeholders on the latest trends and developments in technology;

—

share information with other stakeholders on the current prevalent security risks;

—

be a conduit for receiving any information, whether close or open, with regard to security risks to the
Cyberspace; and

—

be the primary coordinator for information dissemination and orchestrating any required resources, both
at national-level or corporate level, in times of crisis arising from a massive cyber-attack.

10.3 Roles of providers
Service providing organizations can include two categories:
—

providers of access to employees and partners to the Cyberspace, and

—

providers of services to consumers of the Cyberspace, either to a closed community (for example,
registered users), or the general public, through the delivery of Cyberspace applications

EXAMPLE
Examples of services are online trading marketplaces; discussion forum platform services; blogging
platform services; and social networking services.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

Service providers are also consumer organizations. They are thus are expected to observe the same roles
and responsibilities as consumer organizations. As service providers, they have additional responsibilities in
maintaining or even enhancing security of the Cyberspace by:
—

providing safe and secure products and services;

—

providing safety and security guidance for end-users; and

—

providing security inputs to other providers and to consumers about trends and observations of traffic in
their networks and services.

11 Guidelines for stakeholders
11.1 Overview
The guidance in this clause focuses on three main areas:
—

security guidance for consumers;

—

internal information security risk management of an organization; and

—

security requirements that providers should specify for consumers to implement.

The recommendations are structured as follows:
a)

an introduction to risk assessment and treatment;

b)

guidelines for consumers; and

c)

guidelines for organizations, including service providers:
—

management of information security risk in the business; and

—

security requirements for hosting services and other application services.

11.2 Risk assessment and treatment
ISO 31000, Risk management – Principles and guidelines, provides principles and generic guidelines on risk
management while ISO/IEC 27005, Information technology – Security techniques – Information security risk
management, provides guidelines and processes for information security risk management in an organization,
supporting in particular the requirements of an ISMS according to ISO/IEC 27001. These guidelines and
processes are considered sufficient for addressing risk management in the context of the Cyberspace.
ISO/IEC 27005:2011 does not provide any specific methodology for information security risk management. It is up
to the consumers and providers to define their approach to risk management. A number of existing methodologies
can be used under the framework described in ISO/IEC 27005 to implement the requirements of an ISMS.
The following aspects have to be taken into account when defining an approach to risk management:
—

Identification of critical assets: Connecting to or utilizing the Cyberspace broadens the scope of defining
assets. As it is not cost-effective to protect all assets, it is essential that the critical assets be identified so that
particular care may be taken to protect them. The designation should be made from the business context,
through consideration of the impact of the loss or degradation of an asset on the business as a whole.

—

Identification of risks: Stakeholders should properly consider and address the additional risks, threats and
attacks that become relevant when participating in the Cyberspace.

—

Responsibility: By participating in the Cyberspace, a stakeholder should accept the added responsibility
towards other stakeholders. This includes:
—

in other stakeholders’ information systems.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

—

Reporting: It may be necessary to include stakeholders outside the organization when distributing
reports related to risks, incidents and threats.

—

Information sharing: As with reporting, it may be necessary to share relevant information with other
stakeholders.

—

Risk assessment: It is necessary to determine the extent to which a stakeholder’s actions and
presence in the Cyberspace becomes, or contributes to, a risk for another stakeholder.

—

Regulatory/Legislative: By connecting to the Cyberspace, the legal and regulatory boundaries become
difficult to distinguish, and more, sometimes contradictory, requirements are applicable.

—

System or service retirement: Once a system or service is no longer needed, it should be retired in a way
that ensures that related services or interfaces are not impacted. All security-related information must be
invalidated to ensure that the systems to which it interfaced or are related to are not compromised.

—

Consistency: The approach to risk management applies across the entire Cyberspace. Within this
approach or methodology, Cyberspace consumers and providers are assigned responsibilities for specific
activities, such as contingency planning, disaster recovery, and the development and implementation of
protective programs for the systems under their control and/or ownership.

In general, the risk management methodology in ISO/IEC27005 covers the full life-cycle of a generic system,
thus making it usable for new security systems as well as for legacy systems. Since it deals with the treatment
of systems, it is applicable to all business models. The processes within the framework may treat the service
providers’ networks and services as an integrated system, consisting of subsystems that provide public
services and private subsystems that support internal services, or it may treat each of the individual services
(e.g., web hosting) separately, and describe their provision in terms of separate interacting systems. It may be
advantageous, for simplicity, to consider everything that is needed to support the provider’s services as a large
system that can be decomposed into smaller systems, each of which provides a marketable service or forms
part of the infrastructure.
Important aspects to remember when considering the goals and objectives of Cybersecurity are:
a)

protect the overall security of the Cyberspace;

b)

plan for emergencies and crises through participation in exercise, and update response plans and plans
for continuity of operations;

c)

educate stakeholders on Cybersecurity and risk management practices;

d)

ensure timely, relevant and accurate threat information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence
communities and key decision makers relevant to the Cyberspace; and

e)

establish effective cross-sector and cross-stakeholder coordination mechanisms to address critical
interdependencies, including incident situational awareness and cross-sector and cross-stakeholder
incident management.

Goals and objectives a) to c) flow down directly to the service providers, who are responsible for the equipment
and services under their control. For goals and objectives d) and e), the service providers are involved as active
participants in the information sharing and coordination activities.
Specific service provider goals, such as what services to supply, flow down from the business context.

11.3 Guidelines for consumers
This International Standard is not directed at individuals of the Cyberspace specifically, but focuses on
organizations providing services to consumers, and organizations that require their employees or end-users to
practice secure use of the Cyberspace to manage the Cybersecurity risk effectively. The guidance on the roles
and security of users in the Cyberspace and how they could positively influence the state of Cybersecurity
aims to serve as a guide for the design and development contents by these organizations, in the context of their
service provisioning and awareness and training programs for delivery to their end-users.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

As explained in clause 10.2, consumers can view or collect information, as well as provide certain specific
information within a Cyberspace application’s space, or open to limited members or groups within the
application’s space, or the general public. Actions taken by consumers in these roles can be passive or active,
and can contribute directly and indirectly to the state of Cybersecurity.
For example, as an IAP, if the application provided contains security vulnerabilities, they could result in
exploitation by cyber-miscreants leveraging them as a channel to reach innocent users of the application. As
bloggers or other forms of contents contributors, they can receive a request in the form of innocent questions on
their contents in which they can unintentionally reveal more personal or company information to the public than
desired. As a buyer or seller, a consumer can unknowingly participate in criminal transactions of selling stolen
goods or money laundering activities. Consequently, as in the physical world, consumers need to exercise
caution in each and every role they play in the Cyberspace.
In general, consumers should take note of the following guidance:
a)

Learn and understand the security and privacy policy of the site and application concerned, as published
by the site provider.

b)

Learn and understand the security and privacy risks involved and determine appropriate controls applicable.
Participate in related online discussion forums or ask someone who knows about the site or application before
providing personal or organization information, or participating and contributing information to the discussion.

c)

Establish and practice a personal privacy policy for identity protection by determining the categories of
personal information available and sharing principles relating to that information.

d)

Manage online identity. Use different identifiers for different web applications, and minimize the sharing
of personal information to each website or application requesting such information. Register one’s online
identity on popular social networking sites even if the account is left dormant.

EXAMPLE

Single sign on is a form of online identity management.

e)

Report suspicious events or encounters to the relevant authorities (see Annex B for as an example of a
publicly available list of contacts).

f)

As a buyer or seller, read and understand the online marketplace’s site security and privacy policy, and
take steps to verify the authenticity of the interested parties involved. Do not share personal data, including
banking information, unless a genuine interest to sell or buy has been established. Use a trustworthy
payment mechanism.

g)

As an IAP, practice secure software development and provide a hash value of the code online so that
receiving parties can verify the value if necessary to ensure integrity of the code. Provide documentation
of the code security and privacy policies and practices and respect the privacy of code users.

h)

As a blogger or other content contributor (including website maintainers), ensure that applicable
stakeholder privacy and sensitive information are not disclosed through the blogs or online publications.
Review comments and postings received on the site and ensure that they do not contain any malicious
content such as links to phishing websites or malicious downloads.

i)

As a member of an organization, an individual consumer should learn and understand the organization’s
corporate information security policy and ensure that classified and/or sensitive information are not
released intentionally or by accident on any websites in the Cyberspace, unless prior authorization for
such disclosure has been formally granted.

j)

Other roles. When a consumer visits a site which requires authorization, and unintentionally gains access,
the user may be labelled as an intruder. Exit the site immediately and report to the relevant authority, since
the fact that it was possible to gain access can be an indication of a compromise.

11.4 Guidelines for organizations and service providers
11.4.1 Overview
Controls for managing Cybersecurity risks depend significantly on the maturity of the security management
processes within organizations (including service providers). While the guidelines suggested here are mainly
discretionary for organizations, it is recommended that service providers treat the guidelines as baseline
mandatory measures.
The guidelines in this clause can be summarized as:
—

Manage information security risk in the business.

—

Address security requirements for hosting web and other cyber-application services.

—

Provide security guidance to consumers.

11.4.2 Manage information security risk in the business
11.4.2.1 Information security management system
At the enterprise level, organizations connecting to the Cyberspace should implement an information security
management system (ISMS) to identify and manage related information security risk to the business. The
ISO/IEC 27000 series of International Standards for information security management systems provides the
required guidance and best practices for implementing such a system.
A key consideration in implementing an ISMS is to ensure that the organization has a system to continuously
identify, assess, treat, and manage information security risk relating to its business, including the provision of
services on the Internet, directly to end-users or subscribers, should it be a service provider.
NOTE 1
ISO/IEC 27005, Information technology – Security techniques – Information security risk management,
provides guidelines for information security risk management in an organization, supporting in particular the requirements
of an ISMS according to ISO/IEC 27001.
NOTE 2
ISO 31000, Risk management – Principles and guidelines, provides principles and generic guidelines on
risk management.

Organizations may also consider a formal certification of its compliance with ISMS requirements, such as
ISO/IEC 27001.
As part of the implementation of an ISMS, an organization should also establish a security incident monitoring
and response capability and coordinate their incident response activities with external CIRT, CERT, or CSIRT
organizations in the country. The incident and emergency response provision should include monitoring and
assessing the security status of th use of the organization’s services by end-users and customers, and provide
guidance to assist the affected parties in responding to security incidents effectively.
NOTE
ISO/IEC 27035, Information technology – Security techniques – Information security incident management,
provides guidance on information security incident management.

11.4.2.2 Provide secure products
Some organizations develop1) and release their own web browser toolbars, diallers, or code to provide valueadded services to end-users, or facilitate ease of access to the organization’s services or applications. In such
instances, there should be a proper end-user agreement in a suitable language, incorporating statements
about the organization’s coding policy, privacy policy, and means whereby users can change their acceptance
later or escalate any issues they might have regarding the policy and practices. When such an agreement is
used, it should be placed under version control and the organization should make sure that end-users sign it
consistently.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

Where there is a high degree of reliance on the security of software products, these should be independently
validated under the Common Criteria scheme, as described at ISO/IEC 15408.
Organizations should document code behaviour and make an assessment as to whether the behaviour can
fall in potential areas that might be considered as spyware or deceptive software. In the latter case, it should
engage a suitably qualified assessor to evaluate whether the code fall within anti-spyware vendors objective
criteria that adheres to best practices so that the organization-provided software tools for the end-users, would
not be labelled as spyware or adware by anti-spyware vendors. Many anti-spyware vendors publish the criteria
by which they rate software.
Organizations should implement digital code signing for their binaries so that anti-malware and anti-spyware
vendors could easily determine the owner of a file, and ISVs, who consistently produce software that follows
best practices, would be categorized as being likely secure even prior to analysis.
Should an organization discover useful software techniques that could help to reduce the spyware or malware
problem, the organization should consider partnering and working with the vendor to make them broadly available.
In order to fulfill these requirements, security education of developers is very important. A secure software
development life cycle should be used where software vulnerabilities can be minimized hence providing a more
secure software product.
NOTE
ISO/IEC 27034, Information technology – Security techniques – Application security, provides guidelines to
define, develop, implement, manage, support and retire an application.

11.4.2.3 Network monitoring and response
Network monitoring is commonly used by organizations to ensure reliability and quality of their network services.
At the same time, this capability can be leveraged to look for exceptional network traffic conditions and detect
malicious activities emerging on the network. In general, organizations should perform the following:
—

Understand the traffic on the network – what is normal, what is not normal.

—

Use a network management tool to identify spikes in traffic, “unusual” traffic/ports and ensure that there
are tools available to pinpoint and respond to the cause.

—

Test the response capability before they are needed for an actual event. Refine the response techniques,
processes and tools based on the result of regular drills.

—

Understand the constituents on an individual basis – if someone who is normally an inactive user suddenly
starts capping out at 100 percent of available bandwidth, it may be necessary to isolate the contravening
user until the reason can be found. Network isolation can prevent the spread of malware though some
implementations can require user consent or updates to a Terms of Service.

—

Consider monitoring of activity from intelligence points in the network such as DNS and messaging filters,
which can also serve to flag devices that have been compromised with malware but, for a variety of
reasons, are not detected by anti-virus or IDS services.

EXAMPLE
Due to the volume of information on the network, tools such as IDS and IPS can be used to monitor for
reportable exceptions.

11.4.2.4 Support and escalation
Businesses, including service providers and government organizations normally have a support service to
answer customers queries and provide technical assistance and support to address end-users’ problems. With
the increasing proliferating of malware on the Internet, a service providing organization can receive reports
relating to malware and spyware infections and other Cybersecurity issues. Such information are important and
useful for relevant vendors to assess the risk and malware situation, and provide updates to necessary tools
to ensure that any new malware or spyware detected can be removed or disabled effectively. In this regard, an
organization should establish contact with security vendors and submit relevant reports and malware samples
to the vendors for follow-up – particularly if there appears to be a spike in prevalence. Most vendors maintain an
email list for receiving such reports or samples for analysis and follow-up. For example, see Table B.1 in Annex B.

11.4.2.5 Keeping up-to-date with latest developments
As part of the ISMS implementation to manage the enterprise information security risk, and also ensure that
organizations continue to follow-up industry best practices and keep tap with the latest vulnerabilities and
exploits/attacks situation, organizations should participate in relevant community or industry forums to share
their best practices and learn from other fellow providers.
11.4.3 Security requirements for hosting web and other cyber-application services
Most service providers provide hosting services on their network and data centre as part of their business
services. These services, which include websites and other online applications, are often re-packaged and resold by hosting subscribers to other consumers, such as small businesses and end-users. Should the hosting
subscribers set up an insecure server, or host malicious contents in their sites or applications, the security
of the consumers will be adversely affected. As such, it is important that services, at a minimum, meet best
practices standards by complying with policy or terms of agreements.
Where multiple providers are used, the interaction between the providers should be analysed and the respective
service agreements should address any critical interaction. For example, updates or patches to one provider’s
systems should be coordinated with other providers, should the update result in a negative interaction.
The terms of agreements should at least cover the following:
a)

Clear Notices, describing the online site or application security and privacy practices, data collection
practices, and the behaviour of any code (for example, Browser Helper Object) that the online site or
application can distribute and execute in end-user desktops or web browser environments.

b)

User Consent, facilitating user’s agreement or disagreement with the terms of services described in the
Notices. This would allow a user to exercise discretion and determine whether he/she can accept the
terms of services accordingly.

c)

User Controls, facilitating users to change their settings or otherwise terminate their acceptance anytime
in the future after the initial agreement.

The terms are important to ensure that the end-users are clear about the behaviour and practices of the online
site or application, in relation to the end-users’ privacy and security. The terms should be developed with the
aid of a legal professional to ensure that they will also indemnify the service provider from potential legal action
from the end-users, as a result of specific losses or harm incurred due to malicious contents or unclear policies
and practices on the website.
In addition to the data protection and personal privacy provisions on the online site or application, service
providers should require online sites or applications hosted on their networks to implement a set of best
practices security controls at the application level before they could go live. These should include but are not
limited to examples given in clause 12.2.
As part of a service provider’s hosting infrastructure, servers should be protected against unauthorized access
and the ability to host malicious content. See clause 12.3 for examples of controls.
To permit the enforcement of these security controls, in particular, those relating to the online site and application
security, service providers should consider incorporating these provisions in the terms of services agreements.
11.4.4 Security guidance for consumers
Service providers should provide guidance to consumers on how to stay secure online. Service providers
may either create the guidance directly, or refer the users to available guidance sites that could provide the
contents. It is critical to educate end-users on how they can contribute to a secure Internet in relation to the
multiple roles that they can play in the Cyberspace, as described in clause 7. In addition, end-users should be
advised to take necessary technical security controls in which service providers could also play an active role,
as described in clause 11.3. Examples of guidance activities may include:
a)

Periodic (for example, monthly) security newsletters to advise on specific security techniques (for
example, how to choose
a good
updates on security trends; and to provide notices of security

webcasts, other on-demand videos, audio broadcasts, and security information that are available from the
organization’s web portal or other security content providers.
b)

Direct broadcasts of on-demand security education videos or webcasts covering a variety of security
topics to improve end-users’ security practices and awareness.

c)

Incorporating a security column in the service provider’s hard-copy newsletter that are sent to end-users’
resident or office addresses to highlight key security events or contents.

d)

Annual or other periodic end-user security seminars or road shows, possibly in partnership with other
industry players, vendors, and governments.

Service providers using email as the primary way of communicating with end-users should do so in a way that
helps end-users resist social engineering attacks. In particular, end-users should be consistently reminded that
unsolicited emails from the service provider will never ask for
—

personal information;

—

user names;

—

passwords; and

will never include security related links for the reader to click on.

When a service provider wishes a user to go to its site for information they should tell the user how to safely
connect to the required URL. For example, they might ask a user to type a quoted URL into their browser and
make sure that the quoted URL does not contain a clickable link.
As part of the user security education and guidance against deceptive software and spyware, organizations
and service providers should advise their end-users on the use of suitable technical security controls to protect
their systems against known exploits and attacks. As a general guide, consumers should be encouraged to
implement the controls in clause 12.4.
Annex B provides an example list of references and online resources that could be used to support the
implementation of the above recommendations.

12 Cybersecurity controls
12.1 Overview
Once the risks to Cybersecurity are identified and appropriate guidelines are drafted, Cybersecurity controls that
support the security requirements can be selected and implemented. This clause gives an overview of the key
Cybersecurity controls that can be implemented to support the guidelines laid out in this International Standard.

12.2 Application level controls
Application level controls include the following:
a)

Display of short notices, which provide clear, concise one-page summaries (using simple language) of the
company’s essential online policies. With this, users are able to make more informed choices about sharing
their information online. The short notices should conform to all regulatory requirements and provide links to full
legal statements and other relevant information, so customers who want more detail can easily click through to
read the longer version. With a single notice, customers can have a more consistent experience across all of
the company’s properties, with the same privacy standards and expectations extended to many sites.

b)

Secure handling of sessions for web applications; this can include online mechanisms such as cookies.

c)

Secure input validation and handling to prevent common attacks such as SQL-Injection. Based on the fact
that websites, which are generally considered as trustworthy, are increasingly used for malicious code
distribution, input and output validation have to be carried out by active content as well as by dynamic content.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

d)

Secure web page scripting to prevent common attacks such as Cross-site Scripting.

e)

Code security review and testing by appropriately skilled entities.

f)

The organization’s service, whether provided by the organization or by a party representing the organization,
should be provided in a fashion that the consumer can authenticate the service. This may include having
the provider use a sub-domain from the organization’s branded domain name and possibly the use of
HTTPS credentials registered to the organization. The service should avoid the use of deceptive methods
where the consumer may have difficulty determining with whom they are dealing.

12.3 Server protection
The following controls can be used to protect servers against unauthorized access and the hosting of malicious
content on servers:
a)

Configure servers, including underlying operating systems in accordance to a baseline security configuration
guide. This guide should include proper definition of server users versus administrators, enforcement of
access controls on program and system directories and files, and enabling of audit trails, in particular, for
security and other failure events on the system. Furthermore it is recommended to install a minimal system
on a server in order to reduce the attack vector.

b)

Implement a system to test and deploy security updates, and ensure the server operating system and
applications are kept up-to-date promptly when new security updates are available.

c)

Monitor the security performance of the server through regular reviews of the audit trails.

d)

Review the security configuration.

e)

Run anti-malicious software controls (such as anti-virus and anti-spyware) on the server.

f)

Scan all hosted and uploaded content regularly using up to date anti-malicious software controls. Recognize
that a file can, for example, still be spyware or malware even if not detected by the current controls due to
the constraints of imperfect information.

g)

Perform regular vulnerability assessments and security testing for the online sites and applications to
ensure that their security is adequately maintained.

h)

Regularly scan for compromises.

12.4 End-user controls
The following is an incomplete list of controls that end-users can use to protect their systems against known
exploits and attacks:
a)

Use of supported operating systems, with the most updated security patches installed. Organizational
consumers have a responsibility to be aware of, and follow, organizational policy regarding supported
operating systems. Individual consumers should be aware of, and consider using, provider recommended
operating systems. In all cases, the operating system should be kept up to date regarding security patches.

b)

Use of the latest supported software applications, with the most updated patches installed. Organizational
consumers have a responsibility to be aware of, and follow, organizational policy regarding supported
application software. Individual consumers should be aware of, and consider using, provider recommended
application software. In all cases, the application software should be kept up to date regarding security patches.

c)

Use anti-virus and anti-spyware tools. If feasible, a service provider such as an ISP should consider
partnering with trusted security vendors to offer end-users these tools as part of the service subscription
package so that the security controls are made available upon signing-up the subscription, or upon renewal.
Organizational consumers have a responsibility to be aware of, and follow, organizational policy regarding
the use of security software tools. Individual consumers should use security software tools. They should
look to the provider for any recommended, provided, or discontinued security software. In all cases, the
security software should
be kept up to date regarding security patches and signature databases.

﻿

29

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

d)

Implement appropriate anti-virus and anti-spyware safeguards. Common web browser and browser
toolbars have now incorporated capabilities such as pop-up blockers, which will prevent malicious websites
from displaying windows that contain spyware or deceptive software that could exploit system or browser
weaknesses, or use social engineering to trick users into downloading and installing them on their systems.
Organizations should establish a policy to enable the use of such tools. Service providing organizations
should collate a list of recommended tools, and their use should be encouraged to end-users, with guidance
on their enablement and permission granting for websites that users would like to allow.

e)

Enable script blockers. Enable script blockers or a higher web security setting to ensure that only scripts
from trusted sources are executed on a local computer.

f)

Use phishing filters. Common web browser and browser toolbars often incorporates this capability,
which could determine whether a site that a user is visiting is found within a database of known phishing
websites, or contains script patterns that are similar to those found typical phishing websites. The browser
would provide alerts, normally in the form of colour-coded highlights, to warn users of the potential risk.
Organizations should establish a policy to enable the use of such tool.

g)

Use other available web browser security features. From time to time, as new Cybersecurity risk emerges,
web browsers and browser toolbar providers add new security capabilities to protect users against risks.
End-users should keep abreast of these developments by learning about such updates that are normally
provided by the tool providers. Organizations and service providers should similarly review these new
capabilities and update related policies and services to better serve the needs of their organizations and
customers, and address related Cybersecurity risk.

h)

Enable a personal firewall and HIDS. Personal firewalls and HIDS are important tools for controlling network
services accessing the user systems. A number of newer operating systems have personal firewalls and
HIDS incorporated. While they are enabled by default, users or applications might disable them, resulting
in undesirable network security exposures. Organizations should adopt a policy on the use of a personal
firewall and HIDS and evaluate suitable tools or products for implementation so that their use is enabled
by default for all employees. Service providers should encourage the use of a personal firewall and HIDS
functions, and/or suggest other third-party personal firewall and HIDS products that has been evaluated
and considered as trusted, and educate and help users in enabling basic network security at the end-user
system level.

i)

Enable automated updates. While the above technical security controls are capable of dealing with most
malicious software at their respective operating levels, they are not very effective against exploitation
of vulnerabilities that exist in operating systems and application products. To prevent such exploits, the
updating function available in operating systems, as well as those provided by user-trusted applications
(for example, trusted third-party evaluated anti-spyware and anti-virus products), should be enabled for
automated updates to be performed. This would then ensure that systems are updated with the latest
security patches whenever they are available, closing the time gap for exploits to take place.

12.5 Controls against social engineering attacks
12.5.1 Overview
Cybercriminals are increasingly resorting to psychological or social engineering tactics in order to succeed.
EXAMPLE 1

The use of emails carrying URI directing unsuspecting users to phishing websites.

EXAMPLE 2
Scam mails requesting users to provide personal identification information, or information relating to
corporate intellectual property.

The proliferation of social networking and community sites provides new vehicles that further enable more
believable scams and frauds to be conducted. Increasingly, such attacks are also transcending technology,
beyond the PC systems and traditional network connectivity, leveraging mobile phones, wireless networks
(including Bluetooth), and voice-over-IP (VoIP).

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

This clause provides a framework of controls applicable for managing and minimizing the Cybersecurity risk in
relation to social engineering attacks. The guidance provided in this clause is based on the notion that the only
effective way to mitigate the threat of social engineering is through the combination of:
—

security technologies;

—

security policies that set ground rules for personal behaviour, both as an individual and as an employee; and

—

appropriate education and training.

The framework therefore covers:
—

policies;

—

methods and processes;

—

people and organizations; and

—

applicable technical controls.

12.5.2 Policies
In line with common practices for information security risk management, basic policies governing the creation,
collection, storage, transmission, sharing, processing and general use of organizational and personal
information and intellectual property on the Internet and in the Cyberspace should be determined and
documented. In particular, this relates to applications such as instant messaging, blogging, P2P file sharing,
and social networking, which are normally beyond the scope of enterprise network and information security.
As part of corporate policies, statements and penalties relating to the misuse of Cyberspace applications should
also be incorporated to deter against practices of misuse by employees and third-parties on the corporate
network or systems accessing the Cyberspace.
Administrative policies promoting awareness and understanding of Cybersecurity risks, and encouraging,
if not mandating, the learning and development of skills against Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, social
engineering attacks, should be developed and promulgated. This should include requirements for regular
attendance to such briefings and training.
By promoting suitable policies and awareness on social engineering risks, employees can no longer claim
ignorance of such risks and requirements, and at the same time develop an understanding of best practices
and policies expected of external social networking and other Cyberspace applications, for example, the
security policy agreement of the service provider.
12.5.3 Methods and processes
12.5.3.1 Categorization and classification of information
To support policies to promote awareness and protection of corporate classified and personal sensitive
information, including intellectual properties, processes for categorization and classification of information
should be implemented.
For each category and classification of information involved, specific security controls for protection against
accidental exposure, and intended unauthorized access should be developed and documented.
Users in organizations could then differentiate between the different categories and classification of information
that they generate, collect, and handle. Users can then exercise the required caution and protective controls
when using the Cyberspace.
Procedures on how to handle company intellectual properties, personal data, and other confidential information
should also be developed and promulgated.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

12.5.3.2 Awareness and training
Security awareness and training, including regular updating of relevant knowledge and learning are an important
element for countering social engineering attacks.
As part of an organization’s Cybersecurity program, employees and third-parties contractors should be
required to undergo a minimum number of hours of awareness training in order to ensure that they are aware
of their roles and responsibilities in the Cyberspace, and technical controls that they should implement as
individuals using the Cyberspace. In addition, as part of the program to counter social engineering attacks,
such awareness training should include contents such as the following:
a)

The latest threats and forms of social engineering attacks, for example, how phishing has evolved from
fake websites alone to a combination of Spam, Cross Site Scripting, and SQL Injection attacks.

b)

How individual and corporate information can be stolen and manipulated through social engineering attacks,
providing understanding on how attackers can take advantage of human nature, such as a tendency to
comply to requests that are made with authority (even though it can be unreal), friendly demeanour, posing
as a victim, and reciprocation by first giving something of value or help.

c)

What information needs to be protected and how to protect it, in accordance with the information security policy.

d)

When to report or escalate a suspected event or malicious application to approach authorities or response
agency, and information on these contacts available. For example, see Annex B.

Organizations providing Cyberspace applications and services online should provide awareness materials to
subscribers or consumers covering the above contents within the context of their applications or services.
12.5.3.3 Testing
Employees should sign an acknowledgement that they accept and understand the contents of the organization’s
security policy. As part of the process to improve awareness and ensure due attention to such risk, an
organization should consider conducting periodic tests to determine the level of awareness and compliance
with related policies and practices. Employees can perform a written test or undergo CBT to determine if they
understand the contents of the organization’s security policy. Such tests may include but are not limited to the
creation of targeted but controlled phishing sites, Spam, and scam mails using believable social engineering
contents. When conducting such tests, it is important to ensure that:
a)

the test servers and contents are all within the control and command of the testing team;

b)

professionals who have prior experience of running such a test are engaged where possible;

c)

users are prepared for such tests through the awareness and training programs; and

d)

all test results are presented in aggregated format in order to protect an individuals’ privacy as the content
presented in such tests can embarrass individuals and cause privacy concerns if not adequately managed.

NOTE: The ethics and legislation of each country must be taken into consideration.

12.5.4 People and organization
While individuals are the primary targets of social engineering attacks, an organization can also be the intended
victim. People, however, remain the main entry point for social engineering attacks. As such, people need to
be aware of related risks in the Cyberspace, and organizations should establish relevant policies and take
proactive steps to sponsor related programs to ensure people’s awareness and competency.
As a general guide, all organizations (including enterprise, service providers, and government) should
encourage consumers in the Cyberspace to learn and understand social engineering risks in the Cyberspace,
and the steps they should take to protect themselves against potential attacks.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

12.5.5 Technical
In addition to establishing policies and practices against social engineering attacks, technical controls should
also be considered and where possible, adopted to minimize exposure and potential for cyber miscreants’
exploitations.
At the personal level, Cyberspace users should adopt the guidance discussed in clause 11.3.
Organizations and service providers should undertake relevant steps described in clause 11.4.4 to facilitate
users’ adoption and use of technical security controls.
Organizations and service providers should also adopt the guidance provided in clause 11.4, which are
important as baseline controls against social engineering attacks in the Cyberspace.
In addition, the following technical controls that are useful against specific social engineering attacks should
be considered:
a)

Where personal or corporate sensitive information are involved in online applications, consider the
provision of strong authentication solutions either as part of the login authentication, and/or when critical
transactions are being executed. Strong authentication refers to the use of two or more additional factors
of identity verification, over and above the use of a user ID and password. The second and additional
factors may be provided using smartcard, biometrics, or other hand-held security tokens.

b)

For web-based services, organizations should consider the use of a “High Assurance Certificate” to provide
added assurance to online users. Most commercial Certification Authorities (CA) and Internet browsers
are capable of supporting the use of such certificates, which reduce the threat of phishing attacks.

c)

To ensure the security of users’ computers connecting to the organization or service provider’s site or
application in the Cyberspace, additional controls to ensure a minimum level of security, such as installation
of latest security updates, should be considered. Use of such controls should be published in the End-user
Service Agreement and/or the Site Privacy and Security Policy whichever is applicable.

12.6 Cybersecurity readiness
Annex A describes additional technical controls that are applicable for improving an organization’s Cybersecurity
readiness in the area of event detection, through Darknet Monitoring, investigation, through Traceback, and
response, through Sinkhole Operation.

12.7 Other controls
Other controls may include controls related to alerting and quarantine of devices which are engaging in
suspicious activity as observed through correlation of events from service provider and/or enterprise elements
such as DNS servers, router net flow, outbound message filtering and peer-to-peer communications.

13 Framework of information sharing and coordination
13.1 General
Cybersecurity incidents often cross national geographical and organizational boundaries, and the speed of
information flow and changes from the unfolding incident often gives limited time for the responding individuals
and organizations to act. A system needs to be established for information sharing and coordination to help
prepare and respond to Cybersecurity events and incidents. This is an important step that organizations should
take as part of their Cybersecurity controls. Such a system for information sharing and coordination should be
secure, effective, reliable and efficient.
The system should be secure to ensure that the information being shared, including details about the
coordination of activities, are protected against unauthorized access, in particular by the perpetrator of the
incident concerned. Security of information relating to Cybersecurity events is also necessary to prevent
misinterpretation and causing
undue panic or alarms to the public. At the same time, integrity and authenticity

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

of information are critical to ensure its accuracy and reliability irrespective of whether such information is
shared within a closed group, or disclosed publicly. The system should be effective and efficient so that it
serves its purpose with minimum resources and within the required time and space.
This clause provides a basic framework for implementing a system for information sharing and coordination.
The framework includes four areas for consideration, namely, policies, methods and processes, people, and
technical elements.
NOTE
ITU-T’s Study Group 17 is undertaking extensive work on Cybersecurity information exchange. Refer to
Table C.17 — Cybersecurity information exchange for further information.

13.2 Policies
13.2.1 Information providing organizations and Information receiving organizations
For the purpose of this framework, two types of information sharing organizations are introduced:
—

IPO, and

—

IRO.

As IPO, basic policies with regard to the classification and categorization of information, the severity of
events and incidents, and the form of sharing possible should be determined prior to the occurrence of any
Cybersecurity incidents, or any sharing takes place (in the case of an IPO turning into an IRO to share received
information with other authorized entities in the information chain).
At the receiving end, IRO should agree to enforce the security protection and relevant procedures upon
receiving information from the IPO, in accordance with the agreement previously reached, and based on the
classification and categorization of information involved.
13.2.2 Classification and categorization of information
IPOs should determine the different categories of information that they collect, collate, safe-keep, and distribute.
Examples of information categories can include security events, security threats, security vulnerabilities,
suspected/confirmed perpetrators’ profiles, organized groups, victims’ information, and ICT system profile categories.
For each category, it should be further broken down into two or more classifications based on the contents of
the information involved. The minimum classification may be sensitive and unrestricted. If information contains
personal data, privacy classifications may also be applied.
13.2.3 Information minimization
For each category and classification, IPO should exercise caution to minimize the information to be distributed.
The minimization is necessary to prevent information overload at the receiving end, to ensure efficient use
of the sharing system, without compromising effectiveness. Another objective of the minimization is omitting
sensitive information to preserve the privacy of people in IPO and IRO. In this regards, IPO and IRO should
determine the desired level of details, wherever possible, for each category and classification of information
that can be identified prior to the actual sharing.
13.2.4 Limited audience
In line with the minimization principle, a policy to limit the audience, which may be to a specific contact person,
group, or organization, for distribution is necessary when sharing information containing private or confidential
data. For less sensitive information, such a policy should be considered to prevent information overload, unless
the benefits of maximum distribution (such as the sharing of critical security alerts) outweigh the impact of
information overload for the IRO.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

13.2.5 Coordination protocol
A high-level policy for coordinating the request and distribution (whether it is IPO or IRO initiated) should be
established. Such a policy formalizes the protocol involved, which provides a means for the IPO and IRO
to respond effectively and efficiently. Mutual authentication and verification procedures could then be built
upon such a protocol to ensure the authenticity of origin and proof of delivery where desired, in particular, for
sensitive, personal, and/or confidential information.

13.3 Methods and processes
13.3.1 Overview
To effect the information sharing policies, and ensure consistency of practice, effectiveness, efficiency, and
reliability of execution, related methods and processes should be developed and implemented. Such methods
and processes should be based on available standards. Otherwise, upon operational validation, they may be
formalized for standardization. The following clauses provide guidance on the methods and processes that are
commonly used by organizations in the industry for achieving relevant objectives and policies of information
sharing and coordination in the context of Cybersecurity.
13.3.2 Classification and categorization of information
Information to be shared will come from both open and closed sources. Open source information is often to be
found on the internet or from other public sources, such as newspapers. Open source information is generally
of the lowest classification because the originators of the information can be multiple or unknown, the age of
the information can be undetermined and the accuracy subject to question. Closed source information is not
publicly available, often attributable to a source and of known age. Examples of closed source information are
proprietary research and analytics, or empirically gathered intelligence.
NOTE the guidance for this clause may be based on the outcome of the Study Period on this topic, referencing the standard if
the SP proceeds to development, or adopting a summary of the text from the SP if it terminates without further development.

13.3.3 Non-disclosure agreement
An NDA may be used for at least two purposes in the context of information sharing and coordination for
improving Cybersecurity. A typical use of an NDA is to ensure adequate handling and protection of sensitive,
personal, and/or confidential information shared among IPO and IRO, and pre-establishing the condition of
sharing and further distribution and use of such information.
In the context of responding to Cybersecurity events, the pre-establishment of an NDA enables swift sharing
and distribution amongst authorized entities to take place efficiently even if the information classification has
not been clearly defined.
13.3.4 Code of practice
One commonly used method to ensure adequate sharing and handling of sensitive information is the
establishment of a code of practice, covering detailed procedures, responsibilities, and commitments from
stakeholder organizations (i.e., IPO and IRO) for responses and actions to be taken by respective entities
involved for each category and classification of information.
EXAMPLE
See the future International Standard ISO/IEC 29147, Information technology – Security techniques –
Vulnerability disclosure.

13.3.5 Testing and drills
To ensure effectiveness and reliability and to achieve the desired level of efficiency, methods and processes
should be developed for conducting regular testing and exercising scenario drills.
A standard methodology should be used as a reference for security testing, in order to fit it down and match
with the organization’s goals
and needs.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

Security tests can be performed on high risk assets. This can be assisted by using the organization’s own data
classification nomenclature.
Security assessments should be performed on a regular basis on the:
—

Application

—

Operating System

—

Database Management System

13.3.6 Timing and scheduling of information sharing
The requirement to share information either proactively or during an incident response will vary from entity
to entity. Some organizations will have a requirement for real-time information: the moment an alert or alarm
occurs they will want the intelligence for further analysis. Other entities will not possess the resources to
manage real-time information sharing. In fact, many organizations may not have the ability to manage schedule
information sharing on any interval.
Information sharing timing and schedules should be defined clearly, with specific service level objectives
defined for voluntary relationships and service level agreements for commercial relationships.

13.4 People and organizations
13.4.1 Overview
People and organizations are the key determinants to the success of Cybersecurity. People refer to individuals
involved in executing the methods and processes for information sharing and coordinating to make a positive
difference to the outcomes of Cybersecurity events. Organizations refer to groups of people within a company
up to entire company involved in such activities. For effectiveness and efficiency, the needs of both people and
organizations should to be considered.
13.4.2 Contacts
A list of contacts should be compiled by the IPO and IRO and mutually exchanged so that each entity can
identify the person who requested or sent information on the sharing community.
More granular contact lists may also be developed and shared in accordance with a limited audience (clause
13.2.4) and information classification and categorization (clause 13.2.2) policies.
The contact list should not contain sensitive personal information, in accordance with the information
minimization policy (clause 13.2.3). For privacy purposes, an alias may also be considered in place of full
name. The minimum information for the contact list should include name (or alias), contactable numbers
(mobile phone if possible), and email address. An alternative contact may also be established for each key
person in the contact list.
In addition to a contact list for information sharing and coordination, a separate contact list for incident escalation
may also be compiled to facilitate swift escalation. Such a list usually includes external contacts that are not in
the sharing network. For example, see Annex B.
At the minimum, the contact list should be protected against unauthorized modification to prevent corruption
and maintain integrity. Technical controls (clause 13.5) should be applied as appropriate.
13.4.3 Alliances
To facilitate information sharing, and establish common and consistent practices governed by an agreed code
of practice, and/or NDA, organizations and groups of individuals may form alliances based on their areas of
interest, which may be industry, technology, or other special interest areas. See Annex B for a sample list of
existing alliances and non-profit organizations that serve such a purpose.

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

13.4.4 Awareness and training
People in organizations should be made aware of emerging and new Cybersecurity risks and trained so that
they develop the required skills and expertise to respond effectively and efficiently when they encounter specific
risk involved, or received information requiring their actions to mitigate or improve a given situation. To achieve
these objectives,
—

Regular briefings on Cybersecurity risk status and findings concerning the organization and the industry
should be provided.

—

Focused training sessions Table Top simulated cyber-attack scenarios and workshops on specific required
areas of action should be designed, organized, and delivered, to both new comers to the group/organization,
with updates on a regular basis.

—

Regular testing, with walkthroughs of relevant scenarios to ensure comprehensive understanding and
ability to execute procedures and specific tools.

This awareness, training and testing may be performed by internal experts involved, external consultants, or
other experts from members of the related alliances involved in the information sharing and coordination efforts.
The use of scenarios as part of the training and testing processes is strongly recommended as such an
approach enables individuals to gain near real-life experience of relevant situations and learn and practice the
responses required. In addition, past incidents may be used as part of the scenarios to maximize sharing of
lessons learnt and understanding gained from those situations.

13.5 Technical
13.5.1 Overview
Technical controls and standardization may be used to improve efficiency, reduce human error, and enhance
security involved in the information sharing and coordination processes. A number of technical systems and
solutions may be designed, developed and implemented. This International Standard provides some of the
commonly used approaches and techniques that have been adopted by some organizations, and may be
further adapted for improving the information sharing and coordination needs and processes to deal with the
changing Cybersecurity risk environment.
13.5.2 Data standardization for automated system
As part of the sharing network, automated systems may be developed and deployed amongst coordinating
organizations to collect data on evolving Cybersecurity events for real-time and offline analysis and assessment,
in order to determine the latest security status in the Cyberspace within the boundary of the organizations
involved. Such data may include network traffic data, security updates for software systems and hardware
devices, security vulnerabilities data, and malware, spam, and spyware data, including their payloads and
intercepted information. Automated systems supporting the first responders and incident escalation, as
described in clause 13.4.2, would also contain data relating to organizations and people. In view of the sensitivity
and volume of the contents of the data involved in these systems, organizations (in particular, alliances of
organizations) should evaluate the data schemas and contents to determine suitable technical controls for
improving efficiency, effectiveness, and security. These can include, but are not limited to the following:
a)

standardization of the data schema for each category and classification of data collected enforcing the
information minimization and privacy policy, and providing technical assurance to all participating entities,
and data owners of such a practice;

b)

standardization of data format to ease sharing and improve storage, transmission, handling and
interoperability between systems. For example, see ITU-T X.1205; and

c)

standardization of basic data processing functionality and algorithms used, for example, hash function and
procedures for IP address anonymization and other pre-processing requirements.

13.5.3 Data visualization
Consider using data visualization techniques to present events information, which helps to improve visibility of
changes and the emerging security incident taking place without the need for the operators to read the details
of each event as it emerges. For example, see Annex A, which presents a visual representation of Darknet
activities, which facilitates a more efficient response to the changes.
13.5.4 Cryptographic key exchange and software/hardware backups
To facilitate sharing of confidential information, a cryptographic system, including a system for key exchange
that could be quickly deployed should be considered for implementation. The system should include adequate
backups for the software and hardware, as well as the keys used in preparation for the sharing purposes and
emergency recovery needs.
13.5.5 Secure file sharing, instant messaging, web portal, and discussion forum
To facilitate online interaction and quick and secure information sharing, which may include sharing of digital
contents such as text and multimedia files, and both online and offline discussions, the sharing organizations
(IPO and IRO) should consider adopting suitable file sharing tools, instant messenger, and online discussion
forum tools that could meet the security, effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability needs.
Web portal provision feeds on Cybersecurity events and status should be implemented as a form of
communication for both public and private community interested and involved, respectively. Where such a
web portal is used, there should be clear administrative ownership and responsibility to ensure its security and
availability, and private areas should be provided for limited audience information where necessary.
13.5.6 Testing systems
While each technical system and related methods and processes should be tested rigorously to ensure their
reliability and integrity, one or more technical systems dedicated for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of
testing, in particular, scenarios testing, should be considered. Such a system may be in the form of a simulation
system to simulate the operating environments as perceived by each organization of the Cyberspace, and
evolving Cybersecurity situation, providing the capability for introducing a series of security events to facilitate
required test to be performed.

13.6 Implementation guidance
The implementation of such a framework requires collaborating organizations and individuals to get together
(virtually or physically) to determine specific policy, controls and steps to take in order to achieve its objectives
of secure, effective, reliable, and efficient information sharing and coordination in response to emerging
Cybersecurity incidents. The following high-level steps are recommended as a guide for the implementation:
a)

Identify and gather relevant organizations and individuals to form the required information sharing and
coordination network community, either informally or formally;

b)

Determine the role(s) of each organization/individual involved either as IPO, IRO, or both (clause 13.2.1).

c)

Establish the kind of information and coordination required that would be beneficial to the community;

d)

Perform information categorization and classification to determine if any sensitive and/or privacy information
are involved (clause 13.2.2);

e)

Establish policies and principles governing the community and the information involved (clause 13.2);

f)

Determine the methods and processes required for each category and classification of information involved
(clause 13.3);

g)

Determine performance requirements and criteria, and establish Code of Practice and sign NDA as
necessary (clauses 13.3.3 and 13.3.4);

Annex A
(informative)
Cybersecurity readiness

A.1

Overview

The Cybersecurity controls described in clause 12 minimize organizations and end-users’ exposure and risk to
most of the known Cybersecurity attacks. Upon the emergence of Cybersecurity incidents, the framework for
information sharing and coordination described in clause 11 provides for establishing a system for information
sharing and coordination in preparation for responding to Cybersecurity events and incidents. Such information
is adequately protected between the IPO and IRO.
While these controls reduce risk and improve incident handling and management, cyber criminals or other
miscreants will continue to develop new or evolve current attacks to overcome existing protections. It is therefore
also important for organizations to implement systems and infrastructures that enable a more dynamic and
rigorous approach to security attack detection, investigation and response.
ISO/IEC 27031 provides guidance on management systems and related processes to prepare an organization’s
ICT systems to detect and respond to emerging security events, including Cybersecurity events. This guideline
highlights additional technical approaches that are applicable for improving an organization’s Cybersecurity
readiness in the area of event detection, through Darknet Monitoring, investigation, through Traceback, and
response, through Sinkhole Operation.
Organizations, in particular CIIPs should consider leveraging these approaches to improve their Cybersecurity
readiness and therefore status.

A.2
A.2.1

Darknet monitoring
Introduction

The Darknet is a set of IP addresses that are not used in organizations. IP addresses in Darknet are not assigned
to any operational servers/PC systems. By using monitored packets in the Darknet IP domains, organizations
could observe emerging network attacks, including malware-initiated network scanning, malware infection
behaviour and DDoS Backscatters. Since IP addresses of the Darknet are public, but are not assigned to
legitimate hosts, all incoming traffic belonging to Darknet IP domains can be inferred as a consequence of
either malicious activities, or that of incorrect configurations.
There are, in general, three methods commonly used in Darknet to observe malicious activities related traffics
on the Internet, namely, Black Hole Monitoring, and Low and High Interaction Monitoring.

A.2.2

Black hole monitoring

Black Hole monitoring refers to monitoring systems which do not respond to anything against incoming packets
found within the Darknet IP domains. This type of monitoring system is often used to quietly observe network
ports scanning by malware, and malware infection behaviour (UDP with payload including shell code) and
DDoS Backscatters. Network port scanning is often the initial step taken by attackers to search for vulnerable
host systems that can be exploited. The malware infection behaviours are normally the follow-up steps taken
by the attackers after identifying the vulnerable host systems. Such infection actions are often observed to use
UDP with payload on the black hole monitoring. Furthermore, DDoS Backscatters are also observed by means
of Black Hole monitoring in the case of spoofing source IP addresses (attackers) and the target of DDoS can
be recognized by this Backscatters traffic. Figure A.1 depicts a screen capture of a visualization of the malware
activities detected by a Black Hole monitoring system. A sample video link can be found here: https://www.
youtube.com/watch?v=asemvKgkib4&feature=related.

Figure A.1 — Example of a visualization of malware activities using a Black Hole monitoring system
The “arrows” above the world map (Figure A.1) depicts the traversal of IP packets from sources to the targeted
locations. The different shades (colours in the video) depict the type of packet (e.g., TCP SYN, TCP SYN-ACK,
other types of TCP, UDP, and ICMP). The altitude of each arrow is in proportion to its port number.

A.2.3

Low interaction monitoring

A low interaction monitoring system is a Darknet monitoring system that responds to detected Darknet IP packets
by attempting to connect back to the suspicious host systems. The purpose of the attempted connection is to
obtain more information regarding the attacking host systems, the attack network paths used, and other related
attack information, if possible. The monitoring system is often configured to disguise itself as a system with unfixed
vulnerabilities to attract attacks. Low interaction monitoring system is also used to observe further reaction of
malicious behaviour and activities such as the execution of Shell Scripts after the initial network port scans.

A.2.4

High interaction monitoring

A high interaction monitoring system (also referred to as a high interaction honeypot) is also a Darknet monitoring
system that responds to detected Darknet IP packets by attempting to connect back to the suspicious host
systems and to interact with the systems as much as possible. The purpose of the interaction is to obtain
much deeper information including the strategy of exploiting vulnerabilities, malware executables injected
after exploitations, and the behaviour of the infecting malware. The high interaction monitoring system can be
implemented on real or virtual operation systems with unfixed vulnerabilities so that they draw attentions from
attackers, get exploited, and finally capture injected malware samples.

A.3

Sinkhole operation

A Sinkhole operation is defined as a method to redirect specific IP traffic to a sinkhole device (e.g., sinkhole
router) for the purpose of traffic analysis, diversion of attacks, and detection of anomalous behaviours on a
network. For example, if business operation of a target system is disrupted by means of a DDoS attack, one
of the effective solutions is to initiate a Sinkhole operation by injecting an alternative route for the target and
redirecting the DDoS traffic along the route instead of allowing it to flow downstream to the original target. The
sinkhole device is capable of absorbing, analysing and/or discarding the DDoS traffic. The redirect route of the
target, which is heading to a sinkhole router, is usually released by a BGP border router. The Sinkhole operation

﻿

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

by use of the BGP configuration is described in RFC 3882. A disadvantage of this method is that the IP address
being attacked cannot be used for communication with other network users until the route is removed.
The Sinkhole operations are often used for the protection against DDoS attacks as described above. It has
also been deployed to protect against botnet attacks by redirecting botnet Command and Control (C&C) to a
sinkhole device. Since every bot needs to establish connections with a C&C server in order to receive attack
instructions form a botnet controller, they send DNS queries for resolving the URL of the C&C server. Then
DNS servers send an IP address of the sinkhole device to the bots instead of the genuine IP address of the
C&C server. Consequently, the botnet controller is deprived of the connection with the bots so as not to send
attack instructions to them.

A.4

Traceback

In order to automate or expedite the manual tracking against malicious attacks such as DoS attacks where the
originating host is falsified, many automatic traceback techniques have been studied. Traceback techniques
are recognized as techniques that reconstruct the attack path, and locate the attacker nodes by correcting the
attack traffic, routing information, marked packets, or audit log of the attack traffic.
No traceback techniques, which can reconstruct the attack path across several network domains, are employed
or practiced in the real network operating environment yet. The difficulties of deploying inter-domain (across
several network domains) traceback techniques are derived from the following operational issues:
a)

For the purpose of inter-domain traceback, exchanging sensitive information such as detailed backbone
topology can cause serious problems for network operators.

b)

Since traceback operation can be closely tied to ISP backbone network security, arbitrary trials of
traceback attempts by unauthorized people would not be acceptable to most ISPs. Therefore, there is a
fear of misuse of the traceback technique on each network domain by others.

c)

If a single and specific inter-domain traceback technique is applied across several network domains,
the unique single technique should be deployed by participating Autonomous Systems (AS) at the same
time. Furthermore, attackers will sooner or later develop evasion attacks. Practically speaking, many ISPs
employ multiple detection and traceback tools in their networks.

The above operational issues arise when a trial of traceback attempts to expand beyond the network
boundaries. Traceback techniques should consider the boundaries of network operation and the difference of
the operational policies among different network domains. It is firmly believed that inter-domain traceback and
attack mitigation mechanisms need to be deployed ubiquitously across the Internet.
In the development of inter-domain traceback techniques and systems in practice, the following traceback
architecture should be considered:
a)

For keeping the network operation boundaries, the traceback architecture must leave each AS to decide
to inherit a request of tracking by each AS’ operational policy;

b)

The traceback architecture also should leave each AS to decide whether or not to investigate the inside of
its own network domain more deeply;

c)

The architecture should also allow each sub-domain of an AS to decide whether or not to inspect each
sub-domain’s network by its operation policy. The operation of traceback will consume many resources on
the related ASes; therefore, the traceback architecture should not generate or flood meaningless requests
if possible; therefore, the traceback architecture should not forward request messages to ASes which have
no relation to the mounted attack;

d)

In order to reduce the damage of misuses, the message should not convey such sensitive information that
might cause the leakage of secrets or confidence of an AS; thus, the traceback architecture should not
reveal sensitive information of an AS to others;

e)

Even when a misuse or a compromised action occurred, the traceability of the message will identify the
offender, hence, a message exchanged in the architecture should have its own traceability to prove or to
Licensed to Mr. PEDDINTI
confirm the issuers;

﻿

ISO/IEC 27032:2012(E)

f)

If the architecture depends on one specific traceback technique, attackers will develop evasion attacks
and hide the location of the attacker nodes. To overcome evasion attacks, the traceback architecture
should be independent from specific traceback techniques;

g)

Many operation systems come to support the IPv4/IPv6 dual stack, and several attacks come through
a 6to4 IPv6 tunnelling. If the traceback architecture cannot track back attacks on the IPv6 network or
attacks through some translators, the majority of attacks will shift to such a complex attack. Therefore,
the traceback architecture should track back an attack on a dual stack environment, even when the attack
employs some address translation techniques;

h)

To automate the process of attack mitigation, the architecture should be able to export the result of a
traceback trial as a trigger of the attack mitigation. Therefore, the traceback architecture should allow each
AS to take another action along with a tracking result such as a filtering or another tracking;

i)

The architecture should have the capability to cooperate with detection systems or protection systems;

j)

An attacker can change the pattern of attack traffic to avoid the effect of such mitigating actions. Combating
with changes of a complex attack, the time spent to trace an attack path should be as short as possible.
Therefore, the architecture should exclude human beings as much as possible.

Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27033-1 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.
This first edition of ISO/IEC 27033-1 cancels and replaces ISO/IEC 18028-1:2006.
ISO/IEC 27033 consists of the following parts, under the general title Information technology — Security
techniques ― IT network security:
⎯

Part 1: Guidelines for network security

The following parts are under preparation:
⎯

Part 2: Guidelines for the design and implementation of network security

⎯

Part 3: Reference networking scenarios — Risks, design techniques and control issues

Risks, design techniques and control issues for
⎯

securing communications between networks using security gateways,

⎯

securing virtual private networks,

⎯

IP convergence, and

⎯

wireless networks

will form the subject of future parts.

Introduction
In today’s world, the majority of both commercial and government organizations have their information
systems connected by networks (see Figure 1), with the network connections being one or more of the
following:
⎯

within the organization,

⎯

between different organizations,

⎯

between the organization and the general public.

Further, with the rapid developments in publicly available network technology (in particular with the Internet)
offering significant business opportunities, organizations are increasingly conducting electronic business on a
global scale and providing online public services. The opportunities include the provision of lower cost data
communications, using the Internet simply as a global connection medium, through to more sophisticated
services provided by Internet service providers (ISPs). This can mean the use of relatively low cost local
attachment points at each end of a circuit to full scale online electronic trading and service delivery systems,
using web-based applications and services. Additionally, the new technology (including the integration of data,

voice and video) increases the opportunities for remote working (also known as “teleworking” or
“telecommuting”) that enable personnel to operate away from their home work base for significant periods of
time. They are able to keep in contact through the use of remote facilities to access organization and
community networks and related business support information and services.
However, whilst this environment does facilitate significant business benefits, there are new security risks to
be managed. With organizations relying heavily on the use of information and associated networks to conduct
their business, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and services could have
significant adverse impacts on business operations. Thus, there is a major requirement to properly protect
networks and their related information systems and information. In other words: implementing and maintaining
adequate network security is absolutely critical to the success of any organization’s business operations.
In this context, the telecommunications and information technology industries are seeking cost-effective
comprehensive security solutions, aimed at protecting networks against malicious attacks and inadvertent
incorrect actions, and meeting the business requirements for confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information and services. Securing a network is also essential for maintaining the accuracy of billing or usage
information as appropriate. Security capabilities in products are crucial to overall network security (including
applications and services). However, as more products are combined to provide total solutions, the
interoperability, or the lack thereof, will define the success of the solution. Security must not only be a thread
of concern for each product or service, but must be developed in a manner that promotes the interweaving of
security capabilities in the overall security solution.
The purpose of ISO/IEC 27033 is to provide detailed guidance on the security aspects of the management,
operation and use of information system networks, and their inter-connections. Those individuals within an
organization that are responsible for information security in general, and network security in particular, should
be able to adapt the material in this International Standard to meet their specific requirements. Its main
objectives are as follows.
⎯

ISO/IEC 27033-1, Overview and concepts, to define and describe the concepts associated with, and
provide management guidance on, network security. This includes the provision of an overview of
network security and related definitions, and guidance on how to identify and analyze network security
risks and then define network security requirements. It also introduces how to achieve good quality
technical security architectures, and the risk, design and control aspects associated with typical network
scenarios and network “technology” areas (which are dealt with in detail in subsequent parts of
ISO/IEC 27033).

⎯

ISO/IEC 27033-2, Guidelines for the design and implementation of network security, to define how
organizations should achieve quality network technical security architectures, designs and
implementations that will ensure network security appropriate to their business environments, using a
consistent approach to the planning, design and implementation of network security, as relevant, aided by
the use of models/frameworks (in this context, a model/framework is used to outline a representation or
description showing the structure and high level workings of a type of technical security
architecture/design), and is relevant to all personnel who are involved in the planning, design and
implementation of the architectural aspects of network security (for example network architects and
designers, network managers, and network security officers).

⎯

ISO/IEC 27033-3, Risks, design techniques and control issues for reference network scenarios, to define
the specific risks, design techniques and control issues associated with typical network scenarios. It is
relevant to all personnel who are involved in the planning, design and implementation of the architectural
aspects of network security (for example network architects and designers, network managers, and
network security officers).

It is proposed that future parts of ISO/IEC 27033 will address the following topics.
⎯

ISO/IEC 27033-4, Risks, design techniques and control issues for securing communications between
networks using security gateways, to define the specific risks, design techniques and control issues for
securing information flows between networks using security gateways. It will be relevant to all personnel
who are involved in the detailed planning, design and implementation of security gateways (for example
network architects and designers, network managers, and network security officers).

⎯

SO/IEC 27033-5, Risks, design techniques and control issues for securing virtual private networks, to
define the specific risks, design techniques and control issues for securing connections that are
established using virtual private networks (VPNs). It will be relevant to all personnel who are involved in
the detailed planning, design and implementation of VPN security (for example network architects and
designers, network managers, and network security officers).

⎯

ISO/IEC 27033-6, IP convergence, to define the specific risks, design techniques and control issues for
securing IP convergence networks, i.e. those with the convergence of data, voice and video. It will be
relevant to all personnel who are involved in the detailed planning, design and implementation of security
for IP convergence networks (for example network architects and designers, network managers, and
network security officers).

⎯

ISO/IEC 27033-7, Wireless, to define the specific risks, design techniques and control issues for securing
wireless and radio networks. It will be relevant to all personnel who are involved in the detailed planning,
design and implementation of security for wireless and radio networks (for example network architects
and designers, network managers, and network security officers).

It is emphasized that ISOI/IEC 27033 provides further detailed implementation guidance on the network
security controls that are described at a basic standardized level in ISO/IEC 27002.
If there are other parts in the future, these will be relevant to all personnel who are involved in the detailed
planning, design and implementation of the network aspects covered by those parts (for example network
architects and designers, network managers, and network security officers).
It should be noted that this International Standard is not a reference or normative document for regulatory and
legislative security requirements. Although it emphasizes the importance of these influences, it cannot state
them specifically, since they are dependent on the country, the type of business, etc.
Unless otherwise stated, throughout this part of ISO/IEC 27033 the guidance referenced is applicable to
current and/or planned networks, but will only be referenced as “networks” or “the network”.

Part 1:
Overview and concepts

1

Scope

This part of ISO/IEC 27033 provides an overview of network security and related definitions. It defines and
describes the concepts associated with, and provides management guidance on, network security. (Network
security applies to the security of devices, security of management activities related to the devices,
applications/services, and end-users, in addition to security of the information being transferred across the
communication links.)
It is relevant to anyone involved in owning, operating or using a network. This includes senior managers and
other non-technical managers or users, in addition to managers and administrators who have specific
responsibilities for information security and/or network security, network operation, or who are responsible for
an organization’s overall security program and security policy development. It is also relevant to anyone
involved in the planning, design and implementation of the architectural aspects of network security.
This part of ISO/IEC 27033 also
⎯

provides guidance on how to identify and analyse network security risks and the definition of network
security requirements based on that analysis,

⎯

provides an overview of the controls that support network technical security architectures and related
technical controls, as well as those non-technical controls and technical controls that are applicable not
just to networks,

⎯

introduces how to achieve good quality network technical security architectures, and the risk, design and
control aspects associated with typical network scenarios and network “technology” areas (which are
dealt with in detail in subsequent parts of ISO/IEC 27033), and

⎯

briefly addresses the issues associated with implementing and operating network security controls, and
the on-going monitoring and reviewing of their implementation.

Overall, it provides an overview of the ISO/IEC 27033 series and a “road map” to all other parts.

3.6
certification authority
CA
authority trusted by one or more users to create and assign public-key certificates
NOTE 1

Optionally, the certification authority can create the users' keys.

NOTE 2
The role of the certification authority (CA) in this process is to guarantee that the individual granted the unique
certificate is, in fact, who he or she claims to be. Usually, this means that the CA has an arrangement with an institution
which provides it with information to confirm an individual's claimed identity. CAs are a critical component in information
security and electronic commerce because they guarantee that the two parties exchanging information are really who they
claim to be.

3.7
corporate information security policy
document that describes management direction and support for information security in accordance with
business requirements and relevant laws and regulations
NOTE
The document describes the high level information security requirements that have to be followed throughout
the organization.

DMZ
perimeter network (also known as a screened sub-net) inserted as a “neutral zone” between networks
3.9
denial of service
DoS
prevention of authorized access to a system resource or the delaying of system operations and functions, with
resultant loss of availability to authorized users
3.10
extranet
extension of an organization's Intranet, especially over the public network infrastructure, enabling resource
sharing between the organization and other organizations and individuals that it deals with by providing limited
access to its Intranet
NOTE
For example, an organization's customers can be provided access to some part of its Intranet, creating an
extranet, but the customers cannot be considered “trusted” from a security standpoint.

3.11
filtering
process of accepting or rejecting data flows through a network, according to specified criteria
3.12
firewall
type of security barrier placed between network environments — consisting of a dedicated device or a
composite of several components and techniques — through which all traffic from one network environment
traverses to another, and vice versa, and only authorized traffic, as defined by the local security policy, is
allowed to pass
3.13
hub
network device that functions at layer 1 of the OSI reference model
NOTE
There is no real intelligence in network hubs; they only provide physical attachment points for networked
systems or resources.

Structure

The structure of the ISOI/IEC 27033 series of standards is shown in diagrammatic, or ‘road map’, form in
Figure 2 below.
It is noted that in Figure 2 the solid lines indicate the natural hierarchy of the Parts of ISO/IEC 27033. The
dotted lines indicate that in following the processes described in (a) Part 1 – Parts 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 may be
consulted for information on security risks, and (b) Part 2 - Parts 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 may be consulted for
information on design techniques and control issues. Further, there are references in Part 3 to particular
aspects covered in Parts 4, 5, 6 and 7 to avoid duplication (i.e. in using Part 3 there may be a need to consult
Parts 4, 5, 6 and 7).
Thus, for any organization starting from ‘scratch’, or conducting a major review of existing network(s), it should
first use the content of Part 1 and then Part 2, but consulting as necessary and appropriate the information on
security risks, design techniques and control issues contained in Parts 3 to 7.
For example, an organization is considering the implementation of a new network environment that includes
use of IP convergence, security gateways and some use of wireless, as well as use of web hosting and the
Internet (e.g. for e-mail and outgoing online access).
In using the processes described in Part 1 to determine the security risks to the new network environment, the
organization would consult the risk related information from the other relevant Parts of ISO/IEC 27033, i.e.
those Parts that define the specific security risks (as well as design techniques and control issues) relating to
IP convergence, security gateways and some use of wireless, as well as use of web hosting and the Internet
(e.g. for e-mail and online access).
In using Part 2 to determine the network technical security architecture required, the organization would
consult the information on design techniques and control issues from the other relevant Parts of
ISO/IEC 27033, i.e. those that define the specific design techniques and control issues (as well as the security
risks) - relating to IP convergence, security gateways and some use of wireless, as well as use of web hosting
and the Internet (e.g. for e-mail and online access).

Figure 3 ― Example Network Environment
The Intranet specifies the network an organization relies on and maintains internally. Typically, only persons
working for the organization have direct physical access to this network, and since the network is located
within premises owned by the organization, a level of physical protection could easily be achieved. In most
cases the Intranet is not homogenous with regard to the technologies used and security requirements; there
can be infrastructures which have a need for a higher protection level than given by the Intranet itself. Such
infrastructures, for example the essential parts of a PKI environment, can be operated in a dedicated segment

of the Intranet. On the other hand, certain technologies (e.g. WLAN infrastructures) can require some isolation
and authentication because they introduce additional risks. For both cases, internal security gateways can be
used to implement this segmentation.
The business needs of the majority of organizations today necessitate communications and data exchange
with external partners and other organizations. Often the most important business partners are connected in a
way directly extending the Intranet towards the network of the partner organization; the term Extranet is
commonly used for such extensions. Since trust in the connected partner organizations is in most cases lower
than within the organization, extranet security gateways are used to cover the risks introduced with these
connections.
Public networks, of which the Internet is the most common example, are further used today to provide cost
optimized communications and data exchange facilities with partners, customers and the general public, and
to provide various forms of extensions of the Intranet. Due to the low trust level in public networks, especially
the Internet, sophisticated security gateways are needed to help manage the associated risks. These security
gateways include specific components to address the requirements of the various forms of Intranet extension
as well as partner and customer connections.
Remote users can be connected through VPN technology, and they may further use wireless connection
facilities like public WLAN hotspots for accessing the Internet. Alternatively, remote users can use the
telephone network for establishing direct dial-up connections to a Remote Access Server, which is often
located within the DMZ environment of the Internet Firewall.
When an organization decides to use VoIP technologies to implement the internal telephone network, then
appropriate security gateways to the phone network are typically present as well.
Business opportunities afforded by new network environments should be balanced against the risks posed by
the newer technologies. For example, the Internet has a number of technical features which can cause
concerns from a security point of view, as it was originally designed with resilience rather than security as a
priority – and many of the underlying protocols in common use are not naturally secure. There are a large
number of people in the global environment who have the capacity, knowledge and inclination to access the
underlying mechanisms and protocols and create security incidents, ranging from unauthorized access to fullscale destructive denial of service.

6.2

Network Security Planning and Management

When considering network connections, all those persons in the organization who have responsibilities
associated with the connections should be clear about the business requirements and benefits, the related
security risks, and the related technical security architectural aspects/design techniques and security control
areas. The business requirements and benefits will influence many decisions and actions taken in the process
of considering network connections, identifying technical security architectural aspects/design techniques and
potential security control areas, and then eventually selecting, designing, implementing and maintaining
secure networks.
The overall process for achieving and maintaining required network security can be summarized as follows:
a)

determine scope/context and then assess security risks:
1)

gather information on the current and/or planned network environment:
i)

review the corporate information security policy for statements on network related risks that will
always be considered as high, and on network security controls that will need to be implemented
regardless of the assessed risks.
NOTE
This policy should also contain the organization’s position on (1) regulatory and legislative
security requirements relating to network connections as defined by the relevant regulatory or legislative
bodies (including national government agencies), and (2) the sensitivity of the data to be stored or
transported on the network.

ii)

gather and review information on the current and/or planned network(s) – the architecture(s),
applications, services, types of connection and other characteristics – this will have a bearing on
the identification and assessment of risks, and determining what is possible in terms of network
technical security architecture/design,

iii)

gather other information to be able to assess potential adverse business impacts, threats and
vulnerabilities (this will include the value to business operations of the information to be
transferred via network connections, any other information potentially accessible in an
unauthorized way through these connections, and of the services provided),

identify and assess the network security risks, and appropriate potential control areas:
i)

conduct network security risk assessment and management review including using risk
information related to required network scenarios and ‘technology’ topics (see clauses 10
and 11) – security requirements definition. (Note that this will include (1) assessment of the risks
associated with potential breaches of relevant regulation and legislation relating to network
connections as defined by the relevant regulatory or legislative bodies (including national
government agencies), and (2) using the agreed potential adverse business impacts, confirming
the sensitivity/classification of the data to be stored or transported on the network),

b)

identify supporting security controls – non-technical and technical that not only apply to networks (see
clause 8),

c)

review technical security architecture/design options, considering network scenarios and ‘technology’
topics, and selecting and documenting the preferred technical security architecture/design and related
security controls (see clauses 9 to 11, and Annex A). [Note that this will include controls required to
comply with relevant regulations and legislation relating to network connections as defined by the relevant
regulatory or legislative bodies (including national government agencies)],

d)

develop and test the security solution (see clause 12),

e)

implement and operate the security controls (see clause 13),

f)

monitor and review the implementation (see clause 14). (Note that this will include monitoring and
reviewing the controls required to comply with relevant regulations and legislation relating to network
connections as defined by the relevant regulatory or legislative bodies (including national government
agencies):
1)

reviews should be carried out periodically, and in the case of major changes (in business needs,
technology, security solutions, etc.), and as necessary the results from the earlier stages outlined
above should be re-visited and updated.

Identifying Risks and Preparing to Identify Security Controls
Introduction

As reflected in clause 6 above, the first stage in identifying and assessing network related risks and preparing
to identify security controls is to gather information on the current and/or planned network environment.
Clause 7.2 below provides guidance on this. The next stage is to identify and assess the network security
risks, and appropriate potential control areas. Clause 7.3 below provides guidance on this.

Information on Current and/or Planned Networking

7.2.1

Security Requirements in Corporate Information Security Policy

An organization (or community)’s corporate information security policy can include statements on the need for
confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation and availability, as well as views on types of threat and risk, and
network security controls that will need to be implemented regardless of the assessed risks. Thus the first step
should be to review the corporate information security policy for details of any network related risks that will
always be considered as high and of network security controls that must be implemented.
For example, such a policy could state that
•

the availability of certain types of information or services is a major concern,

•

no connections via dial-up lines are permitted,

•

all connections to the Internet should be made through a security gateway,

•

a particular type of security gateway should be used,

•

no payment instruction is valid without a digital signature.

Such requirements should be accounted for in the conduct of the risk assessment and management review,
and the identification of the technical security architectural/design aspects and potential security controls. Any
such requirements should be documented in the draft list of potential control areas, and as necessary
reflected in the technical security architecture/design options.
Guidance on information security policy is provided in ISO/IEC 27002 and ISO/IEC 27005.
7.2.2
7.2.2.1

Information on Current/Planned Networking
Introduction

The next step should be to gather and review information on the current and/or planned network(s) – the
architecture(s), applications, services, types of connection and other characteristics – this will have a bearing
on the identification and assessment of risks, and determining what is possible in terms of network technical
security architecture/design. These aspects are described below.
7.2.2.2

Network Architectures, Applications and Services

Detail should be obtained of the relevant current and/or planned network architecture, applications and
services, and reviewed to provide the necessary understanding and context for the conduct of the network
security risk assessment and management review and thence considering the network technical security
architecture options. By clarifying these aspects at the earliest possible stage, the process of identifying and
assessing the security risks and associated security controls, and the network technical security architecture
options and deciding which one should be adopted, should become more efficient and eventually result in a
more workable security solution.
Further, the consideration of the current and/or planned network architecture, application and service aspects
at an early stage should allow time for those aspects to be reviewed and possibly revised if an acceptable
security solution cannot be realistically achieved within the current and/or planned environment.
Depending on the area they cover, networks can be very broadly categorized as:
•

LANs, which are used to interconnect systems locally, and

•

WANs, which are used to interconnect systems up to a world-wide coverage.

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

(Some sources also define the term Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) for a locally restricted WAN, e.g. within
a city. However, nowadays the same technologies are used as for WANs and thus there are no significant
differences between MAN and WAN any more. Further, for the purposes of this standard Personal Area
Networks (PANs) will be categorized as LANs. Another term used today is Global Area Network (GAN), i.e. a
global WAN. Note that today there are terms used for storage related networks, such as Storage Area
Network (SAN) and Network Attached Storage (NAS), but these are not in the scope of IS 27033.)
Different protocols have different security characteristics and should be afforded special consideration. For
example:
•

shared media protocols are mainly used in LANs and provide mechanisms to regulate the use of shared
media among the systems connected. As a shared media is used, all information on the network is
physically accessible by all connected systems. An example here is Ethernet hub,

•

access control protocols that are designed to allow entry to a network. Examples here include
IEEE 802.1x and WPA,

•

routing protocols are used to define the route through the different nodes on which information travels
across network segments, either LANs or WANs. Information is physically accessible for all systems along
the route, and routing can be changed, either accidentally or intentionally,

•

MPLS protocols, on which many carrier networks are based, allows a carrier core network to be shared by
multiple private networks without any member of one private network being aware that there are other
private networks sharing the core network. The major application is the implementation of VPNs, where
different labels are used to identify and segregate traffic belonging to different VPNs (an MPLS based
VPN is not based on data encryption mechanisms). This enables corporate customers to outsource their
internal network to a service provider and thus avoid the need to deploy and manage their own core IP
network. A key benefit is the ability to converge network services, such as voice and data over one
network, using QoS mechanisms to ensure real time performance.

Many of the protocols used in networks do not implement any security. For example, tools to acquire
passwords from network traffic are commonly used by attackers. This makes protocols like Telnet that send
unencrypted passwords over a public network highly vulnerable.
NOTE

Telnet is Terminal emulation program to work on-line on a remote computer

Many protocols can be used in conjunction with different network topologies and media, and by using wired as
well as wireless technologies. In many cases this has further impact on the security characteristics.
The type of applications used over a network should be considered in the context of security. Types can
include:
•

thin client applications,

•

desktop applications,

•

terminal emulation based applications,

•

messaging infrastructures and applications,

•

store and forward or spooler based applications, and

•

client server applications.

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

The following examples show how application characteristics influence the security requirements for the
network environments they may use:
•

messaging applications (that provide encryption and digital signatures for messages) can provide an
adequate security level without the implementation of dedicated security controls on the network,

•

thin client applications may need to download mobile code for proper functionality. Whereas confidentiality
may not be a major issue in this context, integrity is important and the network should provide appropriate
mechanisms for this. Alternatively, if higher requirements need to be fulfilled, digital signing of mobile code
will provide integrity and additional authentication. Often this is done within an application framework itself,
and therefore there may be no need to provide these services in the network,

•

store and forward or spooler based applications typically temporarily store important data on intermediate
nodes for further processing. If there are integrity and confidentiality requirements, appropriate controls
will be needed in the network to protect the data in transit. However, due to the temporary storage of data
on intermediate hosts, these controls may not be sufficient. Thus, additional controls may need to be
applied to also protect data stored on intermediate nodes.

The type of services (e.g. DNS, e-mail, voice) used over a network should also be considered in the context of
security.
When reviewing the network architecture, applications and services, consideration should also be given to
existing network connections within, to or from the organization/community, and to the network to which a
connection is proposed. The organization/community’s existing connections can restrict or prevent new
connections, e.g. because of agreements or contracts. The existence of other connections to or from the
network to which a connection is required could introduce additional vulnerabilities and thus higher risks,
possibly warranting stronger and/or additional controls.
(General guidance on network and application architectures can be found in ISO/IEC 7498.)
7.2.2.3

Types of Network Connection

There are many generic types of network connection that an organization/community may need to utilize.
Some of these types of connection can be made through private networks (to which access is restricted to a
known community), and some could be made through public networks (to which access is potentially available
to any organization or person). Further, these types of network connection could be used for a variety of
services, e.g. electronic mail, and could involve use of Internet, Intranet or Extranet facilities, each with
differing security considerations. Each of the types of connection can have different vulnerabilities and thus
associated security risks, and consequently eventually require a different set of controls.
One way of categorizing the generic types of network connection that may be required to conduct business, is
as follows:
− interconnection between different parts of the same organization within the same controlled location, i.e. a
single controlled building or site,
− interconnection between different geographically disparate parts of the same organization, e.g. regional
offices with a headquarters site, across a wide area network. Most if not all users are able to access the
information systems available via the network, but not all users within the organization would have
authorization for access to all applications or information,
− connections between an organization site and personnel working in locations away from the organization,
or the establishment of remote links to an organization’s computing systems by employees working from
home or other remote sites not linked via a network maintained by the organization,
− connections between different organizations within a closed community, e.g. because of contractual or
other legally binding situations, or of similar business interests, e.g. banking or insurance. Such

− connections with other organizations, e.g. for access to remote databases held by other organizations. In
this type of network connection, all users, including those of the connecting organization, are individually
pre-authorized by the external organization whose information is being accessed.
− connections with the general public domain, with access initiated by the organization’s users to public
access databases, web sites, and/or electronic mail facilities (e.g. via the Internet),
− connections to the public telephone network from an IP environment, with access initiated to the PSTN
from a telephone in an IP network. Such connections are uncontrolled as calls could be received from any
location in the world.
Whatever means of categorization is used, the different types of connection in the current and/or planned
network environment should be reviewed for their security implications and the information obtained should be
used in the process of identifying and assessing the security risks and associated security controls, and the
network technical security architecture options and deciding which one should be adopted.
7.2.2.4

Other Network Characteristics

Other characteristics of the current and/or planned network(s) should be reviewed. It is particularly important
to identify whether the network used/to be used is a public network – a network accessible by anyone, or a
private network, e.g. a network consisting of owned or leased lines, therefore considered to be more secure
than a public network. It is also important to know the type of data transported by the network, for example a:
•

data network – a network transferring primarily data and making use of data protocols,

•

voice network – a network intended for telephone but also usable for data, or

•

‘hybrid’ network encompassing both data and voice, and possibly video.

Other information, such as:
•

whether the network is a packet, switched or MPLS network,

•

whether it supports a QoS, i.e. in an MPLS network. (QoS concerns consistent performance, reliability
and availability. Network services should be delivered to provide the minimum performance level to be
usable. For example, voice services will stutter and break up if the bandwidth is inadequate. QoS refers to
a network system’s ability to sustain a given service at or above its required minimum performance level.),

is also relevant.
Further, it should also be established whether a connection is permanent, or established at time of need.
Once these characteristics of the current and/or planned network have been identified, and at minimum it has
been established if the network is public or private, then it is worth considering the following for input into the
network security risk assessment and management review. Roughly categorize the network into something
like – network with:
•

an unknown community of users,

•

a known community of users and within a closed business community (of more than one organization),

•

a known community of users solely within the organization.

Then consider the category in the context of whether the network used/to be used is a public or private
network, and further categorize as:
− an unknown community of users, and use of a public network,
− a known community of users and within a closed business community, and use of a public network,

− a known community of users solely within the organization, and use of a public network,
− an unknown community of users and use of a private network,
− a known community of users and within a closed business community, and use of a private network,
− a known community of users solely within the organization, and use of a private network.
Whichever way this is reviewed, be aware that certain combinations are likely to mean lower levels of risk than
others. The information obtained should be used in the process of identifying and assessing the security risks
and associated security controls, and the network technical security architecture options and deciding which
one should be adopted.
7.2.2.5

Other Information

Finally, other information should be gathered to be properly prepared for the ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002
compatible network security risk assessment and management review, including to carefully define the review
boundary/scope. Doing this at the earliest opportunity will avoid later ambiguity, unnecessary work and will
improve the focus and effectiveness of the review. The boundary/scope definition should clearly indicate
which of the following have to be considered when carrying out the network security risk assessment and
management review:
− information types,
− business processes,
− actual or potential hardware components, software, services, connections, etc. details (if not known
specifically, in general terms),
− actual or potential environments (e.g. locations, facilities),
− activities (operations).
This information, along with that gathered in accordance with clause 7.2 above, should be used in the network
security risk assessment and management review, the activities of which are summarized in clause 7.3 below.

7.3

Information Security Risks and Potential Control Areas

As reflected earlier, the majority of organizations today are dependent on the use of networks and related
information systems and information to support their business operations. Further, in many cases there is a
definite business requirement for the use of networks between the information systems at each organization’s
location, and to other locations both within and outside the organization, including to/from the general public.
When a connection is made to another network, considerable care should be taken to ensure that the
connecting organization is not exposed to additional risks (from potential threats exploiting vulnerabilities).
These risks could, for example, result from the connection itself or from network connections at the other end.
Some of these risks can be related to ensuring adherence to relevant legislation and regulation. (Particular
attention should be given to privacy and data protection legislation. Several countries have legislation placing
controls on the collection, processing and transmission of personal data, i.e. data that can be related to a
specific person or persons. Depending on the respective national legislation, such controls can impose duties
on those collecting, processing and disseminating personal information through networks and can even
restrict the ability to transfer that data to certain other countries, yielding additional important security
concerns. Less obvious examples of data that can be subject to such legislation are some hardware and IP
addresses.)

Thus the risks faced could relate to concerns about unauthorized access to information, unauthorized sending
of information, the introduction of malicious code, denial of receipt or origin, denial of service connection, and
unavailability of information and service. These can relate to loss of:
•

confidentiality of information and code (in networks and in systems connected to networks),

•

integrity of information and code (in networks and in systems connected to networks),

•

availability of information and network services (and systems connected to networks),

•

non-repudiation of network transactions (commitments),

•

accountability of network transactions,

•

authenticity of information (as well of course of network users and administrators),

•

reliability of information and code (in networks and in systems connected to networks),

•

ability to control unauthorized use and exploitation of network resources, including in the contexts of
organization policy (e.g. selling bandwidth or using bandwidth for own benefits) and responsibilities in
relation to legislation and regulation (e.g. storing child pornography),

•

ability to control abuse of authorized access.

Thus, a network security risk assessment and management review should be conducted to identify and
confirm the technical security controls and technical security architecture/design aspects, and supporting nontechnical security controls, and in line with recognized good security practice, such as given in
ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27002 and ISO/IEC 27005. This involves five main activities:
− determining the measures of the importance of information and service, expressed in terms of the potential
adverse impacts on business operations were unwanted incidents to occur (sometimes called asset
valuations). This will include the values to business operations of the information to be transferred via a
network, any other information potentially accessible in an unauthorized way through the network, and of
the services provided),
− identifying and assessing the likelihood or levels of threats against the information and service,
− identifying and assessing the degrees of seriousness or levels of vulnerabilities (weaknesses) that could
be exploited by the identified threats,
− assessing the measures of risks, based on the determined measures of the potential adverse impacts on
business operations and the levels of threats and vulnerabilities,
− identifying the technical security architectural/design aspects and potential security control areas that are
justified by, and thus required to ensure that assessed risks remain within acceptable limits.
The main processes of network security risk assessment and management are shown in Figure 6 below. (This
is in effect an expansion of the box in Figure 4 above entitled “Determine Scope/ Context and then Assess
Risks” and its related box “Identifying Network Related Risks and preparing to Identify Security Controls”.)

Supporting Controls
Introduction

This clause provides an overview of the controls that support network security technical architectures and their
related technical controls, i.e. other controls (non-technical and technical) that are applicable not just to
networks. Information on many of these types of controls can be found in ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27002 and
ISO/IEC 27005. The controls that are especially important with regard to the use of networks are expanded
upon in the clause 8.2 to 8.9 below, which address the management of network security (network security
management activities, network security roles and responsibilities, network monitoring and evaluating network
security), technical vulnerability management, identification and authentication, network audit logging and
monitoring, intrusion detection, protection against malicious code, cryptographic based services, and business
continuity management. As relevant, references are provided to the relevant content of ISO/IEC 27001,
ISO/IEC 27002 and ISO/IEC 27005.

Management of Network Security

8.2.1

Background

The overall management of network security should be undertaken in a secure manner, and be accomplished
with due consideration of the different network protocols available and related security services. In furtherance
of this, an organization should consider a number of network security controls, the majority of which can be
identified through using ISO/IEC 27002 and ISO/IEC 27005. Those that need to be expanded upon in the
context of network security are described in clauses 8.2.2 to 8.2.5 below.
8.2.2
8.2.2.1

Network Security Management Activities
Introduction

A key requirement for any network is that it is supported by secure management activities, which will initiate
and control the implementation, and operation, of security. These activities should take place to ensure the
security of all of an organization/community’s information systems. Network security management activities
should include:
− definition of all responsibilities related to network security, and designation of a security manager with
overall responsibility,
− documented network security policy, and accompanying documented technical security architecture,
− documented network SecOPs,
− the conduct of security compliance checking, including security testing, to ensure security is maintained at
the required level,
− documented security conditions for network connection, to be adhered to before connection is permitted as relevant by internal and external organizations or people,
− documented security conditions for remote network users,
− a network security incident management scheme,
− documented and tested business continuity/disaster recovery plans.
For detailed information on these topics reference should be made to ISO/IEC 27002, ISO/IEC 27005 and
ISO/IEC 27035. Only those of the above topics that are especially important with regard to the use of
networks is further guidance provided in the clauses below.
8.2.2.2

Network Security Policy

It is the responsibility of management to visibly accept and support the organization’s network security policy
(as referred to in ISO/IEC 27002). This network security policy should flow from, and be consistent with, the
organization’s information security policy. The policy should be capable of implementation, readily available to
authorized members of the organization, and encompass clear statements on the:
− organization’s stance with respect to acceptable network usage,
− explicit rules for the secure use of specific network resources, services and applications,
− consequences of failure to comply with security rules,
− organization’s attitude towards network abuse,
− rationale(s) for the policy, and for any specific security rules.

23

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

(In some circumstances these clear statements can be incorporated into the information security policy, if this
is more convenient for the organization and/or it would be clearer for its personnel.)
The content of the network security policy should usually include a summary of the results from the network
security risk assessment and management review (which provides the justification for spend on controls),
including detail of all security controls selected commensurate with the assessed risks (see Clause 7.3
above).
8.2.2.3

Network Security Operating Procedures

In support of the network security policy, SecOPs documents should be developed and maintained. They
should contain details of the day-to-day operating procedures associated with network security, and who is
responsible for their use and management. An example template is shown at Annex C.
8.2.2.4

Network Security Compliance Checking

For all networks, security compliance checking should take place against a comprehensive checklist
constructed from the controls specified in the:
− network security policy,
− related SecOPs,
− technical security architecture,
− security gateway service access (security) policy,
− business continuity plan(s),
− where relevant, security conditions for connection.
This should occur prior to live operation of any network, prior to a major new release (related to significant
business or network related change), and otherwise annually.
This should include the conduct of security testing to recognized standards, with a security testing strategy
and related plans produced beforehand setting out exactly what tests are to be conducted, with what, where
and when. This should encompass a combination of vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. Prior to the
commencement of any such testing, the testing plan should be checked to ensure that the testing will be
conducted in a manner fully compatible with relevant legislation. When carrying out this checking it should not
be forgotten that a network may not just be confined to one country – it may be distributed through different
countries with different legislation. Following the testing, the reports should indicate the specifics of the
vulnerabilities encountered and the fixes required and in what priority.
8.2.2.5

Security Conditions for Multiple Organization Network Connections

Unless security conditions for connection are in place and contractually agreed, an organization is in effect
accepting the risks associated with the other end of a network connection outside of its domain. Such risks
can include those related to privacy/data protection, where a connection can be used to exchange personal
data subject to national legislation at one or both ends, and, where the other end of a network connection
(outside an organization’s domain) is in another country, the legislation may be different.
As an example, organization A may require that before organization B can be connected to its systems via a
network connection, B should maintain and demonstrate a specified level of security for its system involved in
that connection. In this way A can be assured that B is managing its risks in a way that is acceptable. In such
cases A should produce a security conditions for connection document that details the controls to be present
at B’s end. These should be implemented by B, followed by that organization signing a binding statement to
that effect and that security will be maintained. A would reserve the right to commission or conduct a
compliance check on B.
There will also be cases where organizations in a community mutually agree a ‘security conditions for
connection’ document which records obligations and responsibilities for all parties, including reciprocal
compliance checking.

8.2.2.6

Documented Security Conditions for Remote Network Users

Users authorized to work remotely should be issued with a documented ‘security conditions for remote
network users’ document. This should describe user responsibilities for the hardware, software and data in
relation to the network, and its security.
8.2.2.7

Network Security Incident Management

Information security incidents are more likely to occur, and more serious adverse business impacts to result,
where networks are used (as opposed to where there are none). Further, with networks connecting to other
organizations in particular there could well be significant legal implications connected with security incidents.
Thus, an organization with network connections should have a well documented and implemented information
security incident management scheme and related infrastructure in place to be able to respond quickly as
security incidents are identified, minimize their impact and learn the lessons to attempt to prevent reoccurrence. This scheme should be able to address both information security events (identified occurrences of
a system, service or network state indicating a possible breach of information security policy or failure of
safeguards, or a previously unknown situation that may be security relevant), and information security
incidents (a single or a series of unwanted or unexpected information security events that have a significant
probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security). Further detail on
information security incident management is provided in ISO/IEC 27035.
8.2.3

Network Security Roles and Responsibilities

The roles and responsibilities that should be instigated associated with network security management are as
follows. (Note that, depending upon the size of the organization, these roles can be combined.)
Senior management:
− define the organization’s security objectives,
− initiate, approve, publish, and impose the organization’s security policy, procedures and rules,
− initiate, approve, publish, and impose the organization’s acceptable usage policy,
− ensure security and acceptable usage policies are enforced,
NOTE

Senior management includes the business owners.

Network management:
− develop detailed network security policy,
− implement the network security policy,
− implement the acceptable usage policy,
− manage the interface with external stakeholders / external service providers to ensure conformance with
internal and external network security policies,
− ensure that operational responsibility for networks is separated from computer operations, where
appropriate,
Network Security team:
− acquire, develop, test, check and maintain network security components and tools,
− maintain network security tools and components to follow closely the evolution of threats (e.g. updating
malicious code (including virus) signature files),
− update network security relevant configurations (e.g. access control lists ) according to changing business
needs,

25

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

Network administrators:
− install, update, use and protect network security services and components,
− carry out the necessary daily tasks to apply the network security specifications, rules, and parameters
required by the network security policies in force,
− take appropriate measures to assure the protection of network security components (e.g. back-ups,
monitoring network activity, responding to security incidents or alarms, etc.),
Network users:
− communicate their security requirements,
− comply with corporate security policy,
− comply with corporate acceptable usage policies for network resources,
− report network security events and incidents,
− provide feedback on network security effectiveness,
Auditors (internal and/or external):
− review and audit (e.g. periodically test the effectiveness of network security),
− check compliance with network security policy,
− check and test compatibility of operating network security rules with the current business requirements and
legal restrictions (e.g. lists granted for network accesses).
8.2.4

Network Monitoring

Network monitoring is a very important part of network security management. This is dealt with in Clause 8.5
below.
8.2.5

Evaluating Network Security

Network security is a dynamic concept. Security staff should keep up to date with developments in the field
and ensure that networks continues to work with the most current security patches and fixes available from
vendors. Steps should be taken periodically to audit existing security controls against established
benchmarks, including by security testing – vulnerability scanning, etc. Security should be a primary
consideration in evaluating new network technology and network environments.

8.3

Technical Vulnerability Management

Network environments, as other complex systems, are not free of errors. Technical vulnerabilities are present
in, and are published for, components frequently used in networks. The exploitation of these technical
vulnerabilities can have severe impact on the security of networks, most often observed in the areas of
availability and confidentiality. Thus technical vulnerability management should be present covering all
network components, and should include:
− obtaining timely information about technical vulnerabilities,
− evaluating the exposure of networks to such vulnerabilities,
− defining appropriate security controls to address the associated risks, and
− the implementation and verification of the defined security controls.

26

© ISO/IEC 2009 – All rights reserved

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

A prerequisite for technical vulnerability management should be the availability of a current and complete
inventory of all network components, providing the necessary technical information, e.g. type of device,
vendor, version numbers of hardware, firmware or software, and also organizational information, e.g. the
responsible administrative persons.
If the organization has already set up an overall technical vulnerability management program, the integration
of technical network vulnerability management into the overall task should be the preferred solution. (Further
information on technical vulnerability management, including implementation guidance, can be found in
ISO/IEC 27002.)

8.4

Identification and Authentication

It is important to be able to restrict access through connections to authorized personnel (whether internal or
external to the organization). For example, it is a common policy requirement that access to certain network
services and related information should be restricted to authorized personnel. Requirements for these are not
exclusive to the use of network connections, and thus detail appropriate to the use of networks should be
obtained by using ISO/IEC 27002 and ISO/IEC 27005.
Three security control areas that could be relevant to the use of networks, and related information systems,
are:
− remote log-ins – whether from authorized personnel working away from the organization, from remote
maintenance engineers, or personnel from other organizations, which are accomplished either via dial-ups
to the organization, Internet connections, dedicated trunks from other organizations, or shared access
through the Internet. They are connections established at need by either internal systems or contractual
partners using public networks. Each type of remote log-in should have additional security controls
appropriate to the nature of the network concerned, e.g. not allowing direct access to system and network
software from accounts used for remote access, except where additional authentication has been provided
(see below) – and perhaps end-to-end encryption, and protecting information associated with e-mail
software and directory data stored on PCs and laptops used outside of an organization’s offices by its
personnel from unauthorized access,
− authentication enhancements – whilst the use of user id/password pairs is a simple way to authenticate
users, they can be compromised or guessed. Thus other more secure ways to authenticate users should
be considered – particularly for remote users and/or when a high possibility exists that an unauthorized
person may gain access to protected and important systems – say because the access may be initiated
using public networks, or the accessing system can be out of the direct control of the organization (e.g. via
a laptop). Simple examples are using CLID (but as this is open to spoofing it should not be used as a
proven ID without further authentication) and links via modems that are disconnected when not in use –
and only connected after verification of the caller’s identity. More complex, but much more secure,
examples – particularly in the context of remote access, are using other means of identification to support
the authentication of users such as remotely verified tokens and smart cards – and ensuring that the token
or card can only function in conjunction with the authorized user’s authenticated account (and preferably,
that user’s PC and location/access point) and, for example, any related PIN or biometric profile.
Generically this is termed strong, two factor, authentication,
− secure single sign-on – where networks are involved users are likely to encounter multiple identification
and authentication checks. In such circumstances users can be tempted to adopt insecure practices such
as writing down passwords or re-using the same authentication data. Secure single sign-on can reduce the
risks associated with such behavior by reducing the number of passwords that users have to remember.
As well as reducing risks, user productivity may be improved and helpdesk workloads associated with
password resets may be reduced. However, note that the consequences of failure of a secure single signon system could be severe because not one but many systems and applications would be at risk and open
to compromise (sometimes termed the ”keys to the kingdom” risk). Stronger than normal identification and
authentication mechanisms can therefore be necessary, and it may be desirable to exclude identification
and authentication to highly privileged (system level) functions from a secure single sign-on regime.

8.5

Network Audit Logging and Monitoring

It is very important to ensure the effectiveness of network security through audit logging and ongoing
monitoring, with the rapid detection, investigation and reporting of, and response to, security events and then
incidents. Without this activity, it is not possible to be sure that network security controls always remain
effective and that security incidents will not occur with resultant adverse effects on business operations.
Sufficient audit log information of error conditions and valid events should be recorded to enable thorough
review for suspected, and of actual, incidents. However, recognizing that recording huge amounts of audit
related information can make analysis difficult to manage, and can affect performance, care has to be taken
over time in what is actually recorded. For network, audit logs should be maintained that include the following
types of event:
− remote failed log-on attempts with dates and times,
− failed re-authentication (or token usage) events,
− security gateway traffic breaches,
− remote attempts to access audit logs,
− system management alerts/alarms with security implications (e.g. IP address duplication, bearer circuit
disruptions).
In a network context, audit logs should be drawn from a number of sources, such as routers, firewalls, IDS,
and sent to a central audit server for consolidation and thorough analysis. All audit logs should be examined in
both real time and off line. In real time, logs can be displayed on a rolling screen and used to alert potential
attacks. Off line analysis is essential as this allows the greater picture to be determined with trend analysis
being undertaken. First indications of an attack can be that there are substantial “drops” in the firewall logs,
indicating probing activity against a potential target. An IDS system can also detect this in real time against an
attack signature.
It is emphasized that for analysis and investigative purposes suitable approved audit log management and
analysis software must be used for log storage and retrieval, traceability and reporting from audit logs (against
particular users, applications and information types, and by time period, particularly when required for
investigative purposes) and reporting – with quick, focused and readily understandable outputs. The audit log
analysis reports must be held in a secure location, and archived for an agreed period of time. Further,
identification and authentication, and access control, protection must be place for the audit logs themselves.
Ongoing monitoring should include coverage of
− audit logs from firewalls, routers, servers, etc.,
− alerts/alarms from such as audit logs pre-configured to notify certain event types, from such as firewalls,
routers, servers,
− output from IDS,
− results from network security scanning activities,
− information on events and incidents reported by users and support personnel, and
− results from security compliance reviews.
Audit trails should be maintained online for a period in accordance with the needs of the organization, with all
audit trails backed up and archived in a manner that ensures integrity and availability, e.g. by using WORM
media such as CDs. Further, audit logs contain sensitive information or information of use to those who may
wish to attack the system through network connections, and possession of audit logs can provide proof of
transfer over a network in the event of a dispute – and are therefore particularly necessary in the context of

ensuring integrity and non-repudiation. Therefore all audit logs should be appropriately protected, including
when archived CDs are destroyed at the designated date. Audit trails should be securely retained for a period
in accordance with organizational requirements and national legislation, It is also important that time
synchronization is properly addressed for all audit trails and related servers, for example using NTP,
particularly for forensics and possible use in prosecutions.
It is emphasized that network monitoring should be conducted in a manner fully compatible with relevant
national and international legislation and regulation. This includes legislation for data protection and for
regulation of investigatory powers (where by law all users have to be informed of any monitoring before it is
conducted). In general terms monitoring should be conducted responsibly, and not for instance used for
reviewing the behavior of employees in countries with very limited privacy laws. Obviously the actions taken
should be consistent with the security and privacy policies of the organization/community, and appropriate
procedures with related responsibilities put in place. Network audit logging and monitoring should also be
conducted in a forensically secure manner if audit log evidence is to be used in criminal or civil prosecution.
Most audit logging and monitoring controls required in relation to use of networks and related information
systems can be determined by using ISO/IEC 27002 and ISO/IEC 27005.

8.6

Intrusion Detection and Prevention

As the use of networks increases, it becomes easier for intruders to find multiple ways to penetrate an
organization or community’s information systems and networks, to disguise their initial point of access, and to
access through networks and target internal information systems. Further, intruders are becoming more
sophisticated, and more advanced methods of attack and tools are easily available on the Internet or in the
open literature. Indeed, many of these tools are automated, can be very effective, and easy to use – including
by persons with limited experience.
For most organizations it is economically impossible to prevent all potential penetrations. Consequently, some
intrusions are likely to occur. The risks associated with most of these penetrations should be addressed
through the implementation of good identification and authentication, logical access control and accounting
and audit controls, and, if justified, together with intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. Such
capabilities provide the means by which to predict intrusions, identify intrusions in real-time and raise
appropriate alarms, and to prevent intrusions. It also enables local collection of information on intrusions, and
subsequent consolidation and analysis, as well as analysis of an organization’s normal information system
patterns of behavior/usage.
An IDS listens all traffic into internal networks to identify that an intrusion has been attempted, is occurring, or
has occurred and possibly respond to intrusions, as well as alerting appropriate personnel. There are two
types of IDS:
− NIDS, which monitor packets on a network and attempts to discover an intruder by matching the attack
pattern to a database of known attack patterns, and
− HIDS, which monitor activity on the hosts (servers) – by monitoring security event logs or checking for
changes to the system, such as changes to critical system files, or to the systems registry.
An IPS checks all traffic before it passes into internal networks and automatically blocks all recognized
attacks; in other words and IPS is specifically designed to provide an active response capability.
Detailed guidance on intrusion detection and prevention is provided in ISO/IEC 18043.

8.7

Protection against Malicious Code

Malicious code (viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, etc. – which are often collectively termed ‘malware’) can be
introduced through network connections. Malicious code can cause a computer to perform unauthorized
functions (e.g. bombard a given target with messages at a given date and time), or indeed destroy essential
resources (e.g. delete files) as soon as it has replicated to try to find other vulnerable hosts. Malicious code
can not be detected before damage is done unless suitable controls are implemented. Malicious code may
result in compromise of security controls (e.g. capture and disclosure of passwords), unintended disclosure of

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

information, unintended changes to information, destruction of information, and/or unauthorized use of system
resources.
Some forms of malicious code should be detected and removed by special scanning software. Scanners are
available for firewalls, file servers, mail servers, and PCs/workstations for some types of malicious code.
Further, to enable detection of new malicious code it is very important to ensure that the scanning software is
always kept up to date, desirably through daily updates. However, users and administrators should be made
aware that scanners cannot be relied upon to detect all malicious code (or even all malicious code of a
particular type) because new forms of malicious code are continually arising. Typically, other forms of control
are required to augment the protection provided by scanners (where they exist).
Overall, it is the job of anti-malicious code software to scan data and programs to identify suspicious patterns
associated with malware. The library of patterns to be scanned for is known as signatures, and should be
updated at regular intervals, or whenever new signatures become available for high-risk malware alerts. In the
context of remote access, anti-malicious code software should be run on the remote systems and also on the
servers on the central system – especially Windows and e-mail servers.
Network users and administrators should be made aware that there are greater than normal risks associated
with malicious software when dealing with external parties over external links. Guidelines for users and
administrators should be developed outlining procedures and practices to minimize the possibility for
introducing malicious code.
Users and administrators should take special care to configure systems and applications associated with
network connections to disable functions that are not necessary in the circumstances, for example, PC
applications could be configured so that macros are disabled by default, or require user confirmation before
execution of macros.
Further detail on malicious code protection is provided in ISO/IEC 27002 and ISO/IEC 27005.
NOTE
ISO/IEC 11889 describes technology widely deployed in client and server systems that can be used for the
detection and isolation of code of malicious or unknown origin.

8.8

Cryptographic Based Services

Where preservation of confidentiality is important, encryption controls should be considered to encrypt
information passing over networks. Where preservation of integrity is important, digital signature and/or
message integrity controls should be considered to protect information passing over network connections.
Digital signature controls can provide similar protection to message authentication controls, but also have
properties that allow them to enable non-repudiation procedures.
Where there is a requirement to ensure that substantive proof can be provided that information was carried by
a network (non-repudiation), controls such as the following should be considered:
− communication protocols that provide acknowledgement of submission,
− application protocols that require the originator’s address or identifier to be provided and check for the
presence of this information,
− gateways that check sender and receiver address formats for validity of syntax and consistency with
information in relevant directories,
− protocols that acknowledge delivery from networks, and that allow the sequence of information to be
determined.
Where it is important that information transmission or receipt can be proven if it is contested (another form of
non-repudiation), further assurance should be provided through the use of a standard digital signature
method. Senders of information, where proof of source is required, should seal the information using a digital
signature to a common standard. Where proof of delivery is required, senders should request a reply sealed
with a digital signature.

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

The decision to use encryption, digital signature, message integrity or other encryption based controls should
take account of relevant government laws and regulations, and, as relevant, appropriate public key
infrastructures, the requirements for key management, the suitability of the underlying mechanisms used for
the type of network involved and the degree of protection required, and reliable and trusted registration of
users or entities associated with keys (certified where relevant) used in digital signature protocols.
Encryption mechanisms are standardized in ISO/IEC 18033. One commonly used encryption technique is
known as a block cipher, and ways of using block ciphers for encryption protection, known as modes of
operation, are standardized in ISO/IEC 10116. Message integrity controls, known as Message Authentication
Codes (or MACs), are standardized in ISO/IEC 9797. Digital signature techniques are standardized in
ISO/IEC 9796 and ISO/IEC 14888. Further information on non-repudiation is provided in ISO/IEC 14516 and
ISO/IEC 13888.
Key management ensures, as a basic service for all other cryptographic services, that all necessary
encryption keys are managed during their complete lifecycle and are used in a secure way. For information on
key management, and related topics such as PKI or the more encompassing topic of identity management,
reference should be made to other documents and standards, such as:
− ISO/IEC 11770 (Key management),
− ISO/IEC 9594-8 (The Directory: Public-key and attribute certificate frameworks),
− ISO 11166-2 (Banking, key management by means of asymmetric algorithms),
− ISO 11568 (Banking – retail key management),
− ISO 11649 (Financial services – Structured creditor reference to remittance information),
− ISO 13492 (Retail key management data elements),
− ISO 21118 (Banking Public Key Infrastructure).
Note that cryptography should also be used for the management of network devices. Further, access and
network management logs should be transmitted in secure encrypted sessions to protect sensitive data.

8.9

Business Continuity Management

It is important that controls are in place to ensure the ongoing function of the business in the event of a
disaster by providing the ability to recover each part of the business subsequent to a disruption in an
appropriate time frame. Thus an organization should have a business continuity management program in
place, with processes covering all business continuity stages – business impact analysis review, risk
assessment review, establishing business recovery requirements, business continuity strategy formulation,
business continuity plan production, business continuity plan testing, ensuring business continuity awareness
for all staff, ongoing business continuity plan maintenance, and risk reduction. Only by following all stages can
it be ensured that the:
− required business priorities and timescales are in line with business needs,
− preferred business continuity strategy options identified are commensurate with those priorities and
timescales, and thus,
− correct and necessary plans and facilities are put in place, and tested, encompassing information,
business processes, information systems and services, voice and data communications, people and
physical facilities.
Guidance on business continuity management as a whole, including the development of an appropriate
business continuity strategy and related plans, and their subsequent testing, can be obtained in
ISO/PAS 22399:2007.
From the network perspective, it is the maintenance of network connections, the implementation of alternative
connections of sufficient capacity, and the recovery of connections subsequent to unwanted events, that have
to be addressed. These aspects and requirements should be based on the importance of the connections to

the functioning of the business over time, and the projected adverse business impacts in the event of
disruption. Whilst connectivity can afford many advantages to an organization, in the event of a disruption, in
terms of flexibility and the ability to make use of creative approaches, they can also represent points of
vulnerability and ”single points of failure”, which could have major disruptive impacts on the organization.

Guidelines for the Design and Implementation of Network Security
Background

This clause addresses the various network technical security architecture/design aspects and related potential
control areas. Clause 10 introduces the risk, design techniques and security control areas for reference
network scenarios. Clause 11 introduces the risks, design techniques and security control issues for particular
‘technology’ topics of concern to today’s organizations. A particular network security solution can in fact
encompass a number of the topics and control areas introduced in Clauses 10 and 11. A table that shows
cross-references between ISO/IEC 27001/27002 network security related controls and ISO/IEC 27033-1
clauses is shown at Annex B.
Having followed Clauses 8 to 11 (and Annex A), the proposed technical security architecture/design and list of
identified controls should be thoroughly reviewed in the context of the relevant network architectures and
applications. The architecture and list of controls should then be adjusted as necessary and subsequently be
used as the basis for developing, implementing and testing the technical security solution (see Clause 12
below). Then once the technical security architecture and thus security control implementation have been
signed-off, then live operations should commence (see Clause 13 below), with ongoing monitoring and
reviewing of the implementation (see Clause 14 below).

9.2

Network Technical Security Architecture/Design

The documentation of the possible technical security architecture/design and implementation options provides
a means for the examination of different solutions, and a basis for trade-off analysis. This also facilitates the
resolution of issues associated with technical constraints, and contentions between the requirements of the
business and for security, that will often arise.
In documenting the options, due account should be taken of any corporate information security policy
requirements (see Clause 7.2.1 above), the relevant network architecture, applications, services, types of
connection and other characteristics (see Clause 7.2.2 above), and the list of potential controls identified by
the security risk assessment and management review (see Clause 7.3 above). In accomplishing this, account
should be taken of any existing technical security architectures/designs. Once the options have been
documented and reviewed, as part of the technical architecture design process, the preferred security
architecture should be agreed and documented in a Technical Security Architecture/Design Control
Specification document (that is compatible with the Technical Architecture Design, and vice versa). Then,
changes might result to the network architecture, applications and services (to ensure compatibility with the
preferred technical security architecture/design), and/or the list of potential controls (e.g. because it is agreed
that the security architecture/design can only be technically implemented in a particular way, necessitating an
alternative to an identified control).
Note that ISO/IEC 27033-2 defines how organizations should achieve quality technical security
architectures/designs that will ensure network security appropriate to their business environments, using a
consistent approach to the planning, design and implementation of network security.
The inputs to the network technical security architecture/design development process, as described in
ISO/IEC 27033-2, include the:
− the organization/community’s documented service requirements,
− documentation of any existing or planned architecture, design and/or implementation,

− current network security policy (or relevant parts of the associated information system security policy) –
preferably based on the results from a security risk assessment and management review,
− definition of the assets that should be protected,
− current and planned performance requirements, including traffic related,
− current product information.
The outputs from the design process include:
− the network technical security architecture/design document,
− service access (security) requirements documents for each security gateway/firewall system (which
includes the firewall rule base(s)),
− Security Operating Procedures (SecOPs),
− as relevant, conditions for secure network connection for third parties,
− as relevant, user guidelines for the third party users.
The network technical security architecture/design document is described in detail in ISO/IEC 27033-2, which
also contains an example template for service access (security) requirements documents at Appendix D (of
ISO/IEC 27033-2). Further information on the other documents referred to can be found in clause 8.2.2 above
and also in ISO/IEC 27033-2.
(Further, once the required network technical security architecture/design has been documented and
implemented, then security test plans should be produced and security testing conducted. Once acceptable
test results have been achieved, with any adjustments made in the light of problems found during testing, then
formal management sign-off should be obtained for the network technical security architecture/design and
implementation completed (see Clause 12 below).)
Information on each of the following activities is provided in ISO/IEC 27033-2 (and thus not repeated here):
− preparing for the technical design and implementation of network security:
− network security project initiation,
− confirming the broad network requirements of the organization/community,
− reviewing the existing and/or planned technical architecture and implementation. (All existing and/or
planned technical architectures and implementations should be described, and checks made that they
are consistent with the organization/community’s functional requirements and needs – see previous
bullet.),
− asset identification/confirmation,
− confirming the security risk assessment and management results, and reviewing existing and/or
planned network security controls in the context of those results, and selecting potential security
controls,
− reviewing network performance requirements and confirming criteria. (Performance requirements need
to be reviewed, queries resolved and the performance criteria required to be met by the technical
architecture and related technical security architecture/design formally agreed. Thus data is required to
enable the configurations for communication lines, servers, security gateways, etc., etc., to be identified
that will ensure the required service availability.),
− network technical security design, including coverage of all applicable technical topics (dealt with in line
with the headings in ISO/IEC 27001:2007), and:

− use of models/frameworks (including ITU-T X.805, and others,
− product selection (which should be conducted as an iterative process associated with the design of the
network technical security architecture, and not undertaken in isolation, and should be based on many

service set is envisaged (recognizing that products do not always conform to vendor provided data!),
− network technical security architecture/design completion, and related documentation,
− preparing for testing (a security testing strategy document should be produced describing the approach to
be taken with testing to prove the network technical security architecture, primarily concentrating on how
the key technical security controls should be tested. Then a test plan should be developed for the network
technical security architecture, encompassing much detail including on the tests to be conducted, by whom
and from where.),

Further, reference should be made to the annexes of 27033-2 – example model/framework1) (“reference”
architecture) for network security, model/framework case study, and example documentation templates.
It is emphasized that the technical security architecture/design for any project should be fully documented and
agreed, before finalizing the list of security controls for implementation.

10 Reference Network Scenarios – Risks, Design, Techniques and Control Issues
10.1 Introduction
ISO/IEC 27033 Part 3 describes the risks, design techniques and control issues associated with reference
network scenarios. Some examples of these scenarios is introduced in clauses 10. 2 to 10.10 below. Part 3
provides detailed guidance on the security risks and the security design techniques and controls required to
mitigate those risks on all specific scenarios. Where relevant, Part 3 includes references to Parts 4 to 7 to
avoid duplicating the content of those documents.

10.2 Internet Access Services for Employees
Today almost all organizations provide Internet access services for their employees, and in providing such
services should consider access for clear identified and authorized purposes, not general open access. It
should be defined in a specific policy which services are provided, and for what purposes. Internet Access is
normally allowed for business reasons, and subject to organization policy Internet Access can also allowed
(usually in limited form) for private purposes. Consideration needs to be given to which services are allowed to
be used – is it basic services such as www (http & https), is only information retrieving allowed and/or
employees allowed to participate in chat channels, forums etc., are enhanced collaboration services allowed –
if yes they introduce their own set of risks which are dealt within a specific scenario.
The basic principle should be that only services which serve the business needs are allowed, but often
business operations require the use of services which have more associated security risks. Even when a
restrictive policy is in place, Internet access services for employees does introduce substantial security risks.

10.3 Enhanced Collaboration Services
Enhanced collaboration services (such as instant messaging - chat, video-conferencing and document sharing
environments), which integrate various communication and document sharing possibilities, are gaining more
and more importance in today's business environments. Such collaboration services typically integrate video
telephony, voice communication with chat channels, e-mail systems, as well as document sharing and online
co-working environments. There are two basic ways how to use such services for an organization:
− use them as internal services only, but with the disadvantage that the services cannot be used with
external partners, etc.,
− use them as internal services and services external to an organization. This offers much more benefit from
using such services, but at the same time has more associated security risks compared with only internal
usage.
Regarding implementation, the services can be implemented in-house, or just bought in as a service from a
third party. In many cases where in-house services only are to be used, an in-house implementation will be
most likely. If the services are to be used internally and externally, then buying in collaboration services from a
third party can be a more appropriate solution. The security risks and advice on security design techniques
and controls to mitigate those risks are described for both internal, and internal plus external, usage.

10.4 Business to Business Services
Traditionally business to business services have been implemented by using dedicated leased lines or
network segments. The Internet and the related technologies do provide more options, but also introduce new
security risks associated with the implementation of such services. Typically business to business services
have their own requirements. For example, availability and reliability are very important requirements as
frequently organizations are directly dependent on working business to business services.
When using the Internet as a base network connection to implement business to business services,
requirements such as availability and reliability need to be handled differently than before. Proven measures
such as quality of service assumptions used, e.g. in conjunction with leased lines, do not work any more. The
new security risks need to be mitigated by appropriate design techniques and controls.

10.5 Business to Customer Services
Business to customer services include e-commerce and e-banking. Requirements include confidentiality
(especially regarding e-banking), authentication (what methods are possible today - e.g. two factor, certificate
based, etc., relationship between the cost of implementation - typically high since very large number of
customers, and the reductions in the risks of such as financial loss, loss of business reputation/credibility),
integrity, and resistance against sophisticated attacks - e.g. ‘man in the middle’ or ‘man in the browser’
attacks.
Characteristics include:
− security only ‘guaranteed’ on the end platform typically under the control of an organization, providing a
good environment for implementing controls and maintaining a good platform level security,
− security on the customer platform, often a PC, can typically be poor. It is harder to get controls
implemented in such an environment, and thus customer platforms would present significant risks in this
scenario (without a ‘conditions for secure connection’ set of requirements in a contract, which can be
difficult to impose in such an environment).

10.6 Outsourcing Services
Due to the complexity of today's IT environments many organizations use externally provided IT support
services or have fully or partially outsourced the support of their IT infrastructure, and/or use other outsourced
services. Many vendors also have requirements for direct access to their products in use in customer
organizations, to be able to appropriately handle support and/or incident management issues.

35

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

Whilst many outsourced services require permanent access rights, e.g. to a supported infrastructure, others
may only need temporary access. In some cases outsourced services need highly privileged access rights in
order to fulfill the required tasks, especially in incident management scenarios.

10.7 Network Segmentation
For many, particularly multi-national, organizations country specific legislation has a great influence on
information security requirements. International organizations typically do business in a number of different
countries, and therefore have an obligation to comply with various country specific legislations, which
furthermore could result in different information security requirements for each country an organization is
active in. For example, a particular country’s legislation can require specific protection of customer/client data,
and does not allow the transfer of such data to another country. This typically requires additional information
security controls to guarantee compliance with such legislation.
To cover the different information security requirements for the countries an international organization is doing
business in, segmentation of a network in effect in line with country borders can be an effective broad solution.
In many cases such a broad solution could be used to build up a separate barrier of defense, e.g. in addition
to application level access control.

10.8 Mobile Communications
This reference network scenario concerns personal mobile communication devices, e.g. smart phones or
PDAs, which have become very popular. (Guidance of the security aspects of the communications over
networks to and from such devices is provided in such as ISO 27033-7 on securing communications over
wireless and radio networks.)
Although the main driver for the fast development of new features of personal mobile communication devices
comes from the consumer market, these features are also used in business environments. As the term
‘personal’ implicates, often such devices are personally owned and used both for business and private
purposes. Even devices directed at the business market need to have features introduced for the consumer
market, as the vendors want to gain as much business as possible in a competitive market.
Many of the new features available with such devices, the growth of device memory capabilities, and
permanent on line connectivity via the Internet that is open to the public, means significant information security
risks – as do situations where a person uses the same device for private as well as business purposes.
Further, with the high popularity of personal mobile communication devices and their status as a ‘personal
gadget’, in many cases restrictive policies to only use a limited feature set or to only allow a limited number of
devices are likely to fail or be circumvented and thus meaning limited information security effectiveness.

10.9 Network Support for Traveling Users
Today traveling users expect connectivity levels comparable to what which they have in fixed locations, such
as their base office. Solutions and offerings in this area often focus on the functionality side. From an
information security viewpoint, the offered functionality levels introduce new risks, e.g. by affecting or
invalidating assumptions regarding information security. For example, an assumption of maintaining a well
controlled and (from the outside) protected Intranet may be questioned substantially if traveling user access to
the Intranet is not implemented with appropriate controls.

10.10 Network Support for Home and Small Business Offices
Home and small business offices often require the extension of the internal network of an organization to a
home or small business location. The costs of extensions to home or small business locations is a critical
issue, since cost/benefit reflections typically do not require high implementation costs. This means cost
limitations on the security controls to be used to secure such network extensions and typically prevents the
use of established inter-networking security controls used to connect bigger Intranet segments.

In many home or small business scenarios the infrastructure can also be used for private as well as for
business purposes – which can result in additional information security risks. The security risks are defined
and advice on security design techniques and controls to mitigate those risks are described.

11 ‘Technology’ Topics – Risks, Design Techniques and Control Issues
Details of the security risks, design techniques and control issues associated with ‘technology’ topics are
shown in Annex A. The topics covered are:
− local area networks (see A.1),
− wide are networks (see A.2),
− wireless networks (see A.3),
− radio networks (see A.4),
− broadband networks (see A.5),
− security gateways (see A.6),
− virtual private networks (see A.7),
− voice networks (see A.8),
− IP Convergence (see A.9),
− web hosting (see A.10),
− Internet e-mail (see A.11),
− routed access to third party organizations (see A.12),
− data center (see A.13)

12 Develop and Test Security Solution
Once the technical security architecture has been fully documented and agreed, including by senior
management, then the solution should be developed, implemented in ‘trial mode’ and thoroughly tested and
compliance checked.
General ‘fit for purpose’ testing of the solution should first be conducted, with a testing strategy document
produced describing the approach to be taken with testing to prove the solution and then a test plan. There
may need to be changes made as a result of deficiencies identified by this type of testing and any necessary
re-testing carried out.
Once the ‘fit for purpose’ testing has been successfully completed and any changes made, the implementation
should be reviewed for compliance with the documented technical security architecture and required security
controls specified in the following documents:
− technical security architecture,
− network security policy,
− related SecOPs,
− security gateway service access (security) policy,
− business continuity plan(s),
− where relevant, security conditions for connection.

37

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

The compliance review should be completed prior to live operation. The review should be complete when all
deficiencies have been identified, fixed, and signed off by senior management.
It is emphasized that this should include the conduct of security testing to relevant recognized national,
government, community standards (in the absence of international standards), with a security testing strategy
and related security test plans produced beforehand setting out exactly what tests are to be conducted, with
what, where and when. (An example template for a security test plan is given in ISO/IEC 27033-2.) This
should encompass a combination of vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. Prior to the
commencement of any such testing, the testing plan should be checked to ensure that the testing will be
conducted in a manner fully compatible with relevant legislation and regulation. When carrying out this
checking it should not be forgotten that a network may not just be confined to one country – it can be
distributed through different countries with different legislation. Following the testing, the reports should
indicate the specifics of the vulnerabilities encountered and the fixes required and in what priority, with an
addendum confirming that all agreed fixes have been applied. Such reports should be signed off by senior
management.
Finally, when all is satisfactory, the implementation should be signed off and accepted - including by senior
management.

13 Operate Security Solution
“Operate” means running the live (day to day) networking with the agreed secure solution in place, with
security testing having been conducted and related required actions completed beforehand. In other words,
once the technical security architecture and thus security control implementation have been signed-off, then
live operations should commence. Over time, and if significant change occurs, then further implementation
testing and review should be conducted (see also Clause 14 below).

14 Monitor and Review Solution Implementation
Following the commencement of live operations, ongoing monitoring and compliance review activities should
be conducted in line with relevant recognized national, government, community standards (in the absence of
international standards). Such activities should be conducted prior to a major new release related to significant
changes in business needs, technology, security solutions, etc., and otherwise annually. The activities here
should follow the pattern as described in Clause 12 above.

Annex A
(informative)
‘Technology’ Topics – Risks, Design Techniques and Control Issues

A.1 Local Area Networks
A.1.1 Background
A LAN is a network to interconnect computers and servers in a small geographic area. The size ranges from a
few interconnected systems, e.g. forming a home network, to a few thousands, e.g. in a campus network.
Typical services implemented include the sharing of resources like printers, and the sharing of files and
applications. LANs typically also provide central services like messaging or calendar services. In some cases
LANs are also used to substitute the traditional function of other networks, e.g. when VoIP protocols and
services are provided as a substitute for a PBX based phone network. A LAN can be wired, or wireless based.
A wired LAN usually consists of nodes connected in a network via a network switch using network cables,
which can provide high-speed data network capabilities. The most commonly used wired LAN technology is
Ethernet (IEEE 802.3).
A WLAN makes use of high frequency radio waves to send network packets over the air. Its flexibility lies in
the fact that a LAN can be established quickly without the need of wiring the network. Well-known wireless
LAN technologies include IEEE 802.11 implementations and Bluetooth.
When LAN networks are used within physically protected areas, e.g. only within an organization’s own
premises, then the risks are likely to be such that only basic technical controls are required. However, for use
in larger environments, and also when wireless technologies are used, physical protection alone is unlikely to
guarantee any level of security.
The desktop is a vulnerable area as it is the user interface. If the desktop is not locked down then it is possible
for a user to install unauthorized software on the LAN. Server systems used within a corporate network, both
ones exposed to the Internet and internal servers that have no direct connection to the Internet, could have
associated major security risks – which have to be taken very seriously. For example, while most IT
departments would claim that they are diligent about applying patches as soon as they are available, even
large organizations have failed to patch all servers in a timely manner – leading to disruption of internal
network traffic by worms and viruses.

A.1.2 Security Risks
In a wired LAN, security risks will arise from the nodes physically connected to the network. Overall, the key
security risks related to LANs include those associated with:
− unauthorized access and changes to desktop PCs, servers, and other LAN connected devices,
− unpatched devices,
− poor quality passwords,
− theft of hardware,
− failure of power supplies,
− import of malicious code through e-mail and Web access,
− failure to back up local hard discs,

− failure of hardware, such as hard discs,
− unauthorized connections to the LAN infrastructure, e.g. switches and patch cabinets,
− unauthorized connections to end devices, e.g. laptops,
− default passwords on the management ports of network devices,
− intrusion, where information is disclosed or the integrity and/or availability of data cannot then be
guaranteed,
− DoS attacks, where resources become unavailable to authorized users,
− extended latency, which will affect services such as voice over IP services,
− device failure,
− cable failure,
− poor physical security.
The security risks associated with wireless LANS are described in clause A.3.2.

A.1.3 Security Controls
Keeping the LAN space secure requires both the LAN components and connected devices to be secured.
Thus the controls to secure a LAN environment could include:
− physical and environmental:
− use steel cable systems to protect CPUs, monitors and keyboards from theft,
− use locks on devices to prevent parts, such as memory, from being stolen,
− use of proximity devices to prevent unauthorized removal from site,
− ensure that LAN devices, such as switches and routers, are kept in physically secure cabinets in secure
communications rooms,
− provide UPS with auto shutdown for critical devices, and for users’ PCs if they do not want to lose work
in progress,
− hardware and software:
− configure devices with private (e.g. IP) addresses,
− strong password policy,
− require logon at each PC/workstation, at least with at least a user id/ password pair,
− display time of last successful log-on,
− do not re-display the last successful log-on username, nor any list of previously used usernames,
− install anti-malicious code (including anti-virus) software, and regularly update automatically,
− implement secure configuration settings,

− disable floppy disc drive, CD-ROM drive, and USB ports,
− mirror server drives (or implement RAID) for redundancy,
− remove unnecessary software,
− ensure good desktop management in place,
− operational:
− document software and security settings for future use in configuring new PCs/workstations,
− schedule periodic download and installation of operating system patches,
− create and maintain current Emergency Repair Disks, and store in a controlled location,
− implement log to record maintenance problems and misuse of PCs/workstations,
− file all PC/workstation component documentation (papers/manuals/disks) for use by service technicians,
− ensure a back-up regime,
− ensure that all network devices have default passwords changed,
− set appropriate network management protocol passwords/community strings,
− encryption of network traffic,
− configure audit logs properly, if available, and implement procedures for monitoring audit logs,
− schedule periodic installation of firmware updates,
− document equipment settings for future use in reconfiguring equipment; make backup copy of router
configuration file, and store in secure location,
− test all LAN connected devices for vulnerabilities.
The security controls associated with wireless LANS are described in clause A.3.3.

A.2 Wide Area Networks
A.2.1 Background
WANs are used to connect distant locations, and their LANs, together. A WAN can be constructed using
cables, circuits from a service provider, or by renting a service from a telecommunications provider. WAN
technologies allow the transmission and routing of network traffic over long distance, and usually provide
extensive routing features to route network packets to the correct destination LAN. Typically public physical
network infrastructure is used for interconnecting LANs, e.g. leased lines, satellite communications or fiber
optics. A WAN can be wired, or wireless based.
A wired WAN usually consists of routing devices (e.g. routers) connected to a public or private network via
telecommunication wires. A wireless WAN typically uses radio waves to send network packets over the air for
a long distance, which can be up to ten kilometers or more.
Whilst the traditional WAN was originally created using fixed links between locations rented from service
providers, with the service provider having minimal management activity associated with such links, other than
ensuring that they were operational, advances in WAN technology have resulted in a shift of responsibility for

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

management onto the service provider, with the benefit to an organization of not having to deploy and manage
its own network. This means that the onus is on the service provider to ensure that its network management
facility is secure. Further, as a WAN is primarily used for routing network traffic over long distance, the routing
function should be well secured to ensure that network traffic does not get routed to the wrong destination
LAN. Thus, traffic traversing a WAN is prone to interception to those who have access to the WAN
infrastructure. Since the WAN infrastructure tends to be more accessible than a LAN, care should be
exercised to ensure that sensitive information transmitted over a WAN environment is encrypted. The service
provider should be contracted to demonstrate the level of security required by the organization.

A.2.2 Security Risks
Whilst a wired WAN shares the same primary security risks with a wired LAN (see Clause A.1 above), it has
more security risks as there is greater exposure of network traffic in a WAN network, meaning that controls,
including for access, should be in place to ensure that a wired WAN cannot be easily compromised thereby
causing widespread disruption. Similarly, whilst a wireless WAN shares the same primary security risks with a
wireless LAN (see Clause A.3 below), it is more prone to disruption due to the possibilities for the jamming of
the system used for the transmission of network packets. Overall, the key security risks related to WANs
include those associated with:
− intrusion, where information is disclosed or the integrity and/or availability of data cannot then be
guaranteed,
− DoS attacks, where resources become unavailable to authorized users,
− extended latency, which will have an effect on services such as voice over IP services,
− jitter on the network, which will affect such as voice quality (caused primarily through the use of copper
cables to deliver service),
− device failure,
− cable failure,
− unpatched devices,
− loss of power at a transit site, which affect many others,
− service provider’s network management facilities.

A.2.3 Security Controls
The security controls required to secure a WAN should include:
− use of secure management protocols such as SSH,SCP or SNMPv3,
− encryption of management links,
− encryption of network traffic,
− implementation of secure authentication to access the WAN devices, with appropriate alarming of devices,
− securing the physical WAN equipment at each site, such as using locked cabinets with access alarms,
− the use of UPS to ensure against disruption of power supplies,
− dual connected sites, using diverse routes,
− proactive polling of WAN devices,

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

− network device mapping to identify unauthorized devices,
− patch management,
− encrypted overlays for sensitive data,
− obtaining service guarantees from the service provider, such as for availability, latency and jitter,
− implementation of auditing and accounting for access to WAN devices,
− the use of firewalls that discard any unexpected traffic coming into the network,
− making sure that the infrastructure and addresses are hidden,
− assigning IP addresses that cannot be routed over the Internet,
− the use of software to prevent malicious code, such as Trojans, viruses, spyware and worms, from opening
security holes from inside a network,
− the use of IDS to identify suspicious traffic,
− ensuring that the network management systems are logically secure,
− Out of band network management,
− ensuring that the network management locations are physically secure,
− ensuring the devices are backed up,
− performing reliability checks on network management staff.

A.3 Wireless Networks
A.3.1 Background
Wireless networks are specified as networks covering geographically small areas and using non wire-based
communication means such as radio waves or infrared. Typically, wireless networks are used to implement
equivalent connectivity as provided in LANs and are therefore also called WLANs. The main technologies
used are standardized in IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth. It is emphasized that wireless networks constitute a
different category of network from radio networks, such as GSM, 3G and VHF, as those utilize aerial masts for
transmission (see Clause A.4 below). In addition, infra-red connections and any other kind of connection
supporting wireless connections should be taken into account as a sub-part of wireless network connection
considerations.
WLANs suffer from all the vulnerabilities of wired LANs, plus some specific vulnerabilities related to the
wireless link characteristics. Some specific technologies (mostly based on encryption) have been developed
to address these additional vulnerabilities, although earlier versions of these technologies (e.g. WEP) had
architectural weaknesses and thus did not meet the expectations regarding confidentiality requirements.

A.3.2 Security Risks
The key security risks related to the use of WLANs include those associated with:
− eavesdropping,
− unauthorized access,
− interference and jamming,

− misconfiguration,
− secure access mode is off by default,
− insecure encryption protocols,
− insecure management protocols used to manage WLANs,
− it is not always possible to identify WLAN users,
− rogue devices (e.g. at access points).

A.3.3 Security Controls
The controls needed for WLANs could include:
− configure the infrastructure with appropriate technical security measures (including, for example, firewalling
the WLAN from the corporate infrastructure),
− encrypt communications and data exchanged, e.g. by implementing an IPsec based VPN over the WLAN
between the client and a perimeter firewall,
− giving consideration to improving the security of each WLAN device, by configuring personal firewalls and
intrusion detection and anti-malicious code (including anti-virus) software on the client device,
− use authentication,
− control of transmission levels to eliminate a spread outside an organization’s physical domain,
− SNMP configured for read only access,
− audit log collection and analysis to detect any corruption or unauthorized usage,
− Out of Band encrypted management, for example using SSH,
− maintaining physical security to wireless access points,
− hardening of any network elements,
− system testing,
− giving consideration to deploying an IDS between the corporate network and the wireless network.

A.4 Radio Networks
A.4.1 Background
Radio Networks are specified as networks using radio waves as a connection medium to cover geographically
wide areas. Typical examples of radio networks are mobile phone networks using technologies such as GSM
or UMTS and providing public available voice and data services.
It is emphasized that networks using radio waves to cover small areas are considered as a different category
and are referred to in Clause A.3 above.

Examples of radio networks include:
− TETRA,
− GSM,
− 3G (including UMTS),
− GPRS,
− CDPD,
− CDMA.

A.4.2 Security Risks
The key security risks related to the use of radio networks in general include those associated with:
− eavesdropping,
− session hijacking,
− impersonation,
− application level threats, e.g. fraud,
− denial of service.
The security risks related to GSM include those associated with the facts that:
− A5/x algorithms and Comp128-1 are weak,
NOTE

proprietary algorithm that was initially used by default in SIM cards

− generally GSM encryption is turned off,
− SIM cloning is a reality.
The security risks related to 3G include those associated with the facts that the:
− phones are liable to electronic attack, including the insertion of malicious code, for example viruses,
− opportunities for attack are high because phones are often always on,
− service could be subject to eavesdropping,
− radio network could be jammed,
− insertion of false base stations is possible,
− gateways could be subject to unauthorized access,
− service could be subject to attack and unauthorized access via the Internet,
− introduction of spam is possible,
− management systems could be subject to unauthorized access via RAS,
− service could be attacked via lost or stolen engineering support equipment, including laptops.

UMTS is a key member of the global family of 3G mobile technologies and provides significant capacity and
broadband capabilities to support greater numbers of voice and data customers It uses a 5 MHz channel
carrier width to deliver significantly higher data rates and increased capacity, providing optimum use of radio
resources, especially for operators who have been granted large, contiguous blocks of spectrum – typically
ranging from 2x10 MHz up to 2x20 MHz – to reduce the cost of deploying 3G networks. GPRS is an essential
first step towards third generation mobile networks, by enhancing the GSM network functionalities. GPRS is a
specification for data transfer on GSM networks, which allows both packet switched and circuit switched traffic
to exist in the GSM infrastructure. GPRS utilizes up to eight 9.05Kb or 13.4Kb TDMA timeslots, for a total
bandwidth of 72.4Kb or 107.2Kb. GPRS supports both TCP/IP and X.25 communications. EDGE enabled
GSM networks are able to implement EGPRS , an enhanced version of GPRS, which increases the bandwidth
of each timeslot to 60Kb. GPRS enables an ‘always-on’ Internet connection which is a potential security issue.
A GPRS network provider will usually try to elevate the security of the link by providing a firewall between the
GPRS network and the Internet, but this should be configured to allow valid services to work, and hence may
be exploited by third parties.
CDPD is a specification for supporting wireless access to the Internet and other public packet-switched
networks over cellular telephone networks. CDPD supports TCP/IP and CLNP. CDPD utilizes the RC4 stream
cipher with 40 bit keys for encryption. CDPD is defined in the IS-732 standard. The algorithm is not strong and
can be decrypted by a brute force attack.
CDMA, a form of spread-spectrum, is a family of digital communication techniques that have been used for
many years. The core principle of spread spectrum is the use of noise-like carrier waves, which have
bandwidths much wider than that required for simple point-to-point communication for the same data rate.
Digital coding technology allows CDMA to prevent eavesdropping, whether intentional or accidental. CDMA
technology splits sound into small bits that travel on a spread spectrum of frequencies. Each small bit of
conversation (or data) is identified by a digital code known only to the CDMA phone and the base station. This
means that virtually no other device can receive the call. Since there are millions of code combinations
available for any call, it protects against eavesdropping.

A.4.3 Security Controls
There are a number of technical security controls to manage the risks from identified threats to radio networks,
that could include those for:
− secure authentication,
− encryption with effective algorithms,
− protected base stations,
− firewalls,
− malicious code (Virus, Trojans, etc.) protection,
− anti-spam.

A.5 Broadband Networks
A.5.1 Background
Broadband networks can be from a group of technologies which allow individual subscribers high speed
access to an Internet point-of-presence. Examples of broadband technologies are:
− 3G,
− Cable (optical, coax),
− Satellite,

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

− xDSL,
− FiOS,
− BPL,
− FTTH.
For xDSL, there are two main types. There is asymmetric (ADSL), where the upload speed from the user is
lower (quarter to half of the download speed), and symmetric (SDSL), where the upload and download speeds
are the same. In either case, the download speed is typically from 128 kbps to 2-8 Mbps, depending on the
product. Cable and satellite technologies also have similar types of product.
The main reasons for adopting broadband technologies are that they are a high-speed, always on technology
available more cheaply that conventional communications, and can support bandwidth intensive applications
(for example, HDTV requires 15-20 Meg at current compressions). All technologies allow access to the
Internet and hence span only from the Internet to the subscriber’s premises. Use of the Internet as a universal
carrier allows links to other sites to be constructed speedily and cheaply, perhaps with the deployment of
VPNs for secure links.

A.5.2 Security Risks
Broadband is simply an ‘always on’ high-speed link between a subscriber and the Internet. These features
make the subversion of a broadband-connected system a valuable proposition for hackers. The key security
risks related to the use of Broadband include those associated with:
− disclosure, modification or deletion of information, as a result of unauthorized remote access,
− propagation of malicious code,
− upload/download and execution of unauthorized code,
− identity theft,
− misconfiguration of client systems,
− introduction of software vulnerabilities,
− network congestion,
− DoS.

A.5.3 Security Controls
There are a number of technical security controls to manage the risks from identified threats to broadband
communications, which could include:
− Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) Firewalls,
− encryption of data,
− anti-malicious code (including anti-virus) software,
− IDS, including IPS,
− VPNs,
− Software Updates/Patching.

A.6 Security Gateways
A.6.1 Background
A suitable security gateway arrangement should protect the organization’s internal systems and securely
manage and control the traffic flowing across it, in accordance with a documented security gateway service
access policy (see Clause A.6.3 below).

A.6.2 Security Risks
Every day, hackers become more sophisticated in their attempts to breach business networks and the
gateway is a centre of interest. Attempts at unauthorized access can be malicious, such as that leading to a
DoS attack, they may be to misuse resources, or could be to gain valuable information. The gateway needs to
protect the organization from such intrusions from the outside world, such as from the Internet or third party
networks. Unmonitored content leaving the organization introduces legal issues and a potential loss of
intellectual property. In addition, as more organizations are connecting to the Internet to meet their
organizational requirements, they are faced with the need to control access to inappropriate or objectionable
Web sites. Without that control, organizations risk productivity losses, liability exposure, and misallocation of
bandwidth due to non-productive Web surfing. Thus the key security risks to be addressed include those
associated with:
− the connections to the outside world becoming unavailable,
− data becoming corrupted,
− valuable company assets being subject to unauthorized disclosure,
− data placed on websites or otherwise transmitted without proper authority incurring legal penalties, e.g.
insider trading.

A.6.3 Security Controls
A security gateway should:
− separate logical networks,
− provide restricting and analyzing functions on the information which passes between the logical networks,
− be used by an organization as a means of controlling access to and from the organization’s network,
− provide a controlled and manageable single point of entry to a network,
− enforce an organization’s security policy, regarding network connections,
− provide a single point for logging.
For each security gateway a separate service access (security) policy document should be developed and the
content implemented to ensure that only the traffic authorized is allowed to pass. This document should
contain the details of the ruleset that the gateway is required to administer, and the configuration of the
gateway. It could be possible to define permitted connections separately according to communications
protocol and other details. Thus, in order to ensure that only valid users and traffic gain access from
communications connections, the policy should define and record in detail the constraints and rules applied to
traffic passing into and out of the security gateway, and the parameters for its management and configuration.
With all security gateways, full use should be made of available identification and authentication, logical
access control and audit facilities. In addition, they should be checked regularly for unauthorized software
and/or data and, if such is found, incident reports should be produced in accordance with the organization
and/or community’s information security incident management scheme (see ISO/IEC 27035).

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

It is emphasized that the connection to a network should only take place after it is checked that the selected
security gateway suits the requirements of the organization and/or community, and that all risks resulting from
such a connection can be managed securely. It should be ensured that by-passing the security gateway is not
possible.
A firewall is a good example of a security gateway. Firewalls should normally be those that have achieved an
appropriate assurance level commensurate with the assessed risks, with the standard firewall ruleset usually
beginning by denying all access between the internal and external networks, and adding explicit rules to
satisfy only the required communications paths.
Further detail on security gateways is provided in ISO/IEC 27033-4 (as well as ISO/IEC 27002 and
ISO/IEC 27005).
Note that whilst the network security aspects of personal firewalls, a special type of firewall, are not discussed
in 27033-4, they should also be considered. Unlike most central sites which are protected by dedicated
firewalls, remote systems may not warrant the expense and specialist skills to support these devices. Instead,
a personal firewall can be used, which controls the flow of communications into (and sometimes out of) the
remote computer. The administration of the rules (policies) of the firewall can be carried out remotely by
personnel at the central site, relieving the remote system user of the requirement of technical understanding.
However if this is not possible, care should be taken to ensure effective configuration, especially if those at the
remote site are not IT literate. Some personal firewalls can also restrict the ability to transmit over the network
to authorized programs (or even libraries), restricting the ability of malware to spread.

A.7 Virtual Private Networks
A.7.1 Background
A VPN is a private network which is implemented by using the infrastructure of existing networks. From a user
perspective a VPN behaves like a private network, and offers similar functionality and services. A VPN can be
used in various situations, such as to:
− implement remote access to an organization from mobile or off-site employees,
− link different locations of an organization together, including redundant links to implement a fall-back
infrastructure,
− set up connections to an organization’s network for other organizations/business partners.
In other words, VPNs allow two computers or networks to communicate over a medium such as the Internet.
This communication has traditionally been performed at great expense by using leased lines with link
encryptors. However with the advent of high-speed Internet links and suitable termination equipment at each
end, reliable communications between sites can be established using VPNs.

A.7.2 Security Risks
The key security risk related to communications over an insecure network is that associated with sensitive
information potentially being accessible to unauthorized parties - leading to unauthorized disclosure and/or
modification. In addition to the security risks typically related to local and wide area networks (see Clauses A.1
and A.2 above respectively), the typical security risks related to VPNs include those associated with:
− insecure implementation through:
− an untested or defective cipher suite,
− a weak shared secret that could be easily guessed,
− poor network topology,
− uncertainty about the security of the remote client,
− uncertainty about the authentication of users,

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

− uncertainty about the security of the underlying service provider,
− poor performance or availability of service,
− non compliance with regulatory and legislative requirements on the use of encryption in certain countries.

A.7.3 Security Controls
In VPNs, cryptographic techniques are commonly used and/or application protocols to implement security
functionality and services, especially if the network on which the VPN is built is a public network (for example,
the Internet). In most implementations the communications links between the participants are encrypted to
ensure confidentiality, and authentication protocols are used to verify the identity of the systems connected to
the VPN. Typically, the encrypted information travels through a secure ‘tunnel’ that connects to an
organization’s gateway, with the confidentiality and integrity of the information maintained. The gateway then
identifies the remote user and lets the user access only the information they are authorized to receive.
Thus, a VPN is a mechanism based on protocol tunneling – treatment of one complete protocol (the client
protocol) as a simple stream of bits and wrapping it up in another (the carrier protocol). Normally, the VPN
carrier protocol provides security (confidentiality and integrity) to the client protocol(s). In considering the use
of VPNs, the architectural aspects that should be addressed include:
− endpoint security,
− termination security,
− malicious software protection,
− strong authentication,
− intrusion detection,
− security gateways (including firewalls),
− encryption of data,
− network design,
− other connectivity,
− split tunneling,
− audit logging and network monitoring,
− technical vulnerability management.
Further detail on VPNs, including on each of these architectural aspects, is provided in ISO/IEC 27033-5.

A.8 Voice Networks
A.8.1 Background
There are PABXs available today that support traditional channel connected telephony to the PSTN. Call setup information is passed between them using DPNSS (an industry standard interface defined between a
PABX and an access network). DPNSS expands the facilities normally only available between extensions on
a single PABX to all extensions on PABXs that are connected together in a private network. However, some
years ago a new protocol was developed alongside DPNSS to both communicate between PABXs and to
communicate between the PABX and the PSTN. This relates to an architecture for private ISDNs and an interexchange signaling protocol based upon the ISDN concepts specified in ITU-T Recommendations. The interexchange protocol, based on ITU-T Recommendation Q.931, has become known as QSIG. The signaling

protocols are robust and have not caused any security issues, but there are a number of security risks
associated with traditional PABX telephone systems.

A.8.2 Security Risks
The security risks related to traditional telephony include those associated with:
− lack of back-up controls of site specific information, that could affect availability in certain circumstances,
− eavesdropping, if physical access can be gained to cabling,
− with the management ports liable to unauthorized intrusion as they are poorly protected with simple dial
back systems, this could result in a PABX being re-programmed and used for fraud, or shut down),
− dial-through fraud, because the inter trunk barring tables are often poorly maintained thus permitting calls
to be manually routed through a network and then sent out to the PSTN (in a number of cases this
circumstance has resulted in major dial through fraud to premium rate numbers – with significant financial
loss,
− fraud through ineffectual trunk to trunk barring allowing unauthorized call diversion and call set-up (with the
fraud achieved using an associated voice messaging system to redirect calls out to the PSTN),
− lack of resilience and/or capacity, that could affect availability.

A.8.3 Security Controls
The security controls for voice networks could include ensuring that:
− it is not possible to gain physical access to cabling, junction boxes and frames,
− trunk to trunk barring tables are properly used to prevent unauthorized call routing,
− user access to routing codes is not possible,
− frequent system back-ups are taken, with copies taken and stored off site,
− PABXs are configured with multiple processors so that there are no single points of failure,
− battery or UPS power supplies are provided,
− multiple routes to the PSTN are provided, as relevant with selected fall-back analogue telephone lines for
emergency use,
− strong authentication is used on all management channels (that may mean the use of additional third party
equipment),
− dial-through fraud cannot be achieved, either through the use of unauthorized routing or via associated
voice messaging systems,
− anti-spam devices,
− a call analysis system is installed and call costs are regularly checked,
− compliance reviews and testing of services are regularly carried out, and the results acted upon.
It is worth noting that ‘traditional’ PABX telephone systems are becoming obsolescent, and are either being
partially migrated to, or replaced by, VoIP systems (see Clause 11.10 below).

A.9 IP Convergence
A.9.1 Background
As IP (data voice and video) convergence gains popularity, the security issues should be recognized and
addressed. Although current telephony implementations require security controls to deter toll fraud and other
security incidents, these systems are not integrated into the corporate data network and are not subject to the
same risks as those associated with IP data networks. With the convergence of voice and data, security
controls need to be implemented to reduce the risks associated with attacks.
A VoIP application typically consists of proprietary software hosted on open or commercially available
hardware and operating systems. The number of servers depends on vendor implementation as well as the
actual deployment. These components communicate via IP over Ethernet and are interconnected via switches
and/ or routers.

A.9.2 Security Risks
The main areas of security risks can be associated with IP-based attacks on vendor-specific software
vulnerabilities and the hardware or operating system platform hosting the VoIP application. The security risks
related to VoIP components include those associated with attacks on network-based devices and applications,
and can be enabled or facilitated by vulnerabilities in the design or implementation of the VoIP solution. The
key security risks related to IP Convergence include those associated with:
− QoS – without an overall QoS there could be a loss of quality, or interruption of calls due to packet loss,
and propagation delay across the network,
− unavailability of service due to DoS attacks, or changes to routing tables,
− integrity and availability can be affected by malicious code (including viruses) which can manage to enter
the network through insecure VoIP systems that can degrade or even create a loss of service, and could
spread to servers in the network, leading to damaged data storage,
− Spam over IP Telephony (SPIT),
− softphones on client PCs are a substantial risk as these could be an entry point for malicious code
(including viruses) and intrusions,
− VoIP servers and VoIP management systems are at risk if not protected behind firewalls,
− data network security could be degraded due to multiple ports being opened on the firewalls to support
VoIP. A VoIP session has numerous protocols and port numbers associated. H.323 uses numerous
protocols for signaling, and both H.323 and SIP use RTP. The result is that a H.323 session can use up to
eleven different ports,
− fraud is a key issue with telephony, and the risks can increase if security is not addressed when VoIP is
used. Hackers could gain unauthorized access to the VoIP service by spoofing, replay attacks, or
connection hijacking. Toll fraud, or unauthorized calls to premium rate numbers, could then result in
substantial losses,
− breaches of confidentiality can occur through the interception of communications., such as man-in-themiddle, is possible within the network by employees and other staff with access to the network,
− eavesdropping of voice calls,
− since IP telephones require power to operate, the telephone network can not be operational in the case of
power failure,
− there is a greater likelihood of failure of both voice and data services due to the use of common
components, e.g. a LAN.

A.9.3 Security Controls
There are a number of technical security controls to manage the risks from identified threats to converged IP
networks, which could include:
− QoS facilities should be implemented in a converged network, otherwise voice quality is likely to suffer.
Network service delivery, and where possible, IP links should be delivered to a site over fiber to ensure
that jitter (which affects voice quality) is minimized,
− all VoIP servers should be configured with malicious software protection,
− PC supporting softphones should be fitted with personal firewalls and the anti-malicious code (including
anti-virus) checking software should be frequently updated,
− VoIP servers and VoIP management systems should be protected behind firewalls to safeguard them from
attack,
− usage of dedicated VLANs for each service, and encryption of different data flows,
− designers should ensure that only the minimum number of ports are opened on firewalls to support VoIP
services,
− to combat toll fraud anti spoofing, anti replay controls need to be implemented to prevent connection
hijacking,
− all access to management servers should be authenticated,
− IDS should be considered for servers supporting VoIP services,
− encryption of the data path should be considered where sensitive information is to be discussed over a
VoIP network,
− IP phones should be powered by switches supported by UPS,
− there may be a need to provide a conventional voice service, which has an independent power source for
use in an emergency.

A.10 Web Hosting
A.10.1 Background
Web hosting services are offered by many network service providers in the form of a standardized service,
often including database facilities for handling persistent data as well as a basic application runtime
environment. Although most of the components needed to implement and offer web hosting services are out
of scope for this standard (such as web server or database software), some considerations about the whole
service itself are documented here as many people consider web hosting as an integral part of a network
offering.
Web hosting sites are at risk from a variety of threats, particularly where they are connected to the Internet, for
example where prominent organizations may be under attack from fringe groups. Thus, it is important that all
potential threats are identified, and then all vulnerabilities which could be exploited by the threats are closed
off. This is best achieved by designing out vulnerabilities. By addressing these issues in accordance with the
guidance provided, it should be possible to design a web site, which is secure, reliable and has a low
likelihood of being defaced.

A.10.2 Security Risks
The key security risks related to web hosting include those associated with:
− access by an attacker to application and data with a single breach of the perimeter protection,
− exposure to vulnerabilities in infrastructure component,
− multiple single points of failure,
− loss of service due to hardware failure,
− inability for to be taken out of service for maintenance,
− unintended access by public users to areas where data is stored,
− attacks against data integrity (e.g. web site defacement or hosting unauthorized content),
− malware being uploaded into the system,
− compromise of a web site using switching functionality,
− inability to take backups without affecting web site performance,
− unauthorized disclosure of an IP addressing plan facilitating attack on the web site,
− exploitation of connections between management stations and the Web site,
− undiscovered attack,
− difficulty in tracking intrusions between devices,
− inability to recover data,
− inability to meet service level agreement requirements,
− inability to maintain continuity of service,
− unauthorized use of web services, including violation of organization policy (e.g. using servers for own
benefits) and non-compliance with legislation and regulation (e.g. storing material which violates copyright
or storing child pornography).

A.10.3 Security Controls
The technical security controls to manage the risks from identified threats for web sites could include:
− the provision of zoning and security in depth to limit the effect of a successful attack,
− the specification of different firewall types to counter possible firewall vulnerabilities. (Further information
on firewalls is provided in Clause A.6 above and ISO/IEC 27033-4.),
− resilience; the design should be examined for potential single points of failure and these should be
eliminated,
− failover/load sharing to guard against equipment failure,
− clustering where high availability in a 24x7 environment is a requirement,
− proxying services to limit access into a web site and to enable a high degree of logging,
− regular integrity checks for unauthorized changes to data,

− anti-malicious code (including anti-virus) controls on uploads to prevent the import of malware,
− layer 2 switching normally used in a web site design. Layer 3 switching should not be used unless it is a
business related requirements, such as for load sharing. In addition the same physical switch should not
be used either side of a firewall. Test points should be included in the switch design,
− VLANs segregated by function to enable IDS to be more easily tuned as there is a reduced protocol set on
any VLAN. In addition, the implementation of a backup VLAN will allow backups to operate at any time of
the day without compromising the performance of the site,
− as relevant to business operations, the IP addressing plan to limit the number of public addresses to a
minimum, with the IP addressing plan kept “in strictest confidence” as knowledge of it could be used to
mount an attack on the web site,
− where management links are connected over public networks, they should be encrypted (see
ISO/IEC 27033-4 for further information on remote access). This includes at least alerts/ SNMP traps on
console port connections,
− all transaction and event logs from each device copied to an audit server, and then copied to a backup
media, such as a CD,
− a time synchronization service implemented as it is key to analyzing unauthorized access and being able
to follow the traces through the log files. This requires that the timing of all log files, and hence servers, is
synchronized to plus/ minus 1 second or lower. (NTP is relevant here; for further information see
ISO/IEC 27002, Clause 10.6.),
− LAN devices configured to control unmanaged changes to MAC addresses,
− a centralized backup service, preferred as this is more likely to be performed as required,
− with web sites needed in most cases to be operating 24 hours per day, this requires high quality hardware
that can withstand the environment. The server infrastructure in a web site should be specified to support
“24 x 7” operations. The supporting operating systems should be hardened, and all servers and other
devices should then undergo security testing to ensure that all devices are fully hardened,
− robust application software implemented, where code has been checked for structure, that is logically
correct, and uses approved authentication software.
It should also be noted that business continuity management issues are often not fully considered when
designing a web site. Full business continuity management activities should be conducted in relation to web
sites.

A.11 Internet E-Mail
A.11.1 Background
The opening up of Internet services to an organization/community to meet legitimate business requirements
brings with it a variety of threats which can be used to exploit vulnerable systems. Thus, Internet e-mail can be
at risk from a variety of threats, and the target is to design and implement a solution that is secure and
reliable. Figure 7 below shows an example potential solution for Internet e-mail.

Figure A.1 — Example Internet E-mail Solution
Internet (SMTP) mail systems are fairly simple to deal with in a network technical security architecture as they
only have to check and forward mail that has been received. The information to be gathered should include:
− the expected number of messages per day in each direction,
− the type of message and content of the messages that are to be permitted,
− the number and size of messages per day in each direction,
− the average and maximum sizes of messages permitted,
− details of the internal mail system,
− details of the internal mail relay, which will communicate with the mail relay defined in the technical security
architecture,
− details of the external mail system(s) (which could be with any mail relay on the Internet, or it could be one
specific mail server owned by a service provider),
− details of the mail server authentication requirements for internal communications, and to Internet mail
communications,
− details of internal WINS/DNS facilities,
− details of DNS facilities for the Internet,
− if relevant, what access to newsgroups is required and if so are there to be any restrictions placed on what
newsgroups can be accessed,
− whether mail/server time synchronization will be required from the Internet,
− whether there is to be more than one route to the Internet,
− requirements for scanning for malicious code (including viruses).

A.11.2 Security Risks
The key security risks related to Internet e-mail include those associated with:
− unauthorized intrusions into an organization’s/community’s network. Attempts at unauthorized access,
including by identity impersonation, could be made 24 h per day, are becoming more sophisticated and
creative and can be malicious such as leading to a DoS attack, misusing resources or gaining valuable
information,
− uploading of malicious code, which could include the introduction of a Trojan that collects information such
as passwords and sends these back out to a remote location or facilitates taking over control of a remote
device. Thus, attention should be paid to the more recent ‘blended’ threats where malicious code contains
a ‘payload’,
− upload of spam (spam is a significant threat to e-mail services – it can adversely affect e-mail activities by
consuming network resources to route spams and also system resources for mail gateways, and can be
used to propagate malware),
− relaying of spam (if a mail server was configured to allow anonymous mail relay, it could be used by
spammers to send spam via the Internet in the name of the organization owning the mail server),
− e-mail spoofing (it is very easy to impersonate the identity of any user to pretend to be someone sending email),
− content forging,
− unmonitored content leaving the organization without the knowledge of information security personnel,
which introduces legal implications and potential losses of intellectual property,
− direct DoS attack against the mail system,
− distributed DoS attack where thousands of e-mails are sent from multiple locations to overwhelm the mail
server.

A.11.3 Security Controls
The security controls for Internet e-mail could include:
− firewalls used that have assurance levels and rule sets appropriate to the assessed risks. For most
security purposes, the initial firewall rule set should be to deny the passage of all traffic across the firewall.
For e-mail, it is normal for an e-mail server to send data out to the Internet and to receive incoming data
from the Internet. Here, the firewall rule set would be set up to allow the two-way sending of e-mail data.
As mentioned earlier, it is advisable to have two firewalls in series that are from different vendors or have
different operating systems,
− filing and audit capabilities supported by a fully synchronized time service across all infrastructure
components, firewalls and servers. This time synchronization must be addressed in the design, with a
description of the master clock and a hierarchy plan for servers and network(s). Often the master clock will
be synchronized via either a satellite global positioning service (GPS) or a terrestrial radio time service,
− the Internet (SMTP) mail transport system properly established to fulfil the required security related tasks,
including the provision of the interface to the organization/community from the Internet, the transfer of mail
from the Internet to the internal mail server and vice versa, the prevention of the relay of mail from the
Internet to another addressee on the Internet, and assurance that mail and attachments are malicious code
free regardless of the direction,
− for any incoming mail, as a result of a look-up on an Internet DNS server, messages directed to the
organization’s firewall address and, when received from the Internet checked by the outer router for a
source address field outside of the internal address space before being directed to the firewall. At the
firewall, the message should be checked for an address field outside the internal address space and the

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

destination address of the mail server (and of course that it was an e-mail), and then be directed to the
SMTP mail server. At the SMTP mail server, the message should be checked that it was from the Internet
and that the destination address was for an internal address, and then be directed to the external antimalicious code server for checking for viruses and any other malicious content. Finally, it should then be
sent to the internal mail server for distribution by the internal mail system. Any messages received with an
incorrect address should be rejected and an entry included in the log. Any message received with a virus
or other malicious content should be quarantined and the appropriate person or group informed,
− for any outgoing mail, messages forwarded via the Internet should first be sent from the internal mail
server to the external anti-malicious code server for checking for viruses and any other malicious content
before being sent to the external SMTP mail server for direction to the Internet. The external SMTP mail
server should check that the address is outside the internal address space and that it was not destined for
any other mail routes, and then forward the message to the Internet,
− choosing one of the two options of the external SMTP mail server sending the message to a single ISP
mail server for onward routing or to any valid mail address on any mail server. The first option should be
the most secure as it means that the (presumably mail expert) ISP is responsible for organizing and
supporting the forwarding of mail, but could introduce delays in mail transmission. The second option is
much more flexible and would not incur delays due to ISP forwarding, but it could be less secure if not
properly managed – with the organization/community having to support mail to many mail servers and
running the risk of rejection if its mail relay is not recognized by the remote mail server, albeit that this
could be overcome by authentication procedures between the corresponding mail servers. Which option is
chosen depends on the technical merits of the solution and the level of expertise of those that will support
the mail system,
− access control measures implemented based on the principle of least privilege,
− the e-mail server configured to block or remove e-mails that contain file attachments that are commonly
used to spread malicious code, such as: .vbs, .bat, .exe, .pif and .scr files,
− infected computers being quickly removed from the network to prevent further compromise, and forensic
analysis being performed and restoration accomplished using trusted media,
− staff trained not to open attachments unless they are expecting them, and not to execute software that is
downloaded over the Internet unless it has been scanned for malicious code,
− ACLs used on routers. Router ACLs specify how to handle an incoming IP packet, with typical actions
including forward, log, and drop (or deny). Combined with the appropriate router default policy (e.g. deny
all), it is possible to define a rule set for a router which greatly assists in maintaining the security of the
underlying network,
− anti-spoofing enabled. Spoofing typically refers to the situation where the source (originating) address of a
message appears to come from someone or somewhere other than that of the true originator. Antispoofing measures take the form of not accepting the message from the Internet if it claims to have
originated from inside the organization, and vice versa (see RFC2827, Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating
Denial of Service, for more detail),
− e-mail proxies enabled. A proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary between a PC/workstation
user and the Internet so that the enterprise can ensure security, administrative control and caching service.
Security is enforced as follows:
− scanning the data for known patterns (for example, to check for sensitive words for compliance
assurance),
− translating between internal and external addresses,
− creating a log of requests and requesters,
− anti-malicious code facilities based at the proxies,

ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009(E)

The proxy servers can also check for malicious content by simply processing the request. If the request is
malicious, there is a likelihood that the proxy server itself will crash. As proxies are generally implemented
in the DMZ, a semi-trusted zone, this behaviour acts as a ‘fuse’ to protect the real requester or server,
− anti-malicious code controls implemented on e-mail proxies. Once information systems are shown to be
free of malicious code (including viruses), the only route for malicious code to be introduced is by
introduction as data (or programs). Thus, e-mail facilities are prime candidates for transmission of
malicious code, and represent prime points for the implementation of anti-malicious code controls. Typical
controls include facilities to quarantine suspicious files (for example, by content type), and screening of
requested e-mail addresses against a blacklist. Further, to deal with the more recent blended threats,
where malicious code contains a payload, blocking of certain attachments containing executable code
needs to be considered,
− anti-spam technologies deployed and users educated on protecting their e-mail addresses when accessing
sites,
− anti-relay implemented on e-mail servers and reverse DNS look-ups. One of the possible ways in which an
e-mail server can be exploited from the Internet is to send it a message which is actually destined for a
third party. Then if the e-mail server accepts the message it will be forwarded to the third party, apparently
from the organization/community rather than its true originator. This mechanism can be used by
‘spammers’ or to overwhelm the third party’s network by a DoS attack. Anti-relay controls detect if an
incoming e-mail is for the organization/community. If not, the e-mail is logged (or quarantined) and the email server takes no further action,
− alerts and SNMPv3 traps enabled. SNMP can be used for the remote control of a networked device, and
for the device to send messages (or ‘traps’) to notify a monitoring station of conditions at that device. The
protocol is relatively insecure, and tends not to be used for device control purposes. However, SNMP traps
are widely used and are transmitted via the network to notify a central location of statistics or error
conditions,
− audit management implemented. All logs pertaining to e-mail should be captured to an audit server, and
checked daily for unusual activity. This includes the logs from the firewall and the e-mail SMTP proxy. The
logs should be examined using a quality event correlation and analysis tool,
− ‘out of band’ (OOB) firewall management instituted. This refers to the practice of using different networks
for data and management to ensure it is not possible for an attacker to connect to their target device
(firewall, in this instance). Many mechanisms exist to implement OOB management:
− management by physical access only,
− separate management network,
− use of VLANs to create separate channels over the data network, allowing data and management traffic
to be segregated,
Otherwise management should be by physical access only.

A.12 Routed Access to Third Party Organizations
A.12.1 Background
Third party connections are on the increase as organizations move towards more collaborative working, which
requires a direct connection and gateway facilities between the organizations. Figure 8 below shows an
example technical security solution for routed access to third party organizations.

Figure A.2 — Example Routed Access to Third Party Organizations Solution

Routed access to other organizations could be made via a WAN technologies or broadband, and be required
for many reasons, e.g. access can be required to database applications in either direction – in which case
either way unauthorized code could be introduced or unauthorized access could be attempted by users within
either network to the other. The information to be gathered should include, for example:
− what applications are to be supported over the routed link,
− details of communicating servers and where they are located,
− details of the user PCs and where they are located,
− details of the third party router if it exists (including IP address, method of authentication, e.g. digital
certificates, shared secret, RADIUS, TACACS+),
− communications link type and speed, e.g. VPN over broadband, frame relay, private wire link, dial-up and
ISDN.
It is also sensible that for each third party access, a configuration document is produced, if it does not already
exist, that includes an overview of the requirement, a network diagram, configuration information and details of
IP addressing and authentication.
(When considering routed access to third party organizations it would be sensible to refer to
ISO/IEC TR 14516:1999 - Guidelines on use and management of Trusted Third Party Services.)

A.12.2 Security Risks
The key security risks related to routed access to third party organizations are principally associated with the
fact that any third party is a separate security domain with its own policies – and may not be as secure as your
organization. Thus, the key security risks related to routed access to third party organizations include those
associated with:
− unauthorized access to your network and related ‘systems’ and information,
− importation of malicious code through an apparently trusted gateway,
− DoS attack via the third party,
− a belief that the third party network offers a higher level of security than the Internet.

A.12.3 Security Controls
The security controls for routed access to third party organizations could include:
− all third party connections isolated by a different firewall to that used for the Internet and other classes of
external connections,
− anti-malicious code software in place, including that which works with the firewall to check for Java and
ActiveX code (as mentioned earlier, such code is not recognized by regular anti-malicious code (including
anti-virus) software as a virus and thus cannot be detected and checked to see if it is valid or not),
− strong token or card based authentication in place, by way of either digital certificates on key fobs or
smartcards or by two factor authentication with tokens,
− if connections are via ISDN routed access, CLID used as an additional authentication method,
− routers, including at the remote end of the connection, authenticated via an authentication server, such as
TACACS+. However, if no agreement can be reached for the method of authentication with the third party
then shared secrets can be used where there is a small deployment, which is an exchange of passwords.
For large numbers of connections, digital certificates should be used as these can be regularly changed,
− the third party router using the same means of authentication, e.g. digital certificates, shared secret,
RADIUS, TACACS+,
− routers at both ends of the link kept physically secure,
− all third party connections covered by a conditions for secure connection document that is signed by each
third party organization before any connection is permitted,
− consideration of use of IDS/IPS,
− audit and accounting implemented,
− for each third party access, a configuration document produced and agreed that includes an overview of
the requirement, a network diagram, configuration information and details of the IP addressing and
authentication method.

A.13 Intranet Data Center
A.13.1 Background
The Intranet data center houses most of the critical applications and data for the organization. The Data
Center could be a critical part of an organizations infrastructure and has unique concerns beyond those of the
other aspects of the network covered in other parts of this annex. Although storage (SANs) and the individual
host aspects in a data center are out of scope of this standard (such as hardening of servers or databases),
some considerations about the overall security of the data center are documented here.
Threats facing today IT security administrators have grown from the relatively trivial attempts to wreak havoc
on networks into sophisticated attacks aimed at profit and the theft of sensitive corporate data. Implementation
of robust data center security capabilities to safeguard sensitive mission-critical applications and data is a
cornerstone in the effort to secure enterprise networks.
Because a key responsibility of security for the data center is to maintain the availability of services, the ways
in which security affects traffic flows, scalability, and failures must be carefully considered.

A.13.2 Security Risks
Attack vectors have moved higher in the stack to subvert network protection and aim directly at applications.
HTTP-, XML-, and SQL-based attacks are useful efforts for most attackers because these protocols are
usually allowed to flow through the enterprise network and enter the intranet data center.
The following are some of the threat vectors affecting the Intranet data center:
−

unauthorized access to data,

−

unauthorized access to applications,

−

unauthorized device access,

−

interruption of critical services through DoS attacks,

−

undiscovered attacks,

−

loss of data,

−

inability to recover data,

−

targeted attacks to modify data,

−

privilege escalation,

−

installation of malware

−

unauthorized use of services, including violation of organization policy.

A.13.3 Security Controls
The technical security controls for data centers could include:
−

security gateways to control access into the data center.

−

use of IPS/IDS in the data center,

−

anti-malicious code (including anti-virus) controls on hosts,

−

secure management of infrastructure devices,

−

logging and audit capabilities supported by a fully synchronized time service across all components in
the data center,

−

a business continuity plan for failures,

−

resilient design,

Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. The
main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27033-2 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.
This first edition of ISO/IEC 27033-2 cancels and replaces ISO/IEC 18028-2:2006, which has been technically
revised.

Preparing for design of network security

6.1

Introduction

The objectives of network security are to enable the information flows that enhance an organisation’s business
processes, and to prevent information flows that degrade an organisation’s business processes. The
preparation work for the design and the implementation of network security involves the following stages:
–
–
–
–
–

Asset identification
Requirements collection
Review of requirements
Evaluation of technical options and constraints
Evaluation of existing designs and implementations

These stages should result in the early documentation consisting of all the inputs for following design and
implementation steps.

6.2

Asset identification

Identification of assets is a critical first step in determining the information security risks to any network. The
assets to be protected are those which would degrade the organization’s business processes were they to be
inappropriately disclosed, modified or unavailable. They include physical assets (servers, switches, routers,
etc), and logical assets (configuration settings, executable code, data, etc). This register of assets should
already exist as part of continutiy planning/Disaster recovery risk analysis. The questions that must be
answered are:


What are the distinct types of network equipment and facility groupings that need to be protected?



What are the distinct types of network activities that need to be protected?



What information assets and information processing capabilities need to be protected ?



Where information assets reside in the information systems architecture?

Identifiable assets include those required to securely support management, control and user traffic and the
features required for the functioning of the network infrastructure, services, and applications. These include
devices such as hosts, routers, firewalls, etc, interfaces (internal and external), information stored/processed
and protocols used. The protection of infrastructure assets is only part of the objective of the network security
design. The principle objective is the protection of business assets such as information and business
processes.

6.3
6.3.1

Requirements collection
Legal and regulatory requirements

The legal and regulatory requirements for the location and function of the network should be gathered and
reviewed to ensure that the requirements are met in the design of the network. Particular care should be taken
where information flows across jurisdictional or regulatory boundaries. In such cases, the requirements of both
sides of the boundary must be recorded.

ISO/IEC 27033-2:2012(E)

6.3.2

Business requirements

The organization’s business processes and data classification types determine its access requirements. The
network should be configured to enable this access, to and from its information assets, for suitably authorised
users, and prevent all other access. Access to Information will often relate to services on open ports (for
example HTTP on TCP port 80) specific hosts (such as www.example.org at IP address 10.11.12.13)
particular groups of hosts (for example the 172.128.97.64/24 subnet) or particular network interface devices
(such as the interface with MAC address 10:00:00:01:02:03). The organisation will need to identify those
services that it provides to others, those services that it uses of others, and those services it provides
internally.
6.3.3

Performance requirements

Traffic data is required to enable the configurations for the communication lines, servers and security
gateways/firewalls to be documented such that on implementation a good level of service can be provided in
accordance with user expectations – with no ‘over-configuration’ and related unnecessary costs. Information
should be gathered on such as the speeds of any existing communication links, configuration/capacity of
routers at any third party locations, the number of users that will be allowed access via each link (concurrent
access and number of users with access), minimum, average and maximum user connect time required,
identity of what authorized users will access over the link, number of web page hits required, database access
hits required, growth expected over one year and three/five years, and whether a Windows log-on is required.
Use could be made of telecommunications table (queuing) theory for sizing the number of ports, channels
required, particularly over dial-up links. These performance requirements should be reviewed, queries
resolved and the performance criteria required to be met by the technical architecture and related technical
security architecture formally agreed.

6.4

Review requirements

A review of the current capabilities and any planned technical network architecture changes needs to be done
and compared to the technical security architecture being developed to note any incompatibilities. Any
incompatibilities need to then be reviewed and the appropriate architectures modified.
The information to be gathered during the review should include at a minimum the following:
–

identification of the type(s) of network connection to be used,

–

determination of the security risks,

–

development of the list of required technical security architecture and security controls,

–

network protocols to be used,

–

network applications used on different aspects of the network

The information gathered should be in the context of the network capabilities. Detail should be obtained of the
relevant network architecture and this shall be reviewed to provide the necessary understanding and context
for process steps that follow. By clarifying these aspects at the earliest possible stage, the process of
identifying the relevant security requirement identification criteria, identifying control areas, and reviewing the
technical security architecture options and deciding which one shall be adopted, should become more efficient
and eventually result in more workable security solution. For example it may be that because of the location
there is only one conduit for all network connections to be established through, so even if a security control
might be to have different conduits for redundant connections, that is not possible based on the location
picked. Other controls may have to be determined then to find the best way to protect the network
connections.
The consideration of network and application architectural aspects at an early stage should allow time for
those architectures to be reviewed and possibly revised if an acceptable security solution cannot be
realistically achieved within the current architecture.

6.5

Review of existing designs and implementations

The review of the existing security controls must be conducted in the light of the results from a security risk
assessment and management review (details on risk management can be found in ISO/IEC 27005). The
results of the security risk assessment may indicate which security controls are required commensurate with
the assessed threats. A gap analysis will need to be completed against the current network security
architecture to determine what is not addressed in the existing network security architecture.
The network security architecture should encompass the existing security controls and any missing or new
security controls.

7.1

Design of network security
Introduction

The network security architecture exists to restrict traffic flowing between different trust domains. The most
obvious boundary between trust domains is the interface between an organization’s internal network and the
outside world. An organisation of any significant size will also have boundaries between internal trust domains
which must be identified and controlled. The network security architecture includes a description of the
interfaces between an organization’s/community’s internal network and the outside world. Reflecting the
requirements mentioned in clause 6.4 above and addressing how to protect the organization from the
common threats and vulnerabilities as described in ISO/IEC 27033-1.
Guidance on general best practice design is provided in clause 7.2 below, and guidance on the network
security architecture aspects related to specific networking technologies to address the requirements of today
and the near future is provided in ISO/IEC 27033-4 and onward. Guidance on specific scenarios that are
possible for an organization are covered in ISO/IEC 27033-3.
Technical assumptions made during the requirements gathering should be documented, for example:
•

only authorized IP communications should be allowed (firewalls normally only support IP communications,
and if any other protocols were allowed then it could be difficult to manage them);

•

if non-IP protocols are a requirement then they should be dealt with either outside the security architecture
or by tunnelling the protocol.

A network security architecture would normally encompass services, such as the following but not limited to
these:
•

identification and authentication (passwords, tokens, smartcards, certificates, RAS/RADIUS/terminal
access controller access control system plus (TACACS+), etc.);

•

logical access controls (single sign on, role based access control, trusted databases, application controls,
firewalls, proxy devices, etc.);

•

security audit and accounting (audit logs, audit log analysis facilities, intrusion detection facilities, write
once read many (WORM) devices, etc.);

•

assured storage clearance/secure deletion (provable ‘wipe’ facilities);

•

security testing (vulnerability scanning, network ‘sniffing’, penetration testing, etc.);

•

secure development environment (separate development and test environments, no compilers, etc.);

•

software change control (configuration management software, version control, etc.);

•

secure software distribution (digital signing, SSL, transport Layer security (TLS) (RFC 5246), etc.);

•

secure maintenance and availability (good back-up/restore facilities, resilience, clustering, data vaults,
diverse communications, etc.);

•

transmission security (use of transport encryption, spread spectrum technology, Wireless LANS (WLANs),
VPNs/extranets.

7.2.1

Design principles
Introduction

Common risk areas associated with networking security architectures are design failures due to poor design
and/or the lack of appropriate consideration of business continuity planning or the design does not correspond
to the current or expected threat level. Fundamental elements are needed to develop network security
architectures that encompass all the identified security controls and business requirements. Most of these
elements can be covered by general network security design best practices. ISO/IEC 27033-4 and onward
cover design and implementation in detail on some aspects of the network technical security architecture best
practices. Additional detailed guidance on best practice implementations can be found in other publications.
The following sections provide general guidance on design best practices to be followed when considering a
network security architecture.
7.2.2

Defence in depth

Organizations need to look at security not just from one perspective, but as a pervasive layered approach.
Security must be comprehensive across all network layers. Adopting a layered approach is considered to be
defence in depth. The components of security are a combination of policy, design, management and
technology. Each organization needs to determine its needs and design a defence in depth based upon those
needs.
Many mobile devices have USB and network connectivity, as well as wireless capability. These devices can
be connected to the internal network or systems on it in an ad-hoc manner; should this be done with the
device's wireless connectivity open and unsecured, these devices could act as a rogue wireless access point
on the internal network, bypassing the perimeter controls. Strict policies should be in place to restrict the
connection of unsecured mobile devices to the network, and routine scanning of the wireless channels should
be done to detect any rogue access points.
Any wireless access points should be in a DMZ. Those that are in the internal network should have strict
connections settings: the strongest security (WPA2 where possible), and MAC address filtering to restrict the
devices that can connect to it to those that are authorised. ISO/IEC 27033-3 provides more details on the
threats presented by mobile communications technology and the relevant controls.
The defense in depth principle represents the use of multiple security controls or security techniques to help
mitigate the risk of one component of the defense being compromised or circumvented. An example could be
anti-virus software installed on individual workstations when there is already virus protection on the firewalls
and servers within the same environment. Different security products from multiple vendors may be deployed
to defend different potential vectors within the network, helping prevent a shortfall in any one defence leading
to a wider failure; also known as a "layered approach"
Figure 1 shows how there is perimeter security, with a more finer grain for infrastructure security, still more
finer for the hosts, then applications and finally data. All of the layers are to protect the data.

Security solutions based on the layered approach are flexible and scalable. The solution is adaptable to the
security needs of the organization.
7.2.3

Network Zones

Network zoning using the concept that system resources of different sensitivity levels (i.e., different risk
tolerance values and threat susceptibility) should be located in different security zones. This creates a way to
have the systems make available only such data that is necessary for conducting the tasks (e.g., only servers
providing services to the Internet are registered in public DNS) for that particular zone.
The basic means of keeping network traffic flowing where you want and restricting it where you do not is a
security gateway: dedicated firewall devices, firewall functions in IPS devices, and access control lists in
network routers and switches.
With proper placement and configuration, security gateways help create secure architectures, dividing the
network infrastructure into security zones and controlling communication between them. Additional information
of how to place and configure security gateways can be found in ISO/IEC 27033-4.
The compartmentalization principle describes the following network security design rules:
–

–

7.2.4

Networks of different sensitivity levels should be located in different security zones:
– Devices and computer systems providing services for external networks (e.g., the Internet)
should be located in different zones (De-Militarized Zone – DMZ) than internal network
devices and computer systems.
– Strategic assets should be located in dedicated security zones.
– Devices and computer systems of low trust level such as remote access servers and
wireless network access points should be located in dedicated security zones
Networks of different types should be located in separate security zones:
– User workstations should be located in different security zones than servers
– Network and security management systems should be located in dedicated security zones
– Systems in development stage should be located in different zones than production systems
Design resilience

Network Security design should incorporate several layers of redundancy to eliminate single points of failure
and to maximize the availability of the network infrastructure. This includes the use of redundant interfaces,
backup modules, standby devices, and topologically redundant paths. In addition, the designs also use a wide
set of features destined to make the network more resilient to attacks and network failures.

7.2.5

Scenarios

A network environment under review can often be characterized by particular network scenario(s) and
‘technology’ topic(s) that are associated with well defined threats, design considerations and control issues.
Such information is very useful when reviewing technical security architecture/design options and selecting
and documenting the preferred technical security architecture/design and related security controls.
ISO/IEC 27033-3 references such scenarios, and for each scenario provides detailed guidance on the security
threats and the security design techniques and controls required to counter those threats.
7.2.6

Models and Frameworks

Historically a component of security system engineering includes selection, use or development of a security
model or framework.
The security model is used to describe the entities (subjects governed by an organization’s security policy)
and define the access rules necessary to instantiate said policy. The security model typically focuses on either
confidentiality via access controls or information integrity, where some are formally defined and others
informally defined.
Security frameworks typically provide an organization a way to form a general outline of how to form a secure
system. An example of a framework would be ITU-T X.805. This overarching framework for the ITU-T X.800
series of recommendations to fit into to provide end-to-end network security. To this end, X.805 defines the
concept of security dimensions that are containers for tools, technologies, standards, regulations, procedures,
etc. that span either aspects of security. X.805 recognizes that redundant security mechanisms are avoided
by identifying security capabilities in one layer that protect another layer, (Layer here is used in the context of
X.805) thus reducing the overall cost of a security solution. X.805 is a generic security framework and as such
does not provide a specification for any particular information system or component. Rather it specifies
security principles and target security capabilities facilitating end-to-end network security. An example of how
ITU-T X.805 can be applied in support of ISO/IEC 27001 controls can be found in Annex C.

8.2

Criteria for Network component selection

For any secure network design there is a combination of common components that can be used. These
components are used in a combination that will create a technical network security design. The remainder of
clause 8 and ISO/IEC 27033-3 and onward go into technical detail on some of the components listed below.
These components will be used in some combination to secure the requirements reflected in clause 6.4.
Some of these components may include:

8.3



Segmentation and compartmentalization



Security Management systems (e.g. monitoring and configuration management)



Basic Security technologies, such as Identity management, cryptography, etc.



Network admission control devices



Threat mitigation techniques



Perimeter devices



Network filters such as firewalls and content inspection services Remote-access devices



Intrusion detection systems/Intrusion prevention systems



Endpoint protection



Routers and switches



Extranet connections

Criteria for product or vendor selection

Product selection should not be undertaken in isolation, but conducted as an iterative process associated with
the design of the network security architecture.
Some examples of what product selection should be based on include:
–

technical suitability and merit of the product;

–

performance;

–

protocol support;

–

resilience;

–

compatibility;

–

extensibility;

–

network management facilities;

–

audit capability;

–

8.4

Network management

Network management refers to the activities, methods, procedures, and tools that pertain to the operation,
administration, maintenance and provisioning of networked systems.


Operation deals with keeping the network (and the services that the network provides) up and running
smoothly. It includes monitoring the network to spot problems as soon as possible, ideally before
users are affected.



Administration deals with keeping track of resources in the network and how they are assigned. It
includes all the "housekeeping" that is necessary to keep the network under control.



Maintenance is concerned with performing repairs and upgrades - for example, when equipment must
be replaced, when a router needs a patch for an operating system image, when a new switch is added
to a network. Maintenance also involves corrective and preventive measures to make the managed
network run "better", such as adjusting device configuration parameters.

Misconfiguration of network related components, either intentional or deliberate, impose significant risks, not
only regarding availability, but often also regarding integrity and confidentiality.
Therefore controls to address these risks are necessary. Such controls can be categorized in organizational
controls or technical controls.
Organizational controls can include proper entitlement of administrative personal, operational principles such
as four eyes principle, appropriate separation of duties as wells as procedures and policies to avoid default or
weak passwords. Operational controls can include configuration and version control to address potential
misconfiguration or tracking changes in the configuration of devices.
Technical controls include the use of administration interfaces and tools which provide appropriate
authentication and authorisation quality and confidentiality. Technical management is required for a number of
networking related components. Security gateways could be managed locally or remotely, but remote
management should use tools which ensure strong or two-factor authentication or at least technically avoid
default or weak passwords and which provide adequate integrity and confidentiality functions would be used
whenever possible. Examples are the use of encrypted VPN tunnels configured with appropriate levels of
encryption or SSH terminal emulation. Servers could also be managed locally or remotely. Where the servers
support sensitive information then again the remote management must use tools which ensure strong or twofactor authentication or at least technically avoid default or weak passwords and which provide adequate
integrity and confidentiality functions would be used whenever possible.
Infrastructure components, such as switches and routers, could be managed locally from the console port,
remotely from a central management station, using terminal emulation program to work online on a remote
computer or from distributed management system. However, it is recognized that these protocols are not
secure unless they can be configured with a method that can fully encrypt the connection. One example of
secure remote connection which can fully encrypted and includes a secure file transfer facility is SSH. Further,
access to infrastructure components should be controlled by an authentication server.

ISO/IEC 27033-2:2012(E)

Networks that are outsourced to a provider normally have their own management systems. However, they
should be managed from a central management station using secure remote management methods. Remote
management methods should include encryption and authentication using public key cryptography. Examples
of secured methods that could be used are, Telnet and TFTP via a VPN tunnel, or SSH, which is controlled by
an authentication server.
Many organizations use simple network management protocol (SNMP) management traps to directly monitor
such networks. There are significant risks with SNMP version 1 and version 2 that have weak or no security.
Therefore if an organization decides to use SNMP the use should be using version 3 with full security controls.

Logging, monitoring and incident response

An audit server should be configured with all security gateway systems, located on a DMZ that is secure from
both the outside and the inside networks as well as any other security relevant devices located inside or
outside the DMZ. The audit server should not be part of the internal network domain and should only be
directly accessible by an assigned security officer for the security gateway/firewall system. However, write
access will be needed to allow audit logs to be uploaded by a secure protocol (for example Secure Copy
Protocol (SCP)) from infrastructure components, servers and firewalls. All firewall and associated audit logs
should be directed to this audit server for later examination by security staff, with audit analysis software
provided to allow review of the audit log files.
Security information management includes the collection and standardization of information collected so that
decisions can be made based on that information. Information collected may include syslogs, SNMP
information, IDS/IPS alerts, and flow information.
Where possible, the audit server and or IDS/IPS systems should be configured to alert an assigned security
officer by email, SMS, or both according to the priority level of any detected abnormal activity. Should any
abnormal activity be detected that could constitute an attempted attack, the assigned security officer should
implement incident response procedures according to the priority level of the alert. Information security
incident management is covered in more detail in ISO/IEC 27035.

8.6

Documentation

The network security architecture document is one of the critical technical security document and, as stated
earlier, should be compatible with the related security risk assessment and risk management review results,
organization/community networking and information security policies, and other security policies as relevant.
As with any critical documentation these documents should be kept under change control. An example
template is given in Annex B.1. It should reference the related technical architecture documentation and other
technical security documents. Key related documents include:
–

Documentation on information security requirements for all managed network components (such as
Gateways, Firewalls, Routers etc.). These requirements include also functional security requirements
such as Firewall rule base requirements.– see Annex B.2 for an example template;

–

audit log analysis software requirements documentation;

–

product analysis reports.

8.7

Test plans and conducting testing

A security testing strategy document should be developed that describes the approach to be taken with testing
to prove the networking technical security architecture. It should concentrate on how the key technical security
controls should be tested to verify that the defined requirements are met, and that policies are implemented as
designed. To verify these viewpoints, system test and checklist-based checking are conducted.
The testing strategy document should include areas such as:
– identification and authentication mechanisms

– resilience of design
– authorisation mechanisms
– implementation of policy controls
– verification of hardened operating systems
– verification of audit log solution
The testing strategy should also include unit and usability testing to ensure suitability of design.
Before conducting a system test, a testing plan should be prepared. The testing plan should include testingdata with testing-scenarios for its evidence. The testing plan should also include an appropriate testing term.
The testing-data should be carefully prepared to be able to examine the functionality of the technical security
controls.

ITU-T X.805 framework and ISO/IEC 27001:2005 control mapping

ITU-T X.805 can also be used for technical augmentation of controls in the ISO/IEC 27001:2005 standard. In
particular, as depicted in Figure C.1, ITU-T X.805 can augment four controls in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 security
policy, asset management, access control, and information security incident management. The specific ITU-T
X.805 layer, planes, dimensions applicable to each of these controls is depicted in the Figure. For example,
for asset management, the infrastructure and service layers, and the control, and management planes are the
most applicable, with the access control and availability dimensions being the most prominent concerns.

Figure C.1 — ITU-T X.805 Augmentation for ISO/IEC 27001 Controls
As an example, the augmentation can be used to systematically assess and design the security for an
enterprise data center that stores its employee information, specifically personal information that should be
restricted to authorized users only. The employee information is accessed by several support organizations
employed by the enterprise, one of which is the help desk; in addition, the data center and systems contained
therein are maintained by the corporate IT organization. As seen in Figure C.2, the Help Desk accesses the
employee information for handling complaints, supporting orders for new IT services, resolving problems
employees are having with IT services (e.g., remote access), etc. In addition, the Corporate IT organization
accesses the employee information as part of its maintenance activities of file system maintenance, system
updates, patch management etc.

Figure C.2 — Access Scenario for Enterprise Asset
An ITU-T X.805 threat/vulnerability analysis reveals that members of the corporate IT organization can view
and modify the employee information thereby making it vulnerable to disclosure and corruption in the
infrastructure layer (see Figure C.3). In addition, as part of performing problem resolution, employee
information is transmitted in the clear between the data center and the help desk; thereby making it vulnerable
to disclosure, corruption and interception in the services layer. Thus, controls must be identified and selected
to protect employee information against threats and vulnerabilities in the management plane of its
infrastructure and services layers. It should be noted that a step-by-step ITU-T X.805 analysis is not presented
in this paper. Only the result of such an analysis is assumed for brevity.

Figure C.4 — ISO/IEC 27001 Controls
The ITU-T X.805 dimensions provide implementation and operation details for Control A.10.9.2 in the services
and infrastructure layers for the employee information asset. In the services layer, Communications Security
dimension provides for the use of VPNs to prevent misrouting. The Data Integrity dimension provides for the
use of IPSec AH to prevent incomplete transmission, unauthorized message alteration and duplication as well
as prevent message replay. The Data Confidentiality dimension provides for the use of IPSec ESP to prevent
unauthorized disclosure. In the infrastructure layer, the Data Integrity dimension provides for the use of file
checksums to prevent unauthorized alteration, the Data Confidentiality dimension provides for file encryption
to prevent unauthorized disclosure, and the Access Control dimension provides for the use of file system
access control lists (ACLs) to prevent unauthorized duplication. Figure C.5 depicts how the ITU-T X.805
dimensions provide for the implementation and operation of control A.10.9.2 to protect the employee
information asset.

ISO/IEC 27033-3:2010(E)

Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27033-3 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.
ISO/IEC 27033 consists of the following parts, under the general title Information technology — Security
techniques — Network security:
⎯ Part 1: Overview and concepts
⎯ Part 2: Guidelines for the design and implementation of network security
⎯ Part 3: Reference network scenarios — Threats, design techniques and control issues
The following parts are under preparation:
⎯ Part 4: Securing communications between networks using security gateways — Threats, design
techniques and control issues
⎯ Part 5: Securing virtual private networks — Threats, design techniques and control issues
There may be future parts to cover topics such as local area networks, wide area networks, wireless and radio
networks, broadband networks, voice networks, Internet Protocol (IP) convergence (data, voice, video)
networks, web host architectures, Internet email architectures (including outgoing online access to the Internet,
and incoming access from the Internet), and routed access to third party organizations.

Structure

The structure of this part of ISO/IEC 27033 comprises:
•

an overview of the approach to addressing security for each reference scenario listed in this part of
ISO/IEC 27033 (clause 6);

•

a clause for each reference scenario (clause 7-15), which describes
o

threats for the reference scenario,

o

a presentation of the security controls and techniques based on the approach in clause 6.

The scenarios in the document are ordered per the following framework where the objective is to evaluate a
given scenario as a function of the:
•

type of user access, whether the user is inside an enterprise, or the user is an employee who is
accessing enterprise resources from outside, or the user is a consumer, vendor or business partner, and,

•

type of information resources accessed, open, restricted or outsourced resources.

Thus, the framework helps present a consistent structure, and makes addition of new scenarios manageable,
as well as justifies the need for the various scenarios presented in this part of ISO/IEC 27033.

Overview

The guidance presented in this part of ISO/IEC 27033 for each of the identified reference network scenarios is
based on the following approach.
•

Review the background information and scope of the scenario.

•

Describe the threats relevant to the scenario.

•

Perform risk analysis on discovered vulnerabilities.

•

Analyse the business impact of addressing the vulnerabilities.

•

Determine the implementation recommendations for securing the network.

In order to address the security of any network, an approach that is systematic and provides an end-to-end
evaluation is desirable. The complexity of such an analysis is a function of the nature and size of the network
in scope. However, a consistent methodology is important to managing security, especially due to the evolving
nature of technology.
The first consideration in a security assessment is the determination of assets that require protection. These
can be largely categorized into infrastructure, services or application assets. However, an enterprise can
chose to define their own categories, but the distinction is important because the exposure to threats and
attacks is unique to each asset category or type. For instance, if a router is categorized an infrastructure asset,
and Voice over IP as an end-user service, then a Denial of Service (DoS) attack requires a different
consideration in each case . Specifically, the router requires protection against a flood of bogus packets on the
router's physical port that can prevent or impede the transmission of legitimate traffic. Similarly, the VoIP
service requires protection of the subscriber’s account/service information from deletion or corruption such
that a legitimate user is not prevented from accessing the service.
Network security also entails protection of the various activities supported on the network, such as
management activities; control/signaling messages; and end-user data (resident and in-transit). For example,
a management GUI can be subject to disclosure as a result of unauthorized access (easy to guess
administrator ID and password). The management traffic itself is subject to corruption due to forged OA&M
commands with spoofed IP addresses of the operations systems, or disclosure by sniffing, or interruption due
to a packet flood attack.
The approach of identifying assets and activities enables a modular and systematic consideration of threats.
Each reference network scenario is examined against a known set of threats to ascertain which threats are
applicable. Annex B provides a list of known industry threats. Although the list should not be viewed as
exhaustive, it provides a starting point for any analysis. Once the threat profile for the network is derived, the
vulnerabilities are analyzed to determine how the threats may be realized in the context of the specific asset
under consideration. Such an analysis will help determine what mitigations are missing and what
countermeasures need to be deployed to achieve the protection objectives. A countermeasure will reduce the

likelihood of the threat being successful and/or reduces its impact. Risk analysis that analyzes the risk represented
by discovered vulnerabilities. Business impact analysis consists of arriving at a business decision regarding how
to address each vulnerability: remediate, accept risk, or transfer risk.
Designing countermeasures and implementing controls for protecting vulnerabilities against threats is part of
any security assessment methodology. In accordance with the ISO/IEC 27000 series standard, the selection
and implementation of relevant controls is critical to asset/information protection. The standard requires the
preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, and specifically states that in addition,
other properties such as authenticity, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved.
The following is a set of security properties that is used in this part of ISO/IEC 27033 to develop mitigations
and countermeasures in an objective manner. The rationalization for the need for each security property (in
addition to confidentiality, integrity and availability) is described below.
•

Confidentiality is concerned with protecting data from unauthorized disclosure.

•

Integrity is concerned with maintaining the correctness or accuracy of data and protecting against
unauthorized modification, deletion, creation, and replication.

•

Availability is concerned with ensuring that there is no denial of authorized access to network elements,
stored information, information flows, services, and applications.

•

Access Control provides, through the use of authentication and authorization, control to enforce access to
network devices and services, and ensures that only authorized personnel or devices are allowed access
to network elements, stored information, information flows, services and applications. For example, in an
IPTV deployment, one of the known security recommendations, disabling the debugging interface on
subscriber set top boxes, is derived from a consideration of the access control property. A review of
confidentiality, integrity or availability will not result in some other recommendations.

•

Authentication is concerned with confirming or substantiating the claimed identity of a user or
communicating parties when used by access control for authorization, and provides assurance that an
entity is not attempting a masquerade or unauthorized replay of a previous communication. For instance,
an individual may gain access to a network management system, but will need to be authenticated in
order to update subscriber service records. Thus the ability to perform network management activities
cannot be assured by simply addressing confidentiality, integrity, availability, or access control.

NOTE
In Role-Based Access Control, authorization takes place by virtue of the user being assigned to a role.
Access control then verifies the user has the role prior to granting access. Similarly, access control lists grant access to
anything that satisfies the policy, so if you satisfy the policy requirements you are authorized access. The authentication
and authorization functions are null in this case.

•

Communication or Transport Security is concerned with ensuring that information only flows between
authorized end-points without being diverted or intercepted.

•

Non-repudiation in concerned with maintaining an audit trail, so that the origin of data or the cause of an
event or action cannot be denied. Identifying the authorized person that performed an unauthorized action
on protected data has nothing to do with the data's confidentiality, integrity, availability.

•

Opacity is concerned with protecting information that might be derived from the observation of network
activities. Opacity recognizes the need to protect actions in addition to information. Protecting information
is addressed by confidentiality. Protecting the conversation in a phone call between Person A and
Person B protects their confidentiality. Protecting the fact that Person A and Person B had a phone call
ensures opacity.

In all the scenarios described in this part of ISO/IEC 27033, the above-stated security properties are reviewed
as part of the security design technique and control phase. Table 2 below shows examples of network security
mechanisms that can be implemented for security properties that are selected for mitigating the potential risk.

discussed in the context of each reference network scenarios. Typically, an organization will select the
relevant ISO/IEC 27002 controls to meet their business objectives, and the guidelines in this part of
ISO/IEC 27033 are intended to provide the network level considerations required for the implementation of the
chosen controls.

7.1

Internet access services for employees
Background

Organizations that need to provide Internet access services for their employees should consider this scenario
so as to ensure access for clearly identified and authorized purposes, not general open access. Organizations
need to be concerned about managing that access to avoid loss of network bandwidth and responsiveness as
well as exposure to legal liability when employees have uncontrolled access to Internet services.
Controlling employee access to the Internet is a growing concern given the number of emerging Internet case
laws. Thus an organization is responsible for establishing, monitoring and enforcing an unambiguous Internet
Use Policy by evaluating the following scenarios, and providing relevant claims in the policy:
•

Internet access is allowed for business reasons;

•

if Internet access is also allowed in (limited) form for private purposes, which services are allowed to be
used;

•

if enhanced collaboration services are allowed;

•

if employees are allowed to participate in chat channels, forums etc.

ISO/IEC 27033-3:2010(E)

Even though often a written policy acts as a significant deterrent to unacceptable Internet usage, the
organization is still subject to substantial information security risks. In the clauses below, the security threats
and advice on security design techniques and controls to mitigate those risks are described for internal, and
internal plus external, usage.

7.2

Security threats

Security threats related to Internet access services for employees are:
•

•

Virus attacks and introduction of malware:
o

employees using the Internet are also a prime target for malware which may lead to, loss or corruption
of information and loss of control of IT infrastructure, and a huge risk to an organization's network
security;

o

user downloaded files or programs may contain malicious code. Given the ubiquity of applications
such as instant messaging, peer-to-peer file sharing, and IP telephony, employees can inadvertently
download and install a malicious application that can evade network defences using such techniques
as port agility (jumping around among open ports) and encryption. In addition, peer-to-peer
applications can be exploited to serve as covert channels for botnets;

o

vulnerabilities in web browsers or other web applications may be exploited by malware, and result in
virus infections and installation of trojans. Once infected, availability can be severely impacted due to
virus propagation activities leading to network overload. Trojans can enable unauthorized external
access leading to confidentiality violations.

Information leakage:
o

•

Unauthorized usage and access:
o

•

•

loss of control of infrastructure, systems and applications can result in fraud, denial of service, and
abuse of facilities.

Liability due to regulatory non-compliance:
o

legal liability due to non-compliance with legislation or regulatory obligations;

o

non-conformance with an organization's use policy can lead to regulatory non-compliance.

Reducing network availability due to inadequate bandwidth or stability problems:
o

7.3

applications that allow upload of information to web-based servers, may lead to uncontrolled transfer
of data from inside an organization to the Internet. If encrypted sessions are used (e.g. TLS) then
even logging of such activity may not be possible. Similar security risks are introduced when
unauthenticated portable code is executed on systems inside an organization.

excessive use of high bandwidth services such as streaming media or peer to peer file sharing may
lead to network overload.

Security design techniques and controls

Security design techniques and controls related to employee internet access services are discussed in
Table 3.
For a given security risk, each security property is reviewed for applicability in reducing the risk, and then a
corresponding technical implementation example is presented in the second column. For example, integrity,
access control, and authentication are applicable for protecting against malicious code.

Proper vulnerability management and patching of known system
vulnerabilities within timeframes based on vulnerability criticality.
Focus of vulnerability management should be all systems receiving
internet traffic, either on transport or application level, which includes all
systems used in the context of the gateways used towards the Internet
as well as end user systems used for accessing internet services,
especially if they use a windows operating system.
Throttle bandwidth for streaming media (only if permitted per business
policy).
Network and system resources should be monitored (IDS, logs, audits,
etc.) to detect system, security, and operational events.

Business to business services

8.1

Background

Organizations that conduct transactions with other organizations, such as manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer,
should consider this scenario
Traditionally business to business services have been implemented by using dedicated leased lines or
network segments. The Internet and the related technologies do provide more options, but also introduce new
security risks associated with the implementation of such services. The evolved business-to-business
e-commerce model allows organizations to conduct business over the Internet, and the applications focus on
using the Internet, extranet, or both to improve business partnerships in which the entities are known to each
other and all users are registered, unlike the business to consumer scenario.
Typically business to business services have their own requirements. For example, availability and reliability
are very important requirements as frequently organizations are directly dependent on working business to
business services.
When using the Internet as a base network connection to implement business to business services,
requirements such as availability and reliability need to be handled differently than before. Proven measures
such as quality of service assumptions used, e.g. in conjunction with leased lines, do not work any more. The
new security risks need to be mitigated by appropriate design techniques and controls. The focus is on
reinforcing trust between organizations by preventing access to unauthorized data and maintaining separation
of business systems.
In the clauses below, the security threats and advice on security design techniques and controls to mitigate
the associated risks are described for internal, and internal plus external, usage.

Business to customer services

9.1

Background

Organizations that conduct transactions with consumers should consider this scenario.
Business to customer services, also referred to as e-business services includes services such as e-commerce,
e-banking, and e-government. In business to customer services, security must balance enabling transactions
with preserving brand and business value.
The information security requirements include those associated with:
•

confidentiality (especially regarding e-banking),

•

authentication,

•

integrity,

•

data communications security where the end user expects the business service provide to protect the
transaction path between the user and the provider. Resistance against sophisticated attacks (e.g. ‘man in
the middle’ or ‘man in the browser’ attacks),

•

Availability is an important dimension for the e-business provider.

The information security characteristics include:
•

security only ‘guaranteed’ on the end platform typically under the control of an organization, providing a
good environment for implementing controls and maintaining a good platform level security,

•

security on the customer platform, often a PC, can typically be poor. It is harder to get controls
implemented in such an environment, and thus customer platforms would present significant risks in this
scenario (without a ‘conditions for secure connection’ set of requirements in a contract, which may be
difficult to impose in such an environment).

In the clauses below, the security threats and advice on security design techniques and controls to mitigate
the associated risks are described for internal, and internal plus external, usage.

9.2

Security threats

Security threats related to business to customer services are:
•

•

Virus attacks and introduction of malware:
o

malware exploits leading to infiltration of systems leading to disruptions or unauthorized access to
sensitive information;

o

vulnerabilities in web browsers or other web applications may be exploited by malware, and result in
virus infections and installation of trojans.

Unauthorized access:
o

unauthorized access of back-end databases (e.g. SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting attacks);

o

account harvesting which is the ability to derive valid account information depending on how a web
application responds to user's authentication attempts. Automated scripts are often used to harvest
valid user ids and account names.

o

online identity theft using successful social engineering attacks (through the use of deceptive
techniques), such as phishing attacks and DNS-based attacks that connect users to fraudulent webservers that look legitimate but are not;

o

unauthorized access to systems or networks with malicious intent to copy, modify or destroy data;

o

illegal content decryption leading to copyright violations and theft of content.

10 Enhanced collaboration services
10.1 Background
Organizations that utilize services involving multiple employees should consider this scenario. Examples of
such services are:
•

Groupware

•

File servers

•

Mailing List

•

Web-based services

Enhanced collaboration services, which integrate various communication and document sharing possibilities,
are an important aspect for business environments.
Such collaboration services typically integrate video telephony, voice communication with chat channels,
e-mail systems, as well as document sharing and online co-working environments.
There are two basic ways how to use such services for an organization:
•

use them as internal services only, but with the disadvantage that the services cannot be used with
external partners, etc.;

•

use them as internal services and services external to an organization. This offers much more benefit from
using such services, but at the same time has more associated security risks compared with only internal
usage.

Regarding implementation, the services may be:
•

implemented in-house, or

•

from a third party.

If the services are to be used internally and externally, then buying in collaboration services from a third party
may be a more appropriate solution.
In the clauses below, the security threats and advice on security design techniques and controls to mitigate
the associated risks are described for internal, and internal plus external, usage. The security controls apply to
management, signalling and user traffic.

11 Network segmentation
11.1 Background
Organizations that wish to divide their internal network into multiple domains in to align with the organizational
structure should consider this scenario.
Segmenting networks is a technique that can be used to augment system and application access controls.
Network segmentation can be used to group certain types of activity, application, or systems in a way that
access is only possible to those with access to the network segment. In this way, network access controls
augment other end-point access controls and provides an additional level of defence in depth. For example,
network segmentation can be used to:
•

segregate administrative and maintenance capabilities from routine user access to business applications;

•

segregate critical applications from other applications;

•

segregate databases from most users.

For multi-national organizations country specific legislation has a great influence on information security
requirements. To cover the different information security requirements for the countries an international
organization is doing business in, segmentation of a network in effect in line with country borders can be an
effective approach. For example, a particular country's legislation may require specific protection of
customer/client data, and does not allow the transfer of such data to another country. This typically requires
additional information security controls to guarantee compliance with such legislation.
In the clauses below, the security threats and advice on security design techniques and controls to mitigate
the associated risks are described for internal, and internal plus external, usage.

11.2 Security threats
Security threats related to network segmentation for fulfilling country-specific compliance requirements in
international organizations are:
•

Liability due to Regulatory Non-compliance;

•

Data Leakage:
o

breach of confidentiality, e.g. when customer/client data is accessible from countries from which it
should not,

o

breach of country specific privacy requirements,

o

reputation related risks implicated by not meeting customer/client expectations regarding
confidentiality or opacity.

12 Networking support for home and small business offices
12.1 Background
Organizations that need to provide access to internal resources to their employees at home or small offices
should consider this scenario.
Home and small business offices often require the extension of the internal network of an organization to a
home or small business location. The costs of extensions to home or small business locations is a critical
issue, since cost/benefit reflections typically do not require high implementation costs. This means cost
limitations on the security controls to be used to secure such network extensions and typically prevents the
use of established inter-networking security controls used to connect bigger Intranet segments.
In many home or small business scenarios the infrastructure may also be used for private as well as for
business purposes – which may result in additional information security risks.
In the clauses below, the security threats and advice on security design techniques and controls to mitigate
the associated risks are described for internal, and internal plus external, usage.

12.2 Security threats
Security threats related to networking support for home and small business offices are:
•

•

Unauthorized access:
o

weak configuration settings in network access equipment, e.g. of SOHO routers (Small Office and
Home Office),

o

use of split-tunneling,

o

missing or weak physical security controls,

o

longer window of opportunity due to “always-on” nature of network connectivity,

o

use of guest accounts and default settings.

Virus attacks and introduction of malware:
o

equipment, including PCs used in the home or small office network and operated with inadequate
security controls, e.g. missing or weak malware protection etc.,

•

o

problems introduced by mixing private and business environments, e.g. by the private usage of
protocols with inherent high risks, such as peer to peer file sharing protocols,

o

patching failure,

o

once infected, availability can be severely impacted due to virus propagation activities leading to
network overload.

Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information:
o

lack of encryption of data stored on systems and transmitted in the home or small business
network,

o

misuse of access possibilities such as WLAN access in the home or small business network,

o

lack of awareness and security best practices training of end-users,

o

invalidation of assumptions regarding the protection of Intranets, since the network gateways in
home or small office environments do not provide the same protection level as gateways used to
interconnect office branches.

13 Mobile communication
13.1 Background
Organizations that permit the use of mobile devices for employees should consider this scenario.
This scenario focuses on the security concerns of enterprises using and deploying mobile devices and
applications. Although the main driver for the fast development of new features of mobile devices, such as
smart phones or personal data assistants (PDAs), comes from the consumer market, these are also used in
business environments. Often such devices are personally owned and used in both for business purposes and
privately. Sometimes the devices may be company provided and are used for personal use. Thus, devices
directed at the business market need to have features introduced for the consumer market, as the vendors
want to gain as much business as possible in a competitive market.
The mobile communication devices allow remote users to synchronize personal databases, and provide
access to network services such as wireless e-mail, Web browsing, and Internet access. When a person uses
the same device for private as well as business purposes, there is a tendency to circumvent or disregard use
policies, thus introducing significant information security risks to the enterprise.
In the clauses below, the security threats and advice on security design techniques and controls to mitigate
the associated risks are described for internal, and internal plus external, usage.

13.2 Security threats
Security threats related to mobile communication devices are:
•

•

•

•

•

Unauthorized access of information stored on mobile devices due to:
o

inadequate access control or protection of sensitive information,

o

lack of awareness and inadequate passwords,

o

weak configuration,

o

hijacking attacks by rogue devices,

o

missing end user awareness of information security protection requirements, e.g. with mixing of
private and business information.

Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data and location information:
o

location-based services can disclose user position information to unauthorized third parties, thus
leading to privacy concerns,

o

eavesdropping,

o

involvement of inadequately protected third parties in the communications flow,

o

usage of plaintext or inadequately protected transmission protocols,

o

improper disposal procedures.

Unauthorized modification/deletion of stored information (including software) due to:
o

introduction of malware by installation of software from unauthorized sources,

o

exploitation of vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system.

Spam leading to:
o

increased service charges,

o

14 Networking support for travelling users
14.1 Background
Organizations that permit travelling employee to access the enterprise resources should consider this
scenario.
Solutions and offerings in this area often focus on the functionality side and are targeted primarily to the
consumer market. From an information security viewpoint, the offered functionality levels introduce new risks,
e.g. by affecting or invalidating assumptions regarding information security. For example, an assumption of
maintaining a well controlled and (from the outside) protected Intranet may be questioned substantially if
travelling user access to the Intranet is not implemented with appropriate controls.
In the clauses below, the security threats and advice on security design techniques and controls to mitigate
the associated risks are described for internal, and internal plus external, usage.

14.2 Security threats
Security threats related to networking support for travelling users are:
•

•

Unauthorized access:
o

misuse of travelling user network support to gain unauthorized access to the Intranet of an
organization,

o

compromise of security gateways used on the Intranet network border,

o

unauthorized access to data stored on travelling user devices.

15 Outsourced services
15.1 Background
Organizations that use outsourced services should consider this scenario.
Organizations use outsourced services because it is viewed as a viable business strategy, but it also
introduces organizational and operational complexities, specifically for ensuring the quality and security of
outsourced services.
The extended enterprise inherits additional risk because of the dependency on the service provider. For
instance, service providers or vendors can require direct access to assets inside an enterprise for support
and/or incident management issues, thus exposing critical assets to security risks. Whilst many support
services require permanent access rights to the supported infrastructure, others may only need temporary
access. Often support services need highly privileged access rights in order to fulfil their tasks.
Regardless of the type of outsourcing scenario, security considerations and oversight is required in all such
contractual arrangements. A general view of threat and concerns is presented is this document. More in-depth
information about securing outsourced services can be found in ISO/IEC 27036.
In the clauses below, the security threats and advice on security design techniques and controls to mitigate
the associated risks are described for internal, and internal plus external, usage.

15.2 Security threats
Security threats related to outsourced services are:
•

•

•

•

Unauthorized access to other internal systems (when supplier accesses internal systems for remote
support and maintenance):
o

abuse of remote maintenance ports,

o

abuse of administrator rights.

Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data by service provider:
o

lack of respect for intellectual property rights,

o

lack of separation of multi-customer environments,

o

lack of information security best practices (for example, password sharing may be rampant),

o

mishandling of storage media,

o

use of non-secure communications methods.

Annex A
(informative)
An Example Internet Use Policy

A.1 Overview
InfoSec's intentions for publishing an Acceptable Use Policy are not to impose restrictions that are contrary to
<Company Name>'s established culture of openness, trust and integrity. InfoSec is committed to protecting
<Company Name>'s employees, partners and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals,
either knowingly or unknowingly.
Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems, including but not limited to computer equipment, software,
operating systems, storage media, network accounts providing electronic mail, WWW browsing, and FTP, are
the property of <Company Name>. These systems are to be used for business purposes in serving the
interests of the company, and of our clients and customers in the course of normal operations. Please review
Human Resources policies for further details.
Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of every <Company Name> employee
and affiliate who deals with information and/or information systems. It is the responsibility of every computer
user to know these guidelines, and to conduct their activities accordingly.

A.2 Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of computer equipment at <Company Name>.
These rules are in place to protect the employee and <Company Name>. Inappropriate use exposes
<Company Name> to risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services, and legal
issues.

A.3 Scope
This policy applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporaries, and other workers at <Company
Name>, including all personnel affiliated with third parties. This policy applies to all equipment that is owned or
leased by <Company Name>.

A.4 Policy
A.4.1 General Use and Ownership
1. While <Company Name>'s network administration desires to provide a reasonable level of opacity,
users should be aware that the data they create on the corporate systems remains the property of
<Company Name>. Because of the need to protect <Company Name>'s network, management
cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information stored on any network device belonging to
<Company Name>.
2. Employees are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding the reasonableness of personal
use. Individual departments are responsible for creating guidelines concerning personal use of
Internet/Intranet/Extranet systems. In the absence of such policies, employees should be guided by
departmental policies on personal use, and if there is any uncertainty, employees should consult their
supervisor or manager.

3. InfoSec recommends that any information that users consider sensitive or vulnerable be encrypted.
For guidelines on information classification, see InfoSec's Information Sensitivity Policy. For
guidelines on encrypting email and documents, go to InfoSec's Awareness Initiative.
4. For security and network maintenance purposes, authorized individuals within <Company Name>
may monitor equipment, systems and network traffic at any time, per InfoSec's Audit Policy.
5. <Company Name> reserves the right to audit networks and systems on a periodic basis to ensure
compliance with this policy.

A.4.2 Security and Proprietary Information
1. The user interface for information contained on Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems should be
classified as either confidential or not confidential, as defined by corporate confidentiality guidelines,
details of which can be found in Human Resources policies. Examples of confidential information
include but are not limited to: company private, corporate strategies, competitor sensitive, trade
secrets, specifications, customer lists, and research data. Employees should take all necessary steps
to prevent unauthorized access to this information.
2. Keep passwords secure and do not share accounts. Authorized users are responsible for the security
of their passwords and accounts. System level passwords should be changed quarterly, user level
passwords should be changed every six months.
3. All PCs, laptops and workstations should be secured with a password-protected screensaver with the
automatic activation feature set at 10 minutes or less, or by logging-off (control-alt-delete for Win2K
users) when the host will be unattended.
4. Use encryption of information in compliance with InfoSec's Acceptable Encryption Use policy.
5. Because information contained on portable computers is especially vulnerable, special care should be
exercised. Protect laptops in accordance with the “Laptop Security Tips”.
6. Postings by employees from a <Company Name> email address to newsgroups should contain a
disclaimer stating that the opinions expressed are strictly their own and not necessarily those of
<Company Name>, unless posting is in the course of business duties.
7. All hosts used by the employee that are connected to the <Company Name>
Internet/Intranet/Extranet, whether owned by the employee or <Company Name>, shall be continually
executing approved virus-scanning software with a current virus database unless overridden by
departmental or group policy.
8. Employees should use extreme caution when opening e-mail attachments received from unknown
senders, which may contain viruses, e-mail bombs, or Trojan horse code.

A.4.3 Unacceptable Use
The following activities are, in general, prohibited. Employees may be exempted from these restrictions during
the course of their legitimate job responsibilities (e.g., systems administration staff may have a need to disable
the network access of a host if that host is disrupting production services).
Under no circumstances is an employee of <Company Name> authorized to engage in any activity that is
illegal under local, state, federal or international law while utilizing <Company Name>-owned resources.
The lists below are by no means exhaustive, but attempt to provide a framework for activities which fall into
the category of unacceptable use.

Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO/IEC 27034-1 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology,
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques.
ISO/IEC 27034 consists of the following parts, under the general title Information technology — Security
techniques ― Application security:
― Part 1: Overview and concepts
The following parts are under preparation:
― Part 2: Organization normative framework
― Part 3: Application security management process
― Part 4: Application security validation
― Part 5: Protocols and application security control data structure

Introduction
0.1

General

Organizations should protect their information and technological infrastructures in order to stay in business.
Traditionally this has been addressed at the IT level by protecting the perimeter and such technological
infrastructure components as computers and networks, which is generally insufficient.
In addition, organizations are increasingly protecting themselves at the governance level by operating
formalized, tested and verified information security management systems (ISMS). A systematic approach
contributes to an effective information security management system as described in ISO/IEC 27001.
However, organizations face an ever-growing need to protect their information at the application level.
Applications should be protected against vulnerabilities which might be inherent to the application itself (e.g.
software defects), appear in the course of the application's life cycle (e.g. through changes to the application),
or arise due to the use of the application in a context for which it was not intended.
A systematic approach to increased application security provides evidence that information being used or
stored by an organization’s applications is adequately protected.
Applications can be acquired through internal development, outsourcing or purchasing a commercial product.
Applications can also be acquired through a combination of these approaches which might introduce new
security implications that should be considered and managed.
Examples of applications are human resource systems, finance systems, word-processing systems, customer
management systems, firewalls, anti-virus systems and intrusion detection systems.
Throughout its life cycle, a secure application exhibits prerequisite characteristics of software quality, such as
predictable execution and conformance, as well as meeting security requirements from a development,
management, technological infrastructure, and audit perspective. Security-enhanced processes and
practices—and the skilled people to perform them—are required to build trusted applications that do not
increase risk exposure beyond an acceptable or tolerable level of residual risk and support an effective ISMS.
Additionally, a secure application takes into account the security requirements stemming from the type of data,
the targeted environment (business, regulatory and technological contexts), the actors and the application
specifications. It should be possible to obtain evidence that is shown to demonstrate that an acceptable (or
tolerable) level of residual risk has been attained and is being maintained.

0.2

Purpose

The purpose of ISO/IEC 27034 is to assist organizations in integrating security seamlessly throughout the life
cycle of their applications by:
a) providing concepts, principles, frameworks, components and processes;
b) providing process-oriented mechanisms for establishing security requirements, assessing security
risks, assigning a Targeted Level of Trust and selecting corresponding security controls and
verification measures;
c) providing guidelines for establishing acceptance criteria to organizations outsourcing the development
or operation of applications, and for organizations purchasing from third-party applications;
d) providing process-oriented mechanisms for determining, generating and collecting the evidence
needed to demonstrate that their applications can be used securely under a defined environment;
e) supporting the general concepts specified in ISO/IEC 27001 and assisting with the satisfactory
implementation of information security based on a risk management approach; and
f) providing a framework that helps to implement the security controls specified in ISO/IEC 27002 and
other standards.

ISO/IEC 27034-1:2011(E)

ISO/IEC 27034:
a) applies to the underlying software of an application and to contributing factors that impact its security,
such as data, technology, application development life cycle processes, supporting processes and
actors; and
b) applies to all sizes and all types of organizations (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies,
non-profit organizations) exposed to risks associated with applications.
ISO/IEC 27034 does not:
a) provide guidelines for physical and network security;
b) provide controls or measurements; or
c) provide secure coding specifications for any programming language.
ISO/IEC 27034 is not:
a) a software application development standard;
b) an application project management standard; or
c) a software development life cycle standard.
The requirements and processes specified in ISO/IEC 27034 are not intended to be implemented in isolation
but rather integrated into an organization's existing processes. To this effect, organizations should map their
existing processes and frameworks to those proposed by ISO/IEC 27034, thus reducing the impact of
implementing ISO/IEC 27034.
Annex A (informative) provides an example illustrating how an existing software development process can be
mapped to some of the components and processes of ISO/IEC 27034. Generally speaking, an organization
using any development life cycle should perform a mapping such as the one described in Annex A, and add
whatever missing components or processes are needed for compliance with ISO/IEC 27034.

0.3

Targeted audiences

0.3.1

General

The following audiences will benefit from ISO/IEC 27034 while carrying out their designated organizational
roles:

ISO/IEC 27034-1:2011(E)

Typically managers need to:
a) balance the cost of implementing and maintaining application security against the risks and value it
represents for the organization;
b) review auditor’s reports recommending acceptance or rejection based on whether an application has
attained and maintained its Targeted Level of Trust;
c) ensure compliance with standards, laws and regulations according to an application’s regulatory
context (see 8.1.2.2);
d) oversee the implementation of a secure application;
e) authorize the Targeted Level of Trust according to the organization’s specific context;
f) determine which security controls and corresponding verification measurements should be
implemented and tested;
g) minimize application security verification costs;
h) document security policies and procedures for an application;
i) provide security awareness, training and oversight to all actors;
j) put in place proper information security clearances required by applicable information security policies
and procedures; and
k) stay abreast of all system-related security plans throughout the organization's network.
0.3.3

Provisioning and operation teams

Members of provisioning and operation teams (known collectively as the project team) are persons involved in
an application’s design, development and maintenance throughout its whole life cycle. Members include:
a) architects,
b) analysts,
c) programmers,
d) testers,
e) system administrators,
f) database administrators,
g) network administrators, and
h) technical personnel.
Typically members need to:
a) understand which controls should be applied at each stage of an application's life cycle and why;
b) understand which controls should be implemented in the application itself;
c) minimize the impact of introducing controls into the development, test and documentation activities
within the application life cycle;
d) make sure that introduced controls meet the requirements of the associated measurements;
e) obtain access to tools and best practices in order to streamline development, testing and
documentation;
f) facilitate peer review;
g) participate in acquisition planning and strategy;
h) establish business relationships to obtain needed goods and services, (e.g. for the solicitation,
evaluation and awarding of contracts); and
i) arrange disposal of residual items after work is completed, (e.g. property management/disposal).

0.3.4

Acquirers

This includes all persons involved in acquiring a product or service.
Typically acquirers need to:
a) prepare requests for proposals that include requirements for security controls;
b) select suppliers that comply with such requirements;
c) verify evidence of security controls applied by outsourcing services; and
d) evaluate products by verifying evidence of correctly implemented application security controls.
0.3.5

Suppliers

This includes all persons involved in supplying a product or service.
Typically suppliers need to:
a) comply to application security requirements from requests for proposals;
b) select appropriate application security controls for proposals, with respect to their impact on cost; and
c) provide evidence that required security controls are implemented correctly in proposed products or
services.
0.3.6

Auditors

Auditors are persons who need to:
a) understand the scope and procedures involved in verification measurements for the corresponding
controls;
b) ensure that audit results are repeatable;
c) establish a list of verification measurements which generate evidence that an application has reached
the Targeted Level of Trust as required by management; and
d) apply standardized audit processes based on the use of verifiable evidence.
0.3.7

Users

Users are persons who need to:
a) trust that it is deemed secure to use or deploy an application;
b) trust that an application produces reliable results consistently and in a timely manner; and
c) trust that the controls and their corresponding verification measurements are positioned and
functioning correctly as expected.

0.4
0.4.1

Principles
Security is a requirement

Security requirements should be defined and analyzed for each and every stage of an application's life cycle,
adequately addressed and managed on a continuous basis.
Application security requirements (see 6.4) should be treated in the same manner as functionality, quality and
usability requirements (see ISO/IEC 9126 for an example of a quality model). In addition, security-related
requirements to conform to the established limitations on residual risk should be instituted.
According to ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 (under development), requirements should be necessary, abstract,
unambiguous, consistent, complete, concise, feasible, traceable and verifiable. The same characteristics
apply to security requirements. Vague security requirements such as “The developer should discover all
important security risks for the application” are too often encountered in application projects' documentation.

ISO/IEC 27034-1:2011(E)

0.4.2

Application security is context-dependent

Application security is influenced by a defined target environment. The type and scope of application security
requirements are determined by the risks to which the application is subjected, which in turn depend on three
contexts:
a) business context: specific risks arising from the organization’s business domain (phone company,
transport company, government, etc.);
b) regulatory context: specific risks arising from the geographical location where the organization is doing
business (intellectual property rights and licensing, restrictions on cryptography protection, copyright,
laws and regulations, privacy legislation, etc.);
c) technological context: specific risks from the technologies used by the organization in the course of
business [reverse engineering, security of build tools, protection of source code, use of third-party precompiled code, security testing, penetration testing, bounds checking, code checking, information and
communication technology (ICT) environment in which the application runs, configuration files and
uncompiled data, operating system privileges for installation and/or operation, maintenance, secure
distribution, etc.].
The technological context encompasses applications’ technical specifications (security functionality,
secure components, online payments, secure log, cryptography, permissions management, etc.).
An organization can affirm that an application is secure, but this affirmation is only valid for this particular
organization in its specific business, regulatory and technological contexts. If, for example, the application’s
technological infrastructure changes, or the application is used for the same purposes in another country,
these new contexts might impact the security requirements and the Targeted Level of Trust. The current
Application Security Controls might no longer adequately address the new security requirements and the
application might no longer be secure.
0.4.3

Appropriate investment for application security

The costs of applying Application Security Controls and performing audit measurements should be
commensurate with the Targeted Level of Trust (see 8.1.2.6.4) required by the application owner or by
management.
These costs can be considered as an investment because they reduce the costs, application owner
responsibilities and legal consequences of security breaches.
0.4.4

Application security should be demonstrated

The application auditing process in ISO/IEC 27034 (see 8.5) makes use of the verifiable evidence provided by
Application Security Controls (see 8.1.2.6.5).
An application cannot be declared secure unless the auditor agrees that the supporting evidence generated
by the corresponding verification measurements of the applicable Application Security Controls demonstrates
that it has reached management’s Targeted Level of Trust.

Structure of ISO/IEC 27034

ISO/IEC 27034 consists of six documents or parts. This part of ISO/IEC 27034 presents an overview and
necessary concepts. It is self-contained and sufficient for the purposes of evaluating the need for
implementation of ISO/IEC 27034 in an organization, and for presentation and training purposes. This part of
ISO/IEC 27034 by itself is not sufficient for implementing ISO/IEC 27034.
ISO/IEC 27034-2, -3 and -4 should be acquired by organizations wishing to implement ISO/IEC 27034. They
contain in-depth discussions, enumerations, structures and descriptions for all concepts presented in this part
of ISO/IEC 27034.
ISO/IEC 27034-5 will be especially useful for organizations interested in acquiring or distributing controls, by
providing a standard data structure and a standard protocol for the distribution of controls. For example, a
large organization might be interested in automated distribution and updates of controls to all of its sub-units.
ISO/IEC 27034-6 provides examples of controls for specific application security requirements and will be
useful to organizations wishing to implement ISO/IEC 27034, or by organizations wishing to develop specific
controls.
The contents of the six parts are as follows:
PART 1 – Overview and concepts
Part 1 presents an overview of application security. It introduces definitions, concepts, principles
and processes involved in application security.
PART 2 – Organization normative framework
Part 2 presents an in-depth discussion of the Organization Normative Framework, its components
and the organization-level processes for managing it. This part explains the relationships among
these processes, the activities associated with them, and the means by which they support the
Application Security Management Process. This part will discuss how an organization should
implement ISO/IEC 27034 and integrate it into its existing processes.
PART 3 – Application security management process
Part 3 presents an in-depth discussion of the processes involved in an application project:
determining the application requirements and environment, assessing the application security
risks, creating and maintaining the Application Normative Framework, realizing and operating the
application and validating its security throughout its life cycle. It explains the relationships among
these processes, their activities and interdependencies, and how they introduce security into an
application project.
PART 4 – Application security validation
Part 4 presents an in-depth discussion of the application security validation and certification
process that measures the application's Actual Level of Trust and compares it with the application's
Targeted Level of Trust previously selected by the organization.
PART 5 – Protocols and application security control data structure
Part 5 presents the protocols and XML schema for the Application Security Control (ASC) based
on the ISO/IEC TS 15000 series: Electronic business eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML). It will
be used to help organizations validate the data structure of their ASCs and other components of
ISO/IEC 27034, and to help automate the distribution, updating and use of ASCs.
PART 6 – Security guidance for specific applications
Part 6, if necessary, could provide examples of ASCs tailored for specific application security
requirements.

Introduction to application security

6.1

General

Application security is a process performed to apply controls and measurements to an organization’s
applications in order to manage the risk of using them.
Controls and measurements can be applied to the application itself (its processes, components, software and
results), to its data (configuration data, user data, organization data), and to all technology, processes and
actors involved in the application’s life cycle.

6.2

Application security vs software security

An application is an IT solution that includes software (see definition in clause 3). Application security is thus a
broader concept that encompasses software security.

6.3
6.3.1

Application security scope
General

Application security protects the critical data computed, used, stored and transferred by an application as
required by the organization. This protection ensures not only the data’s availability, integrity and
confidentiality, but also the authentication and non-repudiation of users who access it. The criticality of data
and other assets should be defined by the organization through its security risk assessment process.
The critical data requiring protection also includes application source code, binary code and the runtime code
on which it executes.
Figure 2 shows a graphical representation of the application security scope, represented as the area delimited
by the dotted line.

Application security requirements
Application security requirements sources

As discussed in ISO/IEC 27005, application security requirements are identified by risk assessment and risk
treatment, and are dictated by such factors as application specifications, the application's target environment
(business, regulatory and technological contexts), critical data and choices made by the application owner.

ISO/IEC 27034-1:2011(E)

Functional security requirements dictate which security functionalities will be implemented in the application.
Non-functional security requirements address security qualities that the application should exhibit. These
controls should already have been globally defined and approved by the organization.
6.4.2

Application security requirements engineering

Application requirements engineering is the broader process of gathering, analysing and specifying
requirements for an application. It should be enhanced with risk assessment to incorporate security
requirements.
As with any requirement, risk assessment should involve the use of repeatable and systematic procedures
that will ensure that the set of requirements obtained is complete, consistent, and easy to understand and
analysable by the application owner. Also, the requirements and the achievement thereof should be
measurable.
6.4.3

ISMS

6.4.3.1

Organization ISMS

All information held and processed by an organization is subject to risks of error, flood, fire, theft, etc., and to
hazards related to the technology in use. The term ‘information security’ is predicated on information as an
asset with an assigned value requiring appropriate protection. According to ISO/IEC 27000, an Information
Security Management System (ISMS) provides a model for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring,
reviewing, maintaining and improving the protection of an organization’s information assets based on a
business risk approach. The protection of organization information assets should be aligned with associated
risks and business acceptance levels.
This management of risks relies on information security and covers all forms of risk associated with all forms
of information usage by the organization.
6.4.3.2

Application security in the context of an ISMS

Application security supports organization-wide ISMS goals by providing a model for establishing,
implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving the protection of the organization’s
information assets associated with its applications. Application security should provide adequate controls and
evidence to prove to the organization’s managers that the risks involved in utilizing an application are
managed adequately.
ISMS governs application security by ensuring that all risks involving organizational information are managed,
including information accessed by applications. The controls required by the ISMS are extended down to the
application level.

6.5

Risk

6.5.1

Application security risk

Application security risk is the risk to an organization posed by use of a specific application.
Application security risk comes from:
a) threats targeting the information accessed by an application;
b) vulnerabilities; and
c) impact of successful exploitation of vulnerabilities by threats.
The activity of identifying, tracking, storing, measuring, and reporting application risks is of the utmost
importance. Application security requirements and the controls to address them are a reaction to this risk. An
application security risk assessment process is needed because risk changes over time, resulting in the need
for continuous and consistent identification and storage of risk information.

ISO/IEC 27034-1:2011(E)

6.5.2

Application vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities are the result of inadequate or nonexistent controls. Inadequately controlled vulnerabilities
result in unacceptable application risk.
Vulnerabilities come from:
a) actors, such as programmers who write poor code, users who make errors using the software and
technicians and developers who make errors while maintaining the application;
b) processes, such as inadequate testing procedures, poor project management, insufficient focus on
security throughout the life cycle processes, unanticipated interactions among applications, users and
operators, inadequate change management processes;
c) the technological context, such as bad choices of technological infrastructure or products; and
d) specifications, such as inadequate design, vulnerabilities due to system interactions or errors in
component interfaces.
6.5.3

Threats to applications

A threat has the potential to harm critical information in the application scope, and thereby the organization
itself. Threats come from:
a) the application's environment: regulatory context, business context and technological context; and
b) actors.
6.5.4

Impact on applications

An impact is the cost to an organization of suffering a breach in availability, integrity or confidentiality of its
critical application data.
6.5.5

Risk management

Application security risk management is the process of maintaining application security risks within acceptable
levels. This is achieved by treating application security risks that are judged to be unacceptable, more
specifically by applying controls to them.
Risk management is a key concept in information security. According to ISO/IEC 27005, “the information
security risk management process can be applied to the organization as a whole, any discrete part of the
organization (e.g. a department, a physical location, a service), any information system, existing or planned or
particular aspects of control (e.g. business continuity planning).”
The information security risk management process presented in ISO/IEC 27005 consists of context
establishment, risk assessment, risk treatment, risk acceptance, risk communication, and risk monitoring and
review.
An application security risk management process should use the same process elements, with finer
granularity and a scope adjusted to the application level.

6.6

Security costs

The cost to an organization of implementing, maintaining and verifying security controls should be minimized
to an acceptable (or tolerable) level after proper consideration of the risks and related impacts of using an
application. The cost of security should take into account the potential impact of threats and vulnerabilities.

6.7

Target environment

The target environment is comprised of the regulatory, business and technological contexts within which the
organization will use its application. All threats that might harm an application come from its environment. For
this reason, the application's target environment should be clearly defined at the beginning of an application
project.
To successfully and securely deploy the application, the organization’s technological context should comply
with the application's target environment requirements. Once the application has been implemented, the
organization’s technological context might add new products and hardware that could impact the security of
other applications and influence the organization’s security risks.

ISO/IEC 27034-1:2011(E)

Because risks for an organization to use the application come from the application’s target environment, new
application security requirements should be defined to address these new risks and select controls that
mitigate these risks to an acceptable (or tolerable) level. These security controls can be introduced into the
application life cycle processes (such as the Acquisition Process or the Disposal Process), added to the
application’s source code or integrated elsewhere in the application life cycle (see 8.3.4) as needed by the
organization.

6.8

Controls and their objectives

As specified in ISO/IEC 27001, controls and their objectives should be selected and implemented to meet the
requirements determined by the risk assessment and risk treatment processes. In application security, the risk
assessment process determines the control objectives as defined by the application security requirements.

7.1

ISO/IEC 27034 overall processes
Components, processes and frameworks

ISO/IEC 27034 provides components, processes and frameworks to help organizations acquire, implement
and use trustworthy applications, at an acceptable (or tolerable) security cost. More specifically, these
components, processes and frameworks provide verifiable evidence that applications have reached and
maintained a Targeted Level of Trust.
All components, processes and frameworks are part of two overall processes, as shown in Figure 3:
a) the ONF Management Process, and
b) the Application Security Management Process (ASMP).
These two processes are used at different levels and time frames within the organization and have different
scopes. The ONF Management Process is a continuous organizational-level process and the ASMP is used
for managing security on specific application projects.

ONF Management Process

This process should be used for managing the application security-related aspects of the ONF
(Organization Normative Framework, see 8.1). This framework contains all processes involved in application
security, as well as regulations, laws, best practices, roles and responsibilities accepted by the organization. It
defines all organization’s contexts and becomes the unique referential for application security within the
organization.
NOTE 1 The organization normally uses its normative framework for other purposes that fall outside the scope of ISO/IEC 27034, and
normally has defined processes for managing it. Thus, the ONF and its management process, for the purposes of ISO/IEC 27034, is a
subset of the existing ONF and related processes.

Application security-related processes should be part of the ONF.
Oversight and responsibility for maintaining and approving the application security-related components of the
ONF should be assigned to an organizational role, which is referred to as the “ONF committee” in
ISO/IEC 27034.
NOTE 2 The ONF Management Process and its associated components and sub-processes are presented in more detail in
subclause 8.1.3.2, as well as in ISO/IEC 27034-2.

Application Security Management Process

7.3.1

General

The Application Security Management Process is the overall process for managing security for each
application used by an organization. Annex C demonstrates that the ASMP is a specialization of the risk
management process presented in ISO/IEC 27005.
The Application Security Management Process is performed in five steps:
a) Specifying the application requirements and environment;
b) assessing application security risks;
c) creating and maintaining the Application Normative Framework;
d) provisioning and operating the application; and
e) auditing the security of the application.
NOTE

7.3.2

The ASMP is presented in more detail in clause 8, as well as in ISO/IEC 27034-3.

Specifying the application requirements and environment

The first step of the ASMP is to specify all application requirements, including:
a) actors;
b) specifications;
c) information; and
d) environment.
The application's environment consists of
a) a technological context,
b) a business context, and
c) a regulatory context.
NOTE

Contexts are presented in more detail in clauses 8.1.2.1 to 8.1.2.2.

This step corresponds to the “context establishment” step in the risk management process established by
ISO/IEC 27005. It provides necessary information for the subsequent risk assessment step.
7.3.3

Assessing application security risks

The second step of the ASMP is a process corresponding to the “risk assessment” step and a part of the “risk
treatment” step in the risk management process established by ISO/IEC 27005, with a finer granularity level
and a scope limited to a single application project.
Risk assessment consists of risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation.
This step of the ASMP also produces security requirements, which are used to obtain the desired level of trust
for the application. This is called the application’s Targeted Level of Trust (see 8.2.4). It should be approved
by the application owner.
For this reason, this step also corresponds to the “Selection of risk treatment options” part of the “risk
treatment” step in the risk management process established by ISO/IEC 27005.
7.3.4

Creating and maintaining the Application Normative Framework

The third step of the ASMP selects all the relevant elements from the ONF that apply to a specific application
project. This results in the Application Normative Framework (ANF). The application's Targeted Level of Trust,
the application contexts (regulatory, business and technological), the actors’ responsibilities and professional

It is also during this step that the organization derives the life cycle for the application project, which contains
only those activities needed for the application project. For example, a project developed entirely in-house
does not require outsourcing activities.
In addition, the organization selects the applicable Application Security Controls for the application project.
This step corresponds to the “Preparing and implementing risk treatment plans” part of the “risk treatment”
step in the risk management process established by ISO/IEC 27005.
NOTE

7.3.5

This step of the ASMP and its associated components and processes is presented in more detail in 8.3.

Provisioning and operating the application

The fourth step of the ASMP is the actual use of the Application Security Controls, as provided by the ANF in
the application's life cycle. The project team implements the Application Security Controls under the ANF, in
two sub-steps:
a) the security activity part of each ASC is performed by the corresponding actor assigned in the ASC;
and
b) the security measurement part of each ASC is performed by the corresponding actor assigned in the
ASC.
This fourth step corresponds to the “Preparing and implementing risk treatment plans” part of the “risk
treatment” step in the risk management process established by ISO/IEC 27005.
NOTE

7.3.6

This step of the ASMP and its associated components and processes is presented in more detail in 8.4.

Auditing the security of the application

The fifth and final step of the ASMP is the security audit of the application.
In this step, a verification team verifies that all the verification measurements provided by all the ASCs in the
Application Normative Framework have been performed and that the expected results were attained.
This step corresponds to the “Monitoring and review” step in the risk management process established by
ISO/IEC 27005.

Concepts

8.1.1

Organization Normative Framework
General

The Organization Normative Framework (ONF) is a framework where all application security best practices
recognized by the organization are stored, or from which they will be refined or derived. It comprises essential
components, processes that utilize these components, and processes for managing the ONF itself.
The ONF is the foundation of application security in the organization and all the organization's application
security decisions are based on it. For example, an activity of code review can only be performed as a
mandatory Application Security Control if coding guidelines exist in the ONF.
As shown in Figure 3, the ONF is the main input for the ASMP which is performed for each application project
in the organization.
Figure 4 shows a high-level view of the ONF contents.

Application Life Cycle Security Reference Model

Figure 4 – Organization Normative Framework (simplified)
For the purposes of correctly addressing application security concerns, an organization should have a formal
ONF containing the following components:
a) business context;
b) regulatory context;
c) technological context;
d) application specifications repository;
e) roles, responsibilities and qualifications;
f)

organization ASC Library;

Also, the formal ONF should contain the following processes:
a) ONF Management Process; and
b) ONF management subprocesses.
8.1.2
8.1.2.1

Components
Business context

The business context lists and documents all standards and best practices adopted by the organization that
could impact application projects.
The business context includes:
a) project management, development, risk analysis, operational, audit and control processes;
b) the organization’s security policy;
c) practices for the business domain;
d) the development methodology used by the organization;
e) best practices for all programming languages employed by the organization and listed in the
technological context;

the organization’s formal project management process; and

g) the adoption of other relevant ISO/IEC International Standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001,
ISO/IEC 27002, and ISO/IEC 15288.
8.1.2.2

Regulatory context

The regulatory context lists and documents any law or regulation, in any of the organization’s business
locations, that could impact application projects. It includes laws, rules and regulations of the countries or
jurisdictions where the application is developed and/or deployed and/or used.
An organization deploying and/or using the same application in more than one country might have to meet
different security requirements for each country.
8.1.2.3

Application specifications repository

The application specifications repository lists and documents the organization’s general IT functional
requirements and corresponding pre-approved solutions. Application specifications should include:
a) specifications about how applications should compute, store and transfer information;
b) usual application parameters, functionalities, services and requirements; and
c) source code, binary code, libraries and products or services used or relied upon by applications.
Additional specifications may include those detailing how the application interacts with:
a) other systems;
b) the runtime infrastructure upon which it depends; and
c) the list of controls within the runtime environment.
8.1.2.4

Technological context

The technological context comprises the inventory of all IT products, services and technologies available to
the organization for application projects. These products, services and technologies determine the threats to
which applications are exposed.
The technological context includes computers, tools, IT products and services, communication infrastructure
and other technical devices.
EXAMPLE 1
Technological contexts that might have an impact on application security include client-server infrastructure, web
infrastructure, network infrastructure and development environment and tools.

The technological context also determines the feasibility of introducing certain Application Security Controls
into an application.
EXAMPLE 2
If the technological context does not include the TLS 1.0 authentication mechanism to support “bi-directional
authentication” functionality, a TLS 1.0 based ASC may not be included in an application. A project team would have to select an
alternative ASC in order to obtain the bi-directional authentication functionality, if that functionality is required at the application's Targeted
Level of Trust.

The technological context should include:
a) technologies available for application projects in the organization;
This inventory of technologies should be continuously updated by the organization’s ONF committee
via feedback from previous application projects.
b) technologies required by an application;
The list of new technologies comes from new functional requirements specified in the course of the
instigation planning of an application project. Such requirements should be added to the ONF and an
organizational process should ensure that security characteristics of the technologies set apart for
fulfilling the new requirements are understood and documented before being approved for inclusion in
the organization’s inventory of technologies; and
c) available technologies;
This comes from research, trend analysis, and technology monitoring.

8.1.2.5

Roles, responsibilities and qualifications

The ONF should contain:
a) lists and descriptions of all roles, responsibilities and required professional qualifications for actors
involved in creating and maintaining the ONF and/or roles for creating and maintaining ASCs; and
b) lists and descriptions all roles, responsibilities and required professional qualifications for actors
involved in the organization’s application life cycle, such as information security managers, project
managers, administrators, software acquirers, software development managers, application owners,
user managers, architects, analysts, programmers, testers, system administrators, database
administrators, network administrators and technical personnel.
This is an organization-wide policy that will help ensure that all critical roles for all processes are filled, that all
responsibilities are defined, that conflicts of interest are avoided, and that people filling the roles have
sufficient professional qualifications.
8.1.2.6
8.1.2.6.1

Organization ASC Library
General

The organization should define at least one library of controls for application security. This library is called an
Application Security Control Library (ASC Library). It lists and documents all ASCs recognized by the
organization. These ASCs evolved from standards, best practices and roles, responsibilities, and professional
qualifications, technological, business, and regulatory contexts and application specifications.
Application Security Controls within this library are organized in sets according to the level of protection they
provide against security threats. Each set receives a label called 'levels of trust' to inform managers of the
degree of security obtained from a particular defined set of controls. If a set of controls is described as having
a low level of trust, it provides limited protection of information security. If a set of controls is defined as having
a high level of trust, then it provides a high level of protection. Levels of trust are further described in 8.1.2.6.4.
Precise and detailed ASCs for each specific application project are selected from this organizational ASC
library.
8.1.2.6.2

Example of an Organization ASC Library

Figure 5 shows a simple example of an organization's existing ASC Library. The organization in this example
develops applications in the field of aeronautics. The library contains all of the controls that the organization
needs for implementing functionalities, best practices, standards, applicable laws and regulations.

Figure 5 – Graphical representation of an example of an Organization ASC Library
In this example, the organization has defined two application specifications: secure logging and on-line
payment. The business context in which this particular organization is the field of aeronautics, and it
implements the PCI-DSS industry standard. The regulatory context imposes compliance with certain privacy
laws. The technological context shows that this organization has defined controls for SSL connections and for
wireless networking.
This simple example shows that the organization’s application specifications, as well as its business,
regulatory and technological contexts determine the contents of an organization’s ASC Library. Each
organization's ASC Library will thus be specific to that particular organization.
8.1.2.6.3

Process for creating the Organization ASC Library

The process for creating the ASC Library is simple and can be easily performed by even the smallest
organizations.
The library is empty at first. ASCs are added by grouping them in columns corresponding to needed levels of
trust (see the columns in Figure 5). An organization might need more than one level of trust for its
applications.
It is the ONF committee’s responsibility to build an ASC library that satisfies the organization’s particular
needs and requirements.
This goal is best achieved by analyzing the organization’s new or existing applications. This analysis involves
determining the security risks and requirements for the application, then selecting or creating ASCs to meet
those requirements. For each application analyzed, the result is a set of ASCs.

ISO/IEC 27034-1:2011(E)

This set of ASCs can match the existing ASC library in three possible ways:
a) the entire set of ASCs already comprises an existing level of trust in the library, in which case nothing
is added to the library;
b) an existing level of trust closely matches the full set of ASCs, in which case the library can be
completed by ASCs from the set; or
c) a new level of trust is created in the library from the set of ASCs.
Thus, an organization might decide to build from its existing expertise by re-using security controls from its
existing applications, or it could create or acquire new controls, or both.
The organization’s ASC library expands in response to feedback from each new application project, as
outlined in 8.1.3.2.
8.1.2.6.4

Application Level of Trust

A Level of Trust is a label which simplifies the communication between actors from different domains, with
different forms of involvement in application security within an organization. It is defined by an organization for
the purpose of unambiguously identifying a particular set of controls.
EXAMPLE 1

In Figure 5, the organization has defined six levels of trust, represented by the rightmost columns labeled "0" to "5".

EXAMPLE 2
In Figure 5, Level of Trust "1" identifies a set of three ASCs pertaining to online payment, privacy laws and SSL
connections. Furthermore, ASCs pertaining to secure logging and wireless, defined in Level of Trust zero, also apply at level 1, as shown
by arrows ending with a blue dot.

An application’s Level of Trust is not the result of a calculation, unlike the concept of risk, which is the
calculated result of a risk analysis. Level of Trust is thus not complementary to risk.
Rather, a Level of Trust is similar to the concept of a “security plan”, which is a set of controls authorized by
an organization in order to reduce the risk that was determined by a risk analysis. For any given organization,
each Level of Trust is thus similar to a pre-defined, re-usable security plan.
The organization should define its own range (or domain, or scale) of Levels of Trust that the organization’s
ONF committee should authorize as possible values for an application's Targeted Level of Trust. This range
can be defined in any way that suits the organization.
EXAMPLE 3
An organization might use, as in the example in Figure 5, numeric levels from 0 to 5. Another organization might use a
domain of defined values such as [low, medium high], [green, yellow, red]. Another organization might use criteria based on risk
acceptance criteria.

The organization should define a minimum acceptable Level of Trust for each of its applications.
ISO/IEC 27034 uses the name “level zero of trust” to identify the minimum acceptable level of trust (as
opposed to the maximum acceptable risk). An organization may use any name for this level of trust.
The organization should monitor the Level of Trust achieved by applications and take corrective action if any
application falls below level zero at any time, especially after the application has been deployed.
EXAMPLE 4
In Figure 5, the ONF committee has defined an ASC at level zero of trust for any application using secure logs or
wireless transmission. Even if the application's Targeted Level of Trust determined by the risk analysis for this application is the level zero
of trust, this ASC should still be performed.

8.1.2.6.5
8.1.2.6.5.1

Application Security Control
General

The Application Security Control is a central concept in ISO/IEC 27034. It is used for introducing security
activities into the application’s life cycle and articulates the supporting evidence needed to verify its successful
application.
The concept of security control is widely used in the information security industry. Thousands of relevant
security controls are published and widely available from sources such as ISO/IEC 15408-3 and NIST Special
Publication 800-53.

ISO/IEC 27034-1:2011(E)

An ASC is a security control used in application projects, defined using a precise structure presented in the
following sub clauses. Annex B provides an example illustrating how security controls from NIST SP 800-53
can be described using the ASC structure.
For organizations having implemented the concept of assurance case as defined in ISO/IEC TR 15026-2,
ASCs are useful for simplified management and timely provision of evidence needed to support claims and
arguments about the security of an application. Further support to arguments is provided by the organization’s
consistent use of processes proposed by this IS for the creation, approval and use of each ASC. Because the
whole set of ASCs selected for the application project originates from the application security risk analysis, it
directly supports top-level claims, justifications and arguments about the security of the application.
ASCs can be used for:
a) securing application components, including software, data, COTS and infrastructure;
b) adding security activities to processes used during stages in the application's life cycle;
c) verifying roles, responsibilities and professional qualifications of all actors involved in a project;
d) determining evaluation/acceptance criteria for components; and
e) helping to determine the application's Actual Level of Trust.
Figure 6 shows that the ASC provides the application project team with a security activity (i.e., to reduce or
limit a specific security risk, and the verification team with a verification measurement activity (i.e., to confirm
that the corresponding security activity has been successfully performed by examining the supporting
evidence).

Figure 6 – Components of an ASC
The activity portion of the ASC specifies how security issues for the application project are addressed.
The measurement portion of the ASC specifies how to provide evidence that the activity was performed
correctly, by a qualified actor, and that the expected results were obtained.
Both the activity and the measurement provide an estimated cost which will help the organization to evaluate
and approve the total cost of security controls in regard to the Targeted Level of Trust.
ASCs can be linked together in a graph, so that, once the activity in an ASC has been performed, it can be
followed by the activities of children ASCs. This ASC characteristic is useful for:
a) providing only relevant information to the different actors, by concealing unnecessary complexity;
b) facilitating communication by grouping relevant ASCs under headings using appropriate vocabulary,
for example, using business-level language when communicating with managers;
c) facilitating distribution of ASCs by grouping them into related sets; and
d) ensuring that all security activities in linked ASCs are performed and none are bypassed.

NOTE
Although ISO/IEC 27034-5 will formalize the structure of the ASC, organizations may still refer to ISO/IEC 15289 for guidance
on specifying information items to be produced during their applications' life cycles.

8.1.2.6.5.2

ASC Identification

The ASC identification section contains information such as:
a) ASC information: ASC name, ID, author, date, description, etc.;
b) pointers to parent and children ASCs (an ASC can be represented as a graph structure); and
c) pointers to the relevant business, regulatory, and technological contexts, as well as the application
specifications that provide the security requirements for this ASC (see Figure 5).
8.1.2.6.5.3

ASC Objective

The ASC objective specifies “why” this ASC exists, namely the security requirements for which this ASC was
designed.
The ASC objective specifies:
a) which elements of its security activity need to produce supporting evidence for their corresponding
verification measurements;
b) for which levels of trust the ASC is mandatory;
c) application specifications or requirements with which the ASC is associated, and which can refer to
applicable regulations, standards and best practices; and
d) security threats and assumptions about the application’s operating environment.
An ASC can be associated with several levels of trust.
EXAMPLE In Figure 5, an ASC has been defined at the level 1 of trust for any applications involving online payment. This ASC is
mandatory for all projects which develop an application involving online payment where a Targeted Level of Trust from 1 to 2 has been

assigned by the application owner. If the application owner wishes to assign the application a targeted level 3 of trust, then an ASC with a
stronger security activity and/or measurement is needed.

8.1.2.6.5.4

ASC Security Activity

This element describes the steps or procedures required to implement the activity. It should define at the very
least:
a) What: 1) complete description of the security activity;
2) activity’s complexity;
3) artefacts produced by this activity. This artefact articulates the supporting evidence
necessary to demonstrate the presence of the introduced application security control
processes or procedures (i.e., the ASC activity);
4) expected ASC activity outcomes (namely, a description of the resulting situation, status or
precise artefact value produced by the activity);
b) How:

technique for performing this activity and obtaining the artefact, such as identification of
source code used for implementing secure connections to a LDAP service, identification of
library used for encryption, or document providing guidance for performing the activity;

c) Where: the target of the security activity, such as source code, application parameters, infrastructure
component, process.
d) Who:

required qualifications for actors who should perform this activity. Actors are subjected to
ASCs (possibly in the form of formal organizational appointments) because the organization
should ensure that the required professional qualifications for each role are attained, and that
the principle of separation of duties is respected. ASCs should be written for the express
purpose of verifying professional qualifications;

e) When: pointer to a specific activity in a stage in the Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model
(see 8.1.2.7) where this activity should be performed;
f)

How much: estimated cost to perform this ASC activity.

8.1.2.6.5.5

ASC Verification Measurement

This part presents the verification control that is performed for verifying the successful performance of the
corresponding ASC activity. The Verification Measurement should define at least:
a) What: 1) complete description of the security measurement. This description specifies how to verify
the existence and correctness of the artefact produced by its ASC activity;
2) measurement complexity;
3) artefact produced by this measurement. This artefact articulates the supporting evidence
necessary to demonstrate that the ASC has been verified;
4) expected results (situation, status or precise artefact value description); and
b) How:

technique for performing this measurement and obtaining the artefact, such as code review
tools and settings, or document providing guidance for performing the measurement;

c) Where: the target of the verification activity, namely the precise characteristics of the artefact
produced by corresponding ASC activity that are being verified.
d) Who:

professional qualifications required for actors involved in the verification control. Actors are
subjected to ASCs (possibly in the form of formal organizational appointments) because the
organization should ensure that required professional qualifications for each role are attained,
and that the principle of separation of duties is respected. ASCs should be written for the
express purpose of verifying professional qualifications;

e) When: a pointer to a a specific activity in a stage in the Application Security Life Cycle Reference
Model (see 8.1.2.7) where this measurement should be performed. This measurement can be
performed periodically if required;
f)

How much: estimated cost to perform one occurrence of this verification measurement activity.

8.1.2.7.1

Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model
General

An organization whose business involves developing, outsourcing or acquiring applications generally uses a
framework of defined processes and activities organized into stages. This framework is commonly named “life
cycle model”. Depending on the context, it is referred to as either “application life cycle model”, “system life
cycle model” or “software life cycle model”. It is not a new concept brought by ISO/IEC 27034. Its definition is
found in International Standards ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 15288.
Such a framework is unique and customized for a particular organization. It has been in use and refined over
the years.
A specific application’s life cycle, i.e. the evolution of the application from conception through retirement, is an
instantiation of the organization’s life cycle model.
It is possible for different groups within complex organizations to use different application life cycle models for
different projects. Such is often the case in large organizations which are formed through mergers or which
are decentralized. Other organizations have developed different specialized application life cycle models
related to specific application contexts such as web applications, real-time applications, embedded
applications, medical applications, etc.
Activities performed during stages in a software or system life cycle are part of organization-wide processes
which should be compatible with the normative requirements provided in ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 15288.
In addition, ISO/IEC TR 24748 provides additional guidance and describes models for system and software
development life cycles, life cycle stages and their relationship to life cycle processes.
ISO/IEC 27034 does not impose or even recommend a change in the organization’s application life cycle
model. ISO/IEC 27034 instead adds activities called “Application Security Controls” (ASCs) to the activities
usually performed in the stages defined by the organization’s application life cycle model.
As previously discussed in 8.1.2.6.5, ASCs include pointers to specific point in a stage in the life cycle, thus
specifying “when” security activities and verification measurements should be performed.
Currently, there are many software and system life cycle models from which an organization can choose for its
internal needs. It is neither possible nor desirable for ISO/IEC 27034 to refer to all of them or to prefer one
over another. It is thus impossible to have an ASC in the standard pointing directly to a stage, process or
activity in a particular life cycle model. This would make the ASC concept of ISO/IEC 27034 less portable to
organizations in the wider community.
The solution to this problem is to present an Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model as a
standardized reference for the addition of ASCs to activities performed for application management,
application provisioning and operation, infrastructure management and application audit. This model is a
representation of generic stages and activities commonly found in application life cycle models.
This model is not limited to software development. It also makes references to activities from other domains
such as governance, software and infrastructure maintenance, project management, audit and control.
The purpose of the Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model is to:
a) help the organization to validate each of its application life cycles by specifying all processes and
actors potentially involved in application security;
b) help the organization to ensure that the security concerns are correctly addressed at all stages of its
application life cycles;
c) help the organization to minimize the cost and impact of introducing ISO/IEC 27034 practices in its
application projects by maintaining existing application life cycles;
d) provide the organization with a standard model for sharing ASCs between its application project
teams, despite differing application life cycles; and
e) provide organizations with a standard model for sharing ASCs with other organizations, despite
differing application life cycles.

Figure 8 shows a graphical representation of the Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model proposed
by ISO/IEC 27034.

Figure 8 – Top-level view of the Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model
The organization should define a persistent mapping between the stages and activities defined in this
reference model and the stages and activities already in use in each of the organization’s own model(s). This
provides a way to indicate at which point in the organization’s own stages and activities ASCs are applied.
The organization’s ONF committee will determine the placement of ASCs in the Application Security Life
Cycle Reference Model. This act of allocation ensures that minimally acceptable ASCs for the Targeted Level
of Trust are uniformly followed during the instigation planning for every application project in the organization.
This reference model is divided horizontally into two main stages: Provisioning, during which activities are
performed for obtaining and deploying an application, and Operation, during which post-deployment activities
are performed.
Provisioning and Operation stages can be further divided into stages as follows:
a) Provisioning stages consist of three stages: Preparation, Realization and Transition;
b) Operation stages consist of three stages: Utilization and maintenance, Archival and Destruction.
This reference model is divided vertically into four main layers:
a) Application management: this layer comprises activities from the governance domain, such as project
management and application operation management. Such activities are usually performed within
processes defined in the organization’s ISMS;
b) application provisioning and operation: this layer comprises activities relating to the provisioning and
use of the application itself. Such activities are usually performed within processes recommended by
standards such as ISO/IEC 15026 Series, ISO/IEC 15288, ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 21827;
c) infrastructure management: this layer comprises activities relating to the organization’s IT service
management infrastructure supporting the application. Such activities are usually performed within
processes recommended by standards such as ISO/IEC TR 20000-4; and guidance products, such as
ITIL; and

d) application audit: this layer comprises activities relating to control and verification. Such activities are
usually performed within processes recommended by standards such as ISO/IEC 15288,
ISO/IEC 12207 and industry practice documents, such as CobiT.
Actors represent all persons involved in all stages of all layers of the model, such as project managers,
developers, system administrators, database administrators, user managers, application owners, auditors,
end-users, support technicians, network administrators, etc.
Activities usually performed in the stages of the Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model and shown in
Figure 8 are described as follows.
8.1.2.7.2

Application provisioning management

Application provisioning management activities are carried out by project managers and organizational
managers, during the provisioning stages of the application life cycle.
Such activities are usually performed as part of organization-wide processes. These include software
engineering processes from the Project processes group defined by ISO/IEC 12207, such as
Human Resource Management Process, Project Planning Process, Project Assessment and Control Process,
and Decision Management Process.
8.1.2.7.3

Application operation management

Application operation management activities are related to the management and use of the application during
the operation stages.
Such activities are usually performed as part of organization-wide processes. These include software
engineering processes from ISO/IEC 12207 such as Decision Management Process and Information
Management Process.
Usually, an application is under the responsibility of its owner who may elect to share some of this
responsibility with other actors such as user managers.
Changes to the application during operation stages, such as changes stemming from new regulatory
requirements or threats, should be initiated by the application owner, who is responsible of ensuring that the
application correctly and continuously addresses the organization’s changing security needs.
Through these processes, the application owner will provide the organization’s ISMS with the needed
assurance and evidence that the governance of application projects is being addressed.
8.1.2.7.4

Preparation

During the preparation stage, the provisioning team carries out preliminary or preparation activities. Such
activities are usually performed as part of organization-wide processes. These include software engineering
processes from ISO/IEC 12207 such as subclauses 6.3.3 Decision Management Process and
6.3.6 Information Management Process.
8.1.2.7.5

Preparation processes

This set of processes includes activities performed during the preparation stage of an application project.
NOTE
These processes include software engineering processes from ISO/IEC 12207 such as subclauses 6.4.1 Stakeholder
Requirements Definition Process, System Requirements Analysis and Risk Management.

8.1.2.7.6

Outsourcing

During the realization stage, activities related to the implementation of software are performed by the
provisioning team. If the organization is outsourcing some implementation activities, it might need to add
specific ASCs to its implementation activities in order to achieve the application’s Targeted Level of Trust. For
this reason, the Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model presents a specific activities area for
outsourcing.
Such activities are usually performed as part of organization-wide processes. These include software
engineering processes from ISO/IEC 12207 such as Acquisition Process, Software Documentation
Management Process, Software Configuration Management Process and Risk Management Process.

8.1.2.7.7

Development

Activities related to the implementation of software are performed by the provisioning team during the
realization stage. If the organization is performing internally some implementation activities, the ASCs added
to its implementation activities might be different from those added when purchasing or outsourcing the
implementation or application components. For this reason, the Application Security Life Cycle Reference
Model presents a specific area for development activities resulting in the implementation of internally
developed software.
Such activities are usually performed as part of organization-wide processes. These include software
engineering processes from ISO/IEC 12207 such as Risk Management Process, System Architectural Design,
Software Architectural Design Process, Software Detailed Design Process, Software Construction Process,
Software Documentation Management Process, Software Configuration Management Process, Software
Verification Process, Software Validation Process, Software Review Process, Domain Engineering Process
and Reuse Asset Management Process.
8.1.2.7.8

Acquisition

Acquisition activities may be carried out by the provisioning team for the purpose of obtaining externally or
purchasing the product and/or service that satisfies the needs of the organization. Specific ASCs may be
added to those activities. For this reason, the Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model presents a
specific area for acquisition activities resulting in the implementation of acquired application components.
Such activities are usually performed as part of organization-wide processes. These include software
engineering processes from ISO/IEC 12207 such as Acquisition Process, Software Documentation
Management Process, Software Configuration Management Process, Risk Management Process and
Implementation Process.
8.1.2.7.9

Transition

This area in the Transition stage includes activities performed by the provisioning team for preparing,
configuring, testing and deploying the application in the operating environment defined by the organization.
Such activities are usually performed as part of organization-wide processes. These include software
engineering processes from ISO/IEC 12207 such as Software Configuration Management Process, System
Integration Process and System Qualification Testing Process.
8.1.2.7.10 Utilization
During the Utilization and maintenance stage, activities involved in the actual use of the application in the
operating environment by all users including end-users. Such activities include user and access management,
logging, monitoring, security training, etc.
Other activities are carried out for software maintenance and change management, including the updating of
application software in order to meet changing information requirements, such as adding new functions and
changing data formats. It also includes fixing bugs and adapting the software to new hardware devices.
Such activities are usually performed as part of organization-wide processes. These include software
engineering processes from ISO/IEC 12207 such as Software Operation Process and Software Maintenance
Process.
8.1.2.7.11 Archival
Archival activities are performed by the operation team when the application is no longer needed in its active
state. They include the archival of all the application’s information, including the archival of all tools and
processes to protect and securely access this information even if the application is not running in the
operating environment anymore.
Such activities are usually performed as part of organization-wide processes. These include software
engineering processes from ISO/IEC 12207 such as the Software Disposal Process.

8.1.2.7.12 Destruction
Destruction activities are involved in the secure destruction of all the application’s information, including user
data, organization’s information, user logs, application parameters, etc.
Such activities are usually performed as part of organization-wide processes. These include software
engineering processes from ISO/IEC 12207 such as the Software Disposal Process.
8.1.2.7.13 Application provisioning infrastructure management
This activities area in the provisioning stages includes activities involved in providing and maintaining a secure
technological infrastructure in support to the activities of the provisioning team. This includes services,
facilities, tools, and communications and information technology assets in the development environment and
various test environments.
Such activities are usually performed as part of organization-wide processes. These include software
engineering processes from ISO/IEC 12207 such as Infrastructure Management Process and Configuration
Management Process.
8.1.2.7.14 Application operation infrastructure management
This activities area in the provisioning stages includes activities involved in providing and maintaining a secure
technological infrastructure for the operation stages of an application’s life cycle. This includes services,
facilities, tools, and communications and information technology assets in the application’s operating
environment.
Other activities should also be carried out during the operation stages for the secure maintenance of the
infrastructure supporting the application. Infrastructure maintenance includes system and network hardware
maintenance, backup and recovery, disaster recovery, etc.
Such activities are usually performed as part of organization-wide processes. These include system
engineering processes from ISO/IEC 15288 such as Operation Process and Maintenance Process.
8.1.2.7.15 Disposal
Disposal activities are carried out in order to provide an assurance that all information stored on the servers,
systems and others technological components used by an application are securely deleted. This allows for the
disposal or recycling of these components without undue security risk for the organization.
Such activities are usually performed as part of organization-wide processes. These include system
engineering processes from ISO/IEC 15288 such as the Disposal Process.
8.1.2.7.16 Application provisioning audit
Audit activities are performed on all activities, actors, processes, artefacts and application components used
or produced during the application’s life cycle.
These activities may be performed once or periodically by internal or external audit teams, depending on the
Targeted Level of Trust of the application project. They provide the application owner with the needed
assurance and evidence that security requirements for the application are met as expected.
Audit activities performed during the provisioning stages are usually different from those carried out during the
operation stages. Organizations developing but not operating applications (such as software vendors) might
never need to audit applications in operation stages. For this reason, the Application Security Life Cycle
Reference Model presents a specific area for audit activities performed during provisioning stages.
Such activities are usually performed as part of organization-wide processes. These include software
engineering processes from ISO/IEC 12207 such as Software Audit Process.
8.1.2.7.17 Application operation audit
Audit activities performed during the operation stages are usually different from those carried out during the
provisioning stages. Organizations operating only acquired applications might never need to audit applications
in provisioning stages. For this reason, the Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model presents a
specific area for audit activities performed during operation stages.

8.1.2.8

Processes related to application security

The ONF is the repository for all processes used by the organization. As a result, all of the processes related
to the definition, management and verification of application security in the organization should be described
in a formal manner in the ONF, including:
a) all processes described in ISO/IEC 27034 in clause 8 of this part of ISO/IEC 27034;
b) all processes described in subsequent parts of ISO/IEC 27034;
c) all processes referred to in ASCs such as incident response plans, business continuity plans, code
review procedures and vulnerability testing procedures.
8.1.3
8.1.3.1

Processes related to the Organization Normative Framework
General

Organizational contexts evolve over time. Because of this, ONF components representing these contexts
(such as technological, business and regulatory contexts and application specifications) should be kept up to
date.
The organization’s ONF committee should define, document and authorize processes for creating, approving
and maintaining the ONF and all of its components. Roles, responsibilities and required professional
qualifications for actors involved in these processes should be specified. For example, Figure 9 shows an
overview of the ONF maintenance process.
These processes are mentioned in the present overview and will be discussed in more detail in
ISO/IEC 27034-2.

The ONF Management Process (Figure 9) and its sub-processes are permanent, organization-wide processes
carried out by the organization’s ONF committee. These processes are independent from, and are performed
in parallel with, the organization’s application projects, as shown in Figure 3.

Goals of the ONF Management Process include:
a) ensuring that application security needs and the approval of the ASC library and the levels of trust,
especially level zero of trust, are still aligned with the organization’s business needs;
b) ensuring that ONF components are updated to reflect changes originating outside the organization; for
example, changes to laws can change the regulatory context defined in the ONF;
c) securing high-management approval of all organization-wide security policies and senior management
acknowledgement of the importance of all ONF components;
d) ensuring approved ASCs are adequately and uniformly applied in an organization-wide manner;
e) communicating ONF components to all teams in the organization; and
f)

providing feedback to the ONF to include new knowledge, ASC improvement suggestions and new
practices gained over the course of an application project.

8.1.3.3

ONF Management subprocesses

All application security-related processes should be part of the ONF. They should also be compliant with the
organization’s ISMS. The following table shows how application-security-related ONF management
subprocesses map to the four stages of the ISMS process.

As shown in Table 2, the ONF Management Process can be divided into different subprocesses as follows:
a) Designing the ONF: establishing the application-security-related components of the ONF, including
the ASMP, the ASC Library and all related processes;
1) specifying and documenting the possible contexts (business, regulatory and technological) in
which the applications will be used;
2) creating, documenting and maintaining the application specifications repository:
a. analyzing the specifications for each new application during the supply stage;
b. analyzing the specifications of existing applications in the organization;
3) specifying actors and processes:
a. analyzing and documenting people and processes involved in the complete
application life cycle;
b. specifying (or developing) and approving a formal application-level risk analysis
methodology based in ISO/IEC 27005;

ISO/IEC 27034-1:2011(E)

4) analyzing relevant best practices and standards such as ISO/IEC 12207, ISO/IEC 15288 and
ISO/IEC 15026 Series and defining ASCs from this analysis;
a. ASC creation and update;
When required by the organization, an ASC is created or updated to address specific
security requirements.
Domain experts should define the security activity and the verification measurement,
as discussed in 8.1.2.6.5.
EXAMPLE 1 An ASC required to enforce software code security should be created or updated by a
senior programmer competent in a specific programming language.
EXAMPLE 2 An ASC required to enforce an application identity management process should be created
or updated by an identity management specialist.

b. ASC validation and integration;
A verification team, composed of senior managers and expert developers, IT
personnel and auditors, should be responsible for validating an ASC, ensuring it will
be clearly understandable for those who use it, and for validating that this ASC in fact
mitigates the defined risk. The verification team should also specify at which defined
levels of trust this ASC is required.
Approval of all ASCs falls under the ultimate responsibility of the ONF committee.
5) analyzing, comparing to the Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model and, as
required, adapting the organization’s current application life cycle model and other processes;
6) defining and implementing the organization's ASC Library;
7) acquiring (or developing), updating and validating ASCs required by the organization and
integrating them into the ASC Library;
8) analyzing, adapting and validating feedback from application projects;
b) Implementing the ONF: implementing and communicating the ONF;
c) Monitoring and reviewing the ONF: ensuring application projects correctly use the ONF
components and gathering feedback from projects:
1) requiring a Targeted Level of Trust and an Actual Level of Trust for all applications used by
the organization;
2) requiring a periodic application risk assessment for all applications used by the organization;
and
d) Continually improving the ONF: maintaining and improving all components in the ONF, by
periodically reviewing the organization-wide contexts, people, processes and technology, finding all
changes with a possible impact on the ASMP and integrating them into the ONF.

8.2
8.2.1

Application security risk assessment
Risk assessment vs risk management

Risk assessment is the second step of the risk management process described in ISO/IEC 27005. By the
same token, application security risk assessment is the second step of the ASMP, which applies the risk
assessment process at the application level. Other steps of risk management are performed by other steps of
the ASMP.
According to ISO/IEC 27005, “Risk assessment determines the value of the information assets, identifies the
applicable threats and vulnerabilities that exist (or could exist), identifies the existing controls and their effect
on the risk identified, determines the potential consequences and finally prioritizes the derived risks and ranks
them against the risk evaluation criteria set in the context establishment.”
Risk assessment includes three sub-steps: risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation.

8.2.2
8.2.2.1

Application risk analysis
High-level application risk analysis

This is a high level risk analysis performed during the preparation stage of the application’s life cycle. It
defines, in a simple “rule of thumb” manner, the application's Targeted Level of Trust according to the basic
application specifications and the application’s technological, regulatory, and business contexts.
The owner of the specific application project should appoint an explicit role with the responsibility of
performing this analysis using an adequate methodology for an application-level analysis. An organizationlevel risk analysis methodology might not suffice for this task.
8.2.2.2

Detailed application risk analysis

This is performed during the realization stage of the application’s life cycle. It identifies more precisely the
residual risks associated with the specific application before considering any ASCs for the application and
reconfirms the application's Targeted Level of Trust (defined during the high-level application risk analysis) for
this application according to the detailed application specifications and the organization’s technological,
regulatory, and business contexts for the application.
As a result of this detailed application risk analysis, the application owner might change the application's
Targeted Level of Trust for the application project. This changes the ASCs selected for the project, which has
an impact on actors involved and the estimated cost of the project. However, such impacts are easily
predicted since such information as actors, professional qualifications and estimated cost is already part of
each ASC and has already been documented in the organization’s ASC library.
The owner of the specific application project should appoint an explicit role with the responsibility of
performing this analysis using an appropriate methodology for an application-level analysis. An organizationlevel risk analysis methodology might not be adequate for this task.
8.2.3

Risk Evaluation

According to ISO/IEC 27005, “Risk evaluation uses the understanding of risk obtained by risk analysis to
make decisions about future actions. Decisions should include:
a) Whether an activity should be undertaken; and
b) Priorities for risk treatment considering estimated levels of risks.“
In ISO/IEC 27034, this step takes the form of selecting the application's Targeted Level of Trust, which in turn
determines which ASCs should be implemented for risk treatment.
8.2.4

Application's Targeted Level of Trust

The application's Targeted Level of Trust can aid in achieving the level of confidence required by the
organization in order to use or deploy the application in a secure manner, after accepting the residual risks
determined by the risk assessment.
The application's Targeted Level of Trust is vital to the security of the application because it directly
determines the appropriate ASCs to be selected from the ASC library and implemented in the application's life
cycle.
The risk assessment process produces the security requirements from which the application's Targeted Level
of Trust is derived. This in turn becomes the goal for the application's project team.
The application's Targeted Level of Trust should be one of (or within the range of) the levels of trust defined in
the Organization ASC Library (see 8.1.2.6), which is part of the ONF.
The ASC library (Figure 5) can be represented as a table and the application's Targeted Level of Trust as a
column in that table. Thus selecting a level of trust involves selecting all ASCs in that column.
8.2.5

Application owner acceptation

The application owner has the responsibility of accepting the residual risks associated with a specific
application.

31

ISO/IEC 27034-1:2011(E)

The application owner performs this acceptation in two ways:
a) by approving the application's Targeted Level of Trust in step 2 of the ASMP; and
b) by approving the results of the application security audit in step 5 of the ASMP, in which the
application's Actual Level of Trust is measured and compared to the application's Targeted Level of
Trust. This step can be required at any time by the application owner. For additional validation, the
application owner can require this step to be performed by an external verification team.
Once the owner has performed this acceptation, it is the project team’s responsibility to achieve the
application's Targeted Level of Trust by implementing the relevant ASCs at the appropriate stages in the life
cycle.

8.3
8.3.1

Application Normative Framework
General

The Application Normative Framework (ANF) is a subset or refinement of the ONF that contains only the
detailed information as required for a specific application to reach the Targeted Level of Trust required by the
application owner during the final acceptation process element of step 2 of the ASMP.
Security requirements in the ANF are derived from the assessment of risks associated with the organization’s
use of the application performed in step 2 of the ASMP.
For each application project, the ANF is created and completed with the relevant technological, regulatory and
business contexts, application specifications and appropriate ASCs.
This ANF exists throughout the application’s life cycle and can evolve over time. For example, the regulatory
context for the application can change during the course of the project, or the application owner might give the
application project team a new Targeted Level of Trust. In these cases, new elements can be added to or
removed from the ANF by the organization.
Changes to the ANF have an impact on the application’s security. These changes should receive
corresponding approvals from the application owner.
The ANF for a specific application project contains the components detailed below. Figure 10 shows a
graphical representation of the ANF.

8.3.2
8.3.2.1

Components
Business context associated with the application's environment

All business processes, methodologies, standards and actors involved in the application project, including
external business processes required to provide adequate business integrity in operating environments, are
derived or refined from the organization’s ONF business context (see 8.1.2.1) for the application.
8.3.2.2

Regulatory context associated with the application's environment

All legal and regulatory requirements applicable in the location(s) where the application is used or deployed
are refined or derived from the organization’s ONF Regulatory context (see 8.1.2.2) for the application.
8.3.2.3

Technological context associated with the application's environment

All technological components of the application, such as its architecture, infrastructure, protocols and
languages, are derived or refined from the organization’s ONF technological context (see 8.1.2.4) for the
application.
8.3.2.4

Application specifications

Application specifications take the form of functional, non functional and security requirements.
All data used, stored, computed, shared or transferred by the application should be listed and categorized.
This includes organizational data, user data, configuration data, parameters and other data used by the
application. This also includes any output from the application.
8.3.2.5

Application actors: roles, responsibilities and qualifications

All actors who interact with the application during its life cycle should be determined. Actors include security
officers, application owners, project managers, audit officers, architects, testers, developers, end users,
administrators, database administrators and technicians.
8.3.2.6

Selected ASCs for the application's life cycle

As seen in 8.1.2.6, the precise and detailed ASCs for a specific application project are selected from the
organization ASC library, according to the following criteria:
a) the application's Targeted Level of Trust;
b) the organization’s requirements for the application; and
c) the application’s specific contexts and specifications.
Each ASC provides both a security activity performed by the application project team to mitigate a specific
security risk, and a verification measurement performed by the verification team to confirm that the
corresponding security activity has been successfully carried out by examining the supporting evidence. Each
ASC also provides pointers to specific stages in the application life cycle where said activity and measurement
is to be performed.
ASCs are defined and approved by the organization prior to development. Developers will no longer need to
design them for each new application project. This ensures a constant approach by the organization in
addressing application security requirements.
Selected ASCs should include at a minimum all the ASCs that the ONF committee has authorized for level
zero of trust, which is defined as the minimum level of trust the organization will accept. The ASCs authorized
for level zero of trust should not be changed by the project team in the course of an application project.
8.3.3

Processes related to the security of the application

All relevant processes related to the definition, management and verification of application security, as
described in ISO/IEC 27034, should be included in the ANF. This is a refinement of the “Processes related to
application security” component of the ONF, as described in subclause 8.1.2.8.

8.3.4

Application's life cycle

The application life cycle component designates the stages and activities selected from the ONF for a specific
application project. More specifically, the application's life cycle is a subset of the Application Security Life
Cycle Reference Model (see 8.1.2.7) contained in the ONF.
The application life cycle and its standard counterpart the Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model
have already been discussed in 8.1.2.7.
It is via the various processes used during the application's life cycle, with which the project and verification
teams are already familiar, that the activities and measurements defined by the ASCs are performed.
The preferred approach is therefore to smoothly integrate ASCs as integral parts of processes used during the
application life cycle, rather than as distinct external security activities.
8.3.5
8.3.5.1

Processes
Processes related to the Application Normative Framework

The organization should define and document processes for creating, approving and maintaining the ANF.
Roles, responsibilities and required professional qualifications for actors involved in the organization’s ANF for
the specific application should be specified.
The ANF creation process for a specific application is vital. This process transforms the generic information
contained in the ONF into specific information required by the ANF for a specific application and its
requirements.
While ASCs in the ONF are linked to stages of the Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model, ASCs in
the ANF are linked to stages in the a specific application's life cycle.
8.3.5.2

Feedback process

The organization should define a process for continuously improving the ONF through feedback of new
knowledge, application security control improvement suggestions and practices gained in the course of an
application’s development and deployment.
This process is shown on Figure 3 as “Provides feedback to”.
This process should tie into an ONF maintenance process shown in Figure 9 as “Feedback from previous and
current business and application projects”.

8.4 Provisioning and operating the application
8.4.1

General

The fourth step of the ASMP involves the deployment and follow-up within the application project of the
specific ASCs provided by the ANF. Specifically, the application's project team implements the specific
security activities described in the ASC “Security Activity” part (as explained in 8.1.2.6.5.4) for each ASC
contained in the application’s ANF.
This step is made easier for the project and verification teams by supplying them only those ASCs required to
reach the Targeted Level of Trust for their specific project. It is not necessary for the teams to be aware of the
processes leading to the ANF’s.
Project managers will find the ASC to be an efficient tool because it details required tasks, resources and
qualifications, the cost per task in days-person and the exact stage in the life cycle at which each task should
be performed.
The verification team will also find the ASC an efficient tool because it provides detailed information about
what verification measurements should be performed to provide evidence that security activities have been
performed correctly with expected results. This allows the verification team to make sure the application meets
the security requirements, though the formal recording of the supporting evidence.

The security and technology teams will also find the ASC concept useful because the ASCs contained in a
specific application’s ANF provide a detailed list of security requirements, thus allowing advance planning of
required resources.
8.4.2

Impact of ISO/IEC 27034 on an application project

A typical application project (prior to an organization’s implementation of ISO/IEC 27034) is driven by a project
team, supported by processes, often automated by technology, with the goal of generating an application.
Usually, the quality assurance team follows a test plan to verify the application functionalities against the
accepted functional requirements.
The technology itself, the development methodology used by the project team, the process maturity, the
quality of the artefacts produced, and the qualifications of the actors involved in the project are rarely verified
and such verification processes, if performed, are usually not formally defined.

Figure 11 – Impact of ISO/IEC 27034 on roles and responsibilities
in a typical application project
Figure 11 shows how roles and responsibilities will be formally specified henceforth. It also shows two vital
new components: the ONF and the ANF. The ONF, an organization-wide framework, is not acting directly on
the application project. The project team, the verification team and the users will only be impacted by the ANF,
a project-specific framework that provides precise and detailed Application Security Controls and
corresponding verification measurements.
A verification team has the responsibility of verifying the ONF. This is not only done at the project level (see
8.4.4.2) but at the organization level as well, as part of the ONF Management Process (see 8.1.3.3.d)).

Figure 13 – ASC used as a measurement
Figure 13 shows that the verification measurement part of an Application Security Control is used as a control
gate in an application project’s life cycle for the verification team to verify and validate the application and the
project, and provide advice to the application owner so that he can decide whether or not to authorize the
application project to proceed to its next step of execution. For example, an ASC might require that a server
clustering service be used to ensure the application availability. The verification measurement part of the ASC
verifies that such a service was indeed implemented correctly.
Figure 13 also shows that the verification measurement part of an ASC can be used to verify the qualifications
of the actors performing the application life cycle activities. For example, an ASC may require that a senior
developer implement an application critical component. The verification measurement part of the ASC verifies
the qualifications of the developer who implemented the component.

Application Security Audit
General

The purpose of this fifth ASMP step is to verify and formally record the supporting evidence of whether or not
a specific application has attained and is maintaining the application's Targeted Level of Trust.
This step of the ASMP can be performed at any time during the application’s life cycle. Depending on the
application's Targeted Level of Trust, this step can be one-off, periodic or event-driven.
EXAMPLE 1
An organization could periodically perform this step to monitor the status of security implementation during the realization
stage of an application.
EXAMPLE 2
An organization could perform this step to demonstrate an application's Actual Level of Trust before it can be approved
for deployment.
EXAMPLE 3
An organization could perform this step during the operation stages of an application's life cycle as part of the
organization’s annual security audit.

In this step, an internal or external verification team (depending on organizational policies contained in the
ONF) verifies that all verification measurements provided by all the ASCs in the ANF for the specific
application have been performed and that the results were verified. The purpose of this step is to demonstrate
the application's Actual Level of Trust at a specific time. An organization can declare an application “secure”
when its Actual Level of Trust is equal to its Targeted Level of Trust.
This step corresponds to the “risk acceptance” step in the risk management process established by
ISO/IEC 27005.

Components
Application's Actual Level of trust

The application's Actual Level of Trust is the maximum confidence level demonstrated by the verification team
according to the verification measurements of all the application’s ASCs.
Each ASC included in the ANF for any given application project provides a specific and detailed measurement
activity to be performed by the verification team, along with a pointer to the specific stage in the application life
cycle during which the measurement is to be performed.
The application's Actual Level of Trust is obtained by verifying the ASCs that ought to be completed at a
specific point in the application’s life cycle. If any ASC fails verification, the organization should take
appropriate measures to correct the situation.
Successful achievement of the application's Targeted Level of Trust is confirmed when verification of
supporting evidence from the verification measurement activities of all expected ASCs has been successfully
performed.
Following this confirmation, the application is considered secure by the organization for use or deployment
from the specific moment of the achievement until the moment of the next verification mandated by the
periodical revision requirement of step 5 of the ASMP or by other organizational requirements.

Annex A
(informative)
Mapping an existing development process to ISO/IEC 27034 Case Study

A.1

General

The purpose of this annex is to illustrate with an example how an actual security-focused software
development process (the SDL) can successfully map to several components and processes of
ISO/IEC 27034.
Unless specifically noted, this case study assumes that all activities and performance outcomes discussed
conform to ISO/IEC 27034.
This Annex will illustrate the following concepts in support of ISO/IEC 27034;
a) A short overview of the Security Development Lifecycle
b) A mapping of security development practices to the Organization Normative Framework. In particular,
this Annex:
1) explains the interconnections between the technological, business and regulatory contexts;
2) discusses the processes for creating and maintaining application specifications;
3) outlines the roles and responsibilities for various individuals involved in the application
development process;
4) shows the Application Security Controls (ASCs) in place;
5) discusses the Application Security Verification process;
6) provides a visual illustration of the Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model;
7) provides examples of additional activities an organization using SDL might have to perform in
order to comply with ISO/IEC 27034.
For ease of review, verbatim descriptions of the controls outlined in this part of ISO/IEC 27034 are referenced
in text boxes for each section below; each of them is then followed by an example of its application.
Wherever possible, references to public sources of information are provided; web links to specific discussions
of processes, tools and other ancillary information can be found throughout this document.
It is important to note that the author of this Annex has chosen to focus solely on the security software
development methodology used for shipping commercial software applications and online services. There are
other processes that cover IT security tasks; the groups that administer these processes are bound by similar
technology and regulatory contexts, but do not create application software intended for broad public use.
While an illustration of both the IT and security software development methodologies might prove interesting
to some readers, it would not necessarily provide more compelling evidence of the practicality of
ISO/IEC 27034.
Usage of the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) in this illustrative context does not constitute endorsement
of the SDL by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

A.2

About the Security Development Lifecycle

The Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a software security assurance process. As a company-wide
initiative and a mandatory policy since 2004, the SDL has played a critical role in embedding security and
privacy in software and culture of the adopting company. Combining a holistic and practical approach, the
SDL introduces security and privacy throughout all phases of the development process. References to
proprietary technologies and resources have been omitted from this Annex.

A.4

Business Context

8.1.2.1 The business context lists and documents all standards and best practices adopted by the
organization that could impact application projects.
The business context includes:
a) project management, development, risk analysis, operational, audit and control processes;
b) the organization’s security policy;
c) practices for the business domain;
d) the development methodology used by the organization;
e) best practices for all programming languages employed by the organization and listed in the
technological context;
f)

the organization’s formal project management process; and

g) the adoption of other relevant ISO/IEC International Standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001,
ISO/IEC 27002, and ISO/IEC 15288.
Business context is set by a combination of corporate-wide policies, region-specific policies, technical context
and market drivers of the individual business units within the corporation.
Security and privacy in software product development is mandated company-wide per the Security
Development Lifecycle (SDL) i The SDL also requires determination of people (security and privacy leads),
processes and controls to be used to track progress against security and privacy goals.ii
Given the broad spectrum of deployment scenarios and development platforms, mandatory adherence to a
fixed set of development methodologies or tools is not feasible. Therefore, business groups are permitted to
address technical challenges that are not directly covered by SDL policy (e.g. compiler and tool mandates on
different platforms) in consultation with security subject matter experts (outlined in greater detail in the Roles,
Responsibilities and Qualifications section below).

A.5 Regulatory Context
8.1.2.2 The regulatory context lists and documents any law or regulation, in any of the organization’s
business locations, that could impact application projects. It includes laws, rules and regulations of the
countries or jurisdictions where the application is developed and/or deployed and/or used.
An organization deploying and/or using the same application in more than one country might have to meet
different security requirements for each country.

Regulatory compliance and geopolitical analysis are covered by existing business processes and are
proactively used to inform the design and development efforts of project teams. Policies are analyzed by the
business units and Legal and Corporate Affairs to insure that all aspects of software creation and release
meet any known legal or regulatory criteria in place in different regions of the world and that any new projects
operate within the bounds of existing policy mandates.
Line of applications (in combination with the reviews mentioned above) are used by the product teams to
automate the process of ensuring regulatory compliance for software applications developed for public
release.
Finally, the output of regulatory and geopolitical reviews are archived with the outputs created by the
Application Security Verification Process (discussed below) to create an objective and comprehensive
representation of the application security development process. However, it is important to note that regulatory
and geopolitical policies are not addressed by the Security Development Lifecycle.

A.6 Application Specifications Repository
8.1.2.3 The application specifications repository lists and documents the organization’s general IT functional
requirements and corresponding pre-approved solutions. Application specifications should include:
a) specifications about how applications should compute, store and transfer information;
b) usual application parameters, functionalities, services and requirements; and
c) source code, binary code, libraries and products or services used or relied upon by applications;
Additional specifications might include those detailing how the application interacts with:
a) other systems;
b) the runtime infrastructure upon which it depends; and
c) the list of controls within the runtime environment.

Specifications are authored and stored by individual business units and generally consist of both functional
guidance (outlining how a particular component should compute, store and transfer information) and technical
guidance (specifying programming languages, compilers, libraries, etc.). In certain cases, the SDL sets policy
for components or other technologies that have a security context (e.g. libraries for cryptographic services) to
ensure that application security and privacy are not compromised by functionality requirements or
convenience.

A.7 Technological Context
8.1.2.4 The technological context comprises the inventory of all IT products, services and technologies
available to the organization for application projects. These products, services and technologies determine
the threats to which applications are exposed.
The technological context includes computers, tools, IT products and services, communication infrastructure
and other technical devices.
EXAMPLE
Technological contexts that might have an impact on application security include client-server infrastructure, web
infrastructure, network infrastructure and development environment and tools.

Technological context is often different across business units, and is derived from a combination of market
drivers, interoperability and compatibility scenarios and technical standards for a particular group. Given the
variation in standards for IT products, services and technologies across business units, the technological
context is set independently by each business unit to allow them to meet their needs. However, business units
should also ensure that software projects are using IT services and technologies that allow them to meet the
security and privacy criteria set by both business and regulatory contexts.

A.8 Roles, Responsibilities and Qualifications
8.1.2.5 The ONF should contain:
a) lists and descriptions of all roles, responsibilities and required professional qualifications for actors
involved in creating and maintaining the ONF and/or roles for creating and maintaining ASCs; and
b) lists and descriptions all roles, responsibilities and required professional qualifications for actors
involved in the organization’s application life cycle, such as information security managers, project
managers, administrators, software acquirers, software development managers, application owners,
user managers, architects, analysts, programmers, testers, system administrators, database
administrators, network administrators and technical personnel.
This is an organization-wide policy that will help ensure that all critical roles for all processes are filled, that
all responsibilities are defined, that conflicts of interest are avoided, and that people filling the roles have
sufficient professional qualifications.

Personnel job categories are created and maintained by Human Resources, with input from the business
units. These categories include high level descriptions of the tasks and competencies unique to each job role.
While Human Resources maintains common job descriptions, it is generally up to the business units to decide
how to specifically specify job categories with respect to security and privacy competence and to use those
criteria to help with delegation of security oversight responsibility within a development team.
The SDL has general criteria and job descriptions for security and privacy roles; these roles are assigned
during the Requirements Phase of the SDL process.iii These specific job roles should be defined prior to the
start of the development stage. These roles are consultative in nature, and provide the framework necessary
to identify, catalog and mitigate security and privacy issues present in a software development project. These
roles include:
Supervisory Roles: These roles are designed to provide project oversight and may include both qualitative
and quantitative advice to project teams as to minimal acceptable security and privacy assurance thresholds
for a software project. The supervisory roles should also be vested with the authority to accept or reject
security and privacy plans from a project team.
a) Security Advisor: This role is filled by an individual security subject matter expert from outside the
project team. The role can either be filled by a qualified member of an independent, centralized
security group within the organization or, by seeking the services of an expert external to the
organization. The person chosen for this task should fill two sub-roles:
i. Auditor: This individual should monitor each phase of the security development process and
attest to successful completion of each stage requirement. The security advisor should have the
freedom to attest to compliance (or non-compliance) with security requirements without
interference from the project team.
ii. Expert: The person chosen for the security advisor role should possess verifiable subject matter
expertise in security.
b) Privacy Advisor: This role is filled by an individual privacy subject matter expert from outside the
project team. The role can either be filled by a qualified member of an independent, centralized
privacy group within the organization or, by seeking the services of an expert external to the
organization. The person chosen for this task should fill two sub-roles:
i. Auditor: This individual should monitor each phase of the privacy development process and
attest to successful completion of each stage requirement. The privacy advisor should have the
freedom to attest to compliance (or non-compliance) with privacy requirements without
interference from the project team.
ii. Expert: The person chosen for the privacy advisor role should possess verifiable subject matter
expertise in privacy.

ISO/IEC 27034-1:2011(E)

Combination of Advisory Roles: The role of security advisor may be combined with the role of privacy
advisor, assuming that an individual with the appropriate skills and experience can be identified.
Team Lead Roles: The team lead roles should be filled by subject matter experts who will represent the
project development team during discussions with the security and privacy advisors. This role is responsible
for the negotiation, acceptance and tracking of minimum security requirements and maintaining clear lines of
communication with advisors and other decision makers during the duration of a software development
project.
a) Security Team Lead(s): This individual (or group of individuals) does not have sole responsibility for
ensuring that a software release has addressed all security issues – however he or she is responsible
for coordinating and tracking security issues for the project. This role also is responsible for status
reporting to the security advisor and to other relevant parties (e.g. development and test leads) on the
project team.
b) Privacy Team Lead(s): This individual (or group of individuals) does not have sole responsibility for
ensuring that a software release has addressed all privacy issues – however he or she is responsible
for coordinating and tracking privacy issues for the project. This role also is responsible for status
reporting to the privacy advisor and to other relevant parties (e.g. development and test leads) on the
project team.

A.9 Organization ASC Library
8.1.2.6 The organization should define at least one library of controls for application security. This library is
called an Application Security Control Library (ASC Library). It lists and documents all ASCs recognized by
the organization. These ASCs evolved from standards, best practices and roles, responsibilities, and
professional qualifications, technological, business, and regulatory contexts and application specifications.

Seventeen ASCs have been identified as part of the SDL process illustrated below; this example includes both
mandatory and optional tasks. ASCs that are not mandatory may be added as necessary by business units to
achieve desired security and privacy targets. The ASCs are outlined below; they are presented in the order
that they occur - using the traditional waterfall development metaphor. In the interest of brevity, full
discussions of each ASC are omitted.
The leftmost ASC below can be considered a “root” ASC – in essence the “parent node” of increasingly
detailed ASC trees as shown in the figure. This hypothetical illustration shows that ASCs could be applied by
an organization with increasing levels of complexity and detail in order to meet the Targeted Level of Trust for
an application, which the organization chose prior to the start of the application project.

Figure A.3 – Example of an ASC tree

A.9.1 Training
1. Training Requirements: All members of software development teams should receive appropriate
training to stay informed about security basics and recent trends in security and privacy. Individuals in
technical job roles (developers, testers, and program managers) that are directly involved with
development of software programs should attend at least one security training class each year. Basic
software security training should cover foundational concepts such as secure design, threat modeling,
attack surface measurement, secure coding, security testing and privacy.iv

A.9.2 Requirements
2. Security Requirements: The need to consider security and privacy at a foundational level is a
fundamental aspect of system development. The optimal point to stipulate trustworthiness
requirements for a software project is during the initial planning stages of a new release. This allows
development teams to identify key milestones and deliverables and permits the integration of security
and privacy in such a way that it minimizes any disruption to plans and schedules. Security and
privacy requirements analysis is performed at project inception and consists of various mandatory
actions, including (at a minimum): determination of SDL applicability; determination of individuals
responsible for security and privacy oversight (see 8.1.2.5 – Roles, responsibilities and qualifications
above); specification of minimum security requirements; and specification and deployment of a
vulnerability/work item tracking system.v
3. Quality Gates/Bug Bars: Quality gates and “bug bars” are used to establish minimum acceptable
levels of security and privacy quality.vi vii Defining these criteria at the start of a project improves
understanding of risks associated with security issues and enables teams to identify and fix security
bugs during development. A project team should negotiate quality gates for each development phase
and have them approved by the security advisor with project-specific clarifications and more stringent
security requirements specified by the security advisor (as appropriate). The project team should also
illustrate compliance with the negotiated quality gates in order to comply with verification requirements
in the Final Security Review. A “bug bar” is a quality gate that applies to the entire software
development project. It is used to define severity boundaries for security bugs (e.g. no known bugs in
the application with a “critical” rating at time of release). The “bug bar” should never be relaxed, even
as a project’s release date nears.
NOTE
The concept of quality gates/bug bars, applied to security, is close to the concept of Targeted Level of Trust, as it is
used to establish minimum acceptable levels of security and privacy.

4. Security and Privacy Risk Assessment: Security and privacy risk assessments (SRAs) are
mandatory processes to identify functional aspects of the software that might require deep review.
Given that program features and intended functionality might be different from project to project, it is
wise to start with simple risk assessments and expand as necessary to meet the project scope. Such
assessments should include the following information:
a) (Security) Which portions of the project will require threat models (see ASC #7 below) before
release?
b) (Security) Which portions of the project will require security design reviews before release?
c) (Security) Which portions of the project (if any) will require penetration testing (pen testing) by
a mutually agreed upon group that is external to the project team? Any portion of the project
that requires penetration testing should resolve issues identified during penetration testing
before it is approved for release.
d) (Security) Any additional testing or analysis requirements the security advisor deems
necessary to mitigate security risks.
e) (Security) Clarification of the specific scope of fuzz testing requirements (see ASC #12
below).
f)

(Privacy) Determination of Privacy Impact Rating:

i. P1 – High Privacy Risk: The feature, product, or service stores or transfers Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) changes settings or file type associations; or installs
software.
ii. P2 – Moderate Privacy Risk: The sole behavior that affects privacy in the feature,
product, or service, is a one-time user-initiated anonymous data transfer (e.g., the
user clicks on a link and goes out to a website).
iii. P3 – Low Privacy Risk: No behaviors exist within the feature, product, or service that
affect privacy. No anonymous or personal data is transferred, no PII is stored on the
machine, no settings are changed on the user's behalf, and no software is installed.

A.9.3 Design
5. Design Requirements: The optimal time to influence a project’s trustworthy design is early in its
lifecycle. It is critically important to consider security and privacy concerns carefully during the design
phase – mitigation of security and privacy issues is much less expensive when performed during the
opening stages of a project lifecycle. Project teams should refrain from the practice of “bolted on”
security and privacy near the end of a project’s development.
In addition, it is crucially important for project teams to understand the distinction between “secure
features” and “security features” – it is quite possible to implement security features, which are in fact,
insecure. Secure features are defined as features whose functionality is well engineered with respect
to security, including rigorous validation of all data before processing, or cryptographically robust
implementation of libraries for cryptographic services. Security features describe program functionality
with security implications (e.g. Kerberos authentication).
Functional design specifications might need to describe security features or privacy features that will
be directly exposed to users, such as requiring user authentication to access specific data or user
consent before use of a high-risk privacy feature. As a result, all design specifications should:
a)
b)
c)

Accurately and completely describe how to implement these features
Describe how to securely implement all functionality enabled by a given feature
Describe how to deploy the feature in a secure fashion.

The design requirements exercise contains a number of required actions, which include, but are not
limited to: security design review, privacy design review and specification, and implementation of
x
minimal cryptographic design requirements.
6. Attack Surface Reduction: Attack surface reduction is closely aligned with threat modeling, although
it addresses security issues from a slightly different perspective. Attack surface reduction is a means
of reducing risk by giving attackers less opportunity to find a weak spot or vulnerability. Attack surface

ISO/IEC 27034-1:2011(E)

reduction embodies employing layered defenses, shutting off or restricting access to system services
and applying the principle of least privilege wherever possible.
7. Threat Modeling: Threat modeling is a mandatory process performed during the design phase that
allows development teams to consider, document and discuss the security implications of designs in a
structured fashion. It also allows for the deliberate consideration of security issues at the component
or application level. Threat modeling is a team exercise encompassing program/project managers,
developers and testers and represents the primary security analysis task performed during the
software design stage.xi

A.9.4 Implementation
8. Use Approved Tools: All development teams should define and publish a list of approved tools (and
specific security functionality such as compiler/linker options, warnings, etc.) to be used on software
projects.xii xiii This list should be reconciled and approved by the security advisor for the project team.
Generally speaking, development teams should strive to use the latest version of approved tools to
take advantage of new security functionality.
9. Deprecate Unsafe Functions: Many commonly used functions and APIs are not secure in the face of
the current threat environment Project teams should analyze all functions and APIs that will be used in
conjunction with a software development project and prohibit those that are determined to be
unsafe.xiv Once the banned list is determined, project teams should use header files, newer compilers
or code scanning tools to check code (including legacy code where appropriate) for the existence of
banned functions and replace them with safer alternatives.
10. Static Analysis: Project teams should perform static code analysis of source code. Static analysis of
source code provides a scalable solution for security code review and can be used to ensure that
secure coding policies set by the security team lead and security advisor are being followed. Static
code analysis by itself is generally insufficient to perform a thorough security review – the security
team and security advisors should be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of static analysis tools
and be prepared to embellish code review tasks with other tools or human review as appropriate.
Lightweight static analysis occurs in the SDL at code check-in time by use of the /analyze function in
Visual Studio.xv Other static analysis tasks are performed as necessary.

A.9.5 Verification
11. Dynamic Program Analysis: Run-time verification of software programs is necessary to ensure that
a software program’s functionality works as designed. This verification task should specify tools that
monitor application behavior for memory corruption, user privilege issues and other critical security
issues. The SDL process uses run-time tools such as AppVerifier with other techniques such as fuzz
testing to achieve desired levels of security test coverage.xvi
12. Fuzz Testing: Fuzz testing is used to induce program failure by deliberately introducing malformed or
random data to the inputs of an application. The SDL specifies that fuzz testing be performed on a
variety of program interfaces. The fuzz tests performed are derived from the intended use of the
application and the functional and technical specifications for the application. The security advisor
may require additional fuzz tests or increases in the scope and duration of the testing based on the
intended behaviour of the application.xvii
13. Threat Model / Attack Surface Review: It is common for an application to deviate significantly from
the functional and technical specifications created during the requirements and design phases of a
software development project. Therefore it is critical to re-review threat models and attack surface
measurement of a given application when it is “code complete.” This review will ensure that any
changes to the system have been accounted for and that any new attack vectors have been reviewed
and mitigated.
14. Manual Code Review (Optional): Manual code review is an optional task in the SDL. Manual code
review is usually performed by the application security team at the recommendation of the security
advisor. While analysis tools can do much of the work of finding and flagging vulnerabilities, they are
not perfect; as a result, manual code review is usually focused on the “critical” components of an
application. Most often it is used where sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII)
is involved. It is also used to examine other critical components such as crypto implementations.

A.9.6 Release
15. Incident Response Plan: Every software release subject to the requirements of the SDL should
include an incident response plan.xviii Even programs with no known vulnerabilities at the time of
release can be subject to new threats that emerge over time. The incident response plan should
include the following at a minimum;
a) An identified sustaining engineering (SE) team, or if the team is too small to have SE resources,
an Emergency Response Plan that identifies three to five engineering staff, three to five marketing
and customer communications staff and at least two management staff to act as points of first
contact in a security emergency.
b) 24 X 7 X 365 on call contacts with decision-making authority.
c) Security servicing plans for code inherited from other groups within the organization.
d) Security servicing plans for licensed third party code – this includes filenames, versions, source
code, 3rd party contact information and contractual permission to make changes (if appropriate).
16. Final Security Review: The Final Security Review (FSR) is a deliberate examination of all the
security activities performed on a software application prior to release. The FSR is performed by the
security advisor with assistance from the regular development staff and the security and privacy team
leads. The FSR is not a “penetrate and patch” exercise, nor is it a chance to perform security activities
that were previously ignored or forgotten. The FSR usually includes an examination of threat models,
exception requests, tool output and performance against the previously determined quality gates or
bug bars.xix The FSR will result in one of three different outcomes:
a) Passed FSR – all security and privacy issues identified by the FSR process are fixed or mitigated.
b) Passed FSR with exceptions – all security and privacy issues identified by the FSR process are
fixed; those that cannot be addressed (e.g. vulnerabilities posed by design level issues) are
logged and corrected in the next release.
c) FSR with escalation – If a team does not meet all SDL requirements and the security advisor
and the product team cannot reach an acceptable (or tolerable) compromise, the security advisor
cannot approve the project, and the project cannot be released. Teams should either address
whatever SDL requirements that they can prior to launch, or escalate to executive management
for a decision.
NOTE
The result of the FSR is close to the concept of Actual Level of Trust, as the FSR is a deliberate examination
of all the security activities performed on a software application prior to release.

17. Release / Archive: Software release to manufacturing (RTM) or to the Web (RTW) is conditional on
completion of the SDL process. The security advisor assigned to the release should certify that the
project team has satisfied security requirements. Similarly, for all products that have at least one
component with a privacy impact rating of P1, the project’s privacy advisor should certify that the
project team has satisfied the privacy requirements before the software can be shipped.
In addition, all pertinent information and data should be archived to allow for post-release servicing of
the software; this includes all specifications, source code, binaries, symbols, threat models,
emergency response plans and any other data necessary to perform post-release servicing tasks.

A.10 Application Security Audit
8.5.1 The purpose of this fifth ASMP step is to verify and formally record the supporting evidence of whether
or not a specific application has attained and is maintaining the application's Targeted Level of Trust.
This step of the ASMP can be performed at any time during the application’s life cycle. Depending on the
application's Targeted Level of Trust, this step can be one-off, periodic or event-driven.
EXAMPLE 1
An organization could periodically perform this step to monitor the status of security implementation during the
realization stage of an application.
EXAMPLE 2
An organization could perform this step to demonstrate an application's Actual Level of Trust before it can be approved
for deployment.
EXAMPLE 3
An organization could perform this step during the operation stages of an application's life cycle as part of the
organization’s annual security audit.

In this step, an internal or external verification team (depending on organizational policies contained in the
ONF) verifies that all verification measurements provided by all the ASCs in the ANF for the specific
application have been performed and that the results were verified. The purpose of this step is to
demonstrate the application's Actual Level of Trust at a specific time. An organization can declare an
application “secure” when its Actual Level of Trust is equal to its Targeted Level of Trust.

The process of auditing application security to measure the Actual Level of Trust involves a number of
different actors and processes in the SDL:


A specially designed line of business application is used to track compliance with the SDL – tool log
uploads, threat models and other automated and manual attestations are centrally stored.



The security and privacy team leads are responsible for ensuring that the data necessary for an
objective judgment is categorized and entered into the tracking application.



This information entered into the tracking application is then used by the security and privacy advisors
to provide the framework for the Final Security Review (outlined above).



The security and privacy advisors are then responsible for reviewing the data entered into the tracking
application (including the FSR results and other additional security tasks assigned by the advisor(s))
and certifying that all requirements are met and/or all exceptions are resolved.

A screen capture of the line of application used to track and verify security tasks is shown in Figure A.4.

A.11 Application Life Cycle Model
8.1.2.7.1 An organization whose business involves developing, outsourcing or acquiring applications
habitually uses a framework of defined processes and activities organized into stages. This framework is
commonly named “life cycle model”. Depending on the context, it is referred to as either “application life
cycle model”, “system life cycle model” or “software life cycle model”.
Such a model is usually unique and customized for a particular organization. It has often been in use for
quite some time and has been refined over the years. It is not a new concept brought by this International
Standard.
A specific application’s life cycle, i.e. the evolution of the application from conception through retirement, is
usually an instantiation of the organization’s life cycle model.
Sometimes, different groups within a complex organization use different application life cycle models for
different application projects. This is often the case in large organizations which are formed through mergers
or which are decentralized. Other organizations have developed different specialized application life cycle
models related to specific application contexts such as web applications, real-time applications, embedded
applications, medical applications, etc.

In this case study, the application life cycle model used for mapping security activities is the SDL. The
previous sections of this document outline the technical, business and regulatory contexts and the roles that
serve in each of those areas.
A simple illustration of the SDL process can be found in Figure A.5. This diagram is a visualization of the
Application Security Controls used on a hypothetical project; from the training of employees to application
release. This is not an exhaustive diagram – as noted previously, many teams add other security and privacy
tasks that are specific to their projects.

Annex B
(informative)
Mapping ASC with an existing standard

Case Study: mapping security controls as described in NIST SP 800-53
Rev. 3 with ASCs as described in ISO/IEC 27034
The purpose of this annex is to illustrate how security controls from an existing source such as
NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 3 can be integrated as ASCs for use in accordance with ISO/IEC 27034.

B.1 ASC candidate categories
This subclause tries to address the possible aspects of the ASC candidate categories as directly cited from
SP 800-53 Rev. 3.
The organization can define ASC categories related to application security, such as:

B.1.1 Common security control-related considerations
Security controls designated by the organization as common controls are, in most cases, managed
by an organizational entity other than the information system owner. Organizational decisions on
which security controls are viewed as common controls can greatly affect the responsibilities of
individual information system owners with regard to the implementation of controls in a particular
baseline. Every control in a baseline should be fully addressed either by the organization or the
information system owner.
B.1.2 Operational/environmental-related considerations
Security controls that are dependent on the nature of the operating environment are applicable only
if the information system is employed in an environment necessitating the controls. For example,
certain physical security controls might not be applicable to space-based information systems, and
temperature and humidity controls might not be applicable to remote sensors that exist outside of
the indoor facilities that contain information systems.
B.1.3 Physical Infrastructure-related considerations
Security controls that refer to organizational facilities (e.g., physical controls such as locks and
guards, environmental controls for temperature, humidity, lighting, fire, and power) are applicable
only to those sections of the facilities that directly provide protection to, support for, or are related to
the information system (including its information technology assets such as electronic mail or web
servers, server farms, data centers, networking nodes, boundary protection devices, and
communications equipment).
B.1.4 Public access-related considerations
Security controls associated with public access information systems should be carefully considered
and applied with discretion since some security controls from the specified control baselines (e.g.,
identification and authentication, personnel security controls) might not be applicable to users
accessing information systems through public interfaces. For example, while the baseline controls
require identification and authentication of organizational personnel that maintain and support
information systems providing the public access services, the same controls might not be required
for access to those information systems through public interfaces to obtain publicly available
information. On the other hand, identification and authentication would be required for users

ISO/IEC 27034-1:2011(E)

accessing information systems through public interfaces in some instances, for example, to
access/change their personal information.
B.1.5 Technology-related considerations
Security controls that refer to specific technologies (e.g., wireless, cryptography, public key
infrastructure) are applicable only if those technologies are employed or are required to be
employed within the information system.
Security controls are applicable only to the components of the information system that provide or
support the security capability addressed by the control and are sources of potential risk being
mitigated by the control.39 For example, when information system components are single-user, not
networked, or only locally networked, one or more of these characteristics might provide appropriate
rationale for not applying selected controls to that component.
Security controls that can be either explicitly or implicitly supported by automated mechanisms, do
not require the development of such mechanisms if the mechanisms do not already exist or are not
readily available in commercial or government off-the-shelf products. In situations where automated
mechanisms are not readily available, cost-effective, or technically feasible, compensating security
controls, implemented through nonautomated mechanisms or procedures, should be used to satisfy
specified security controls or control enhancements (see terms and conditions for applying
compensating controls below).
B.1.6 Policy/regulatory-related considerations
Security controls that address matters governed by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, standards, or regulations (e.g., privacy impact assessments) are required only if the
employment of those controls is consistent with the types of information and information systems
covered by the applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, or regulations.
B.1.7 Scalability-related considerations
Security controls are scalable with regard to the extent and rigor of the control implementation.
Scalability is guided by the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information system being
protected. For example, a contingency plan for a FIPS 199 high-impact information system can be
quite lengthy and contain a significant amount of implementation detail. In contrast, a contingency
plan for a FIPS 199 low-impact information system can be considerably shorter and contain much
less implementation detail. Organizations should use discretion in applying the security controls to
information systems, giving consideration to the scalability factors in particular environments. This
approach facilitates a cost-effective, risk-based approach to security control implementation that
expends no more resources than necessary, yet achieves sufficient risk mitigation and adequate
security.
B.1.8 Security objective-related considerations
Security controls that uniquely support the confidentiality, integrity, or availability security objectives
can be downgraded to the corresponding control in a lower baseline (or appropriately modified or
eliminated if not defined in a lower baseline) if, and only if, the downgrading action: (i) is consistent
with the FIPS 199 security categorization for the corresponding security objectives of confidentiality,
integrity, or availability before moving to the high water mark;40 (ii) is supported by an organizational
assessment of risk; and (iii) does not affect the security-relevant information within the information
system.41 The following security controls are recommended candidates for downgrading: (i)
confidentiality [AC-15, MA-3 (3), MP-2 (1), MP-3, MP-4, MP-5 (1) (2) (3), MP-6, PE-5, SC-4, SC-9];
(ii) integrity [SC-8]; and (iii) availability [CP-2, CP-3, CP-4, CP-6, CP-7, CP-8, MA-6, PE-9, PE-10,
PE-11, PE-13, PE-15, SC-6].42

B.4 Detailed access control classes
This section shows three families of Access Control classes, AC-1, AC-2, AC-17, and AT-1 as directly cited
from SP800-53.
FAMILY: ACCESS CONTROL CLASS: TECHNICAL

B.4.1 AC-1 Access control policy and procedures
Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates:
(1) A formal, documented, access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
compliance; and
(2) Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and
associated access controls.
Supplemental Guidance: The access control policy and procedures are consistent with applicable laws,
Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The access control policy
can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Access control
procedures can be developed for the security program in general, and for a particular information
system, when required. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies and
procedures.
Priority and Baseline Allocation:
Control Enhancements: None. LOW AC-1

MOD AC-1

HIGH AC-1

B.4.2 AC-2 Account management
Control: The organization manages information system accounts, including:
(1) Identifying account types (i.e., individual, group, and system);
(2) Establishing conditions for group membership;
(3) Identifying authorized users of the information system and specifying access rights/privileges;
(4) Requiring appropriate approvals for requests to establish accounts;
(5) Authorizing, establishing, activating, modifying, disabling, and removing accounts;
(6) Reviewing accounts [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];
(7) Specifically authorizing and monitoring the use of guest/anonymous accounts;
(8) Notifying account managers when information system users are terminated; transferred, or
information system usage or need-to-know/need-to-share changes; and
(9) Granting access to the information system based on: (i) a valid need-to-know or need-to-share
that is determined by assigned official duties and satisfying all personnel security criteria; and (ii)
intended system usage.
Supplemental Guidance: The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification
of access rights/privileges is consistent with the requirements in other security controls in the security
plan. Related controls: AC-1, AC-3, AC-4, AC-5, AC-6, AC-10, AC-13, AC-17, AC-19, AC-20, AU-9,
CM-5, CM-6, MA-3, MA-4, MA-5, SA-7, SI-9, SC-13.

Control Enhancements:
(1) The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of information
system accounts.
(2) The information system automatically terminates temporary and emergency accounts after
[Assignment: organization-defined time period for each type of account].
(3) The information system automatically disables inactive accounts after [Assignment: organizationdefined time period].
(4) The information system automatically audits account creation, modification, disabling, and
termination actions and notifies, as required, appropriate individuals.
(5) The organization reviews currently active information system accounts [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency] to verify that temporary accounts and accounts of terminated or
transferred users have been deactivated in accordance with organizational policy.
(6) The organization prohibits the use of information system account identifiers as the identifiers for
user electronic mail accounts.

LOW AC-2

MOD AC-2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)

HIGH AC-2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)

B.4.3 AC-17 Remote access
Control: The organization:
(1) Documents allowed methods of remote access to the information system;
(2) Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for each allowed remote access
method;
(3) Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to connection; and
(4) Enforces requirements for remote connections to the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or
process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled
network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and
wireless. Virtual Private Network (VPN) when adequately provisioned, may be treated as an
organization-controlled network. With regard to wireless, radiated signals within organizationcontrolled facilities, typically qualify as outside organizational control. Wireless technologies include,
but are not limited to, microwave, satellite, packet radio (UHF/VHF), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Remote
access controls are applicable to information systems other than public web servers or systems
specifically designed for public access. Enforcing access restrictions to the information system
associated with remote connections is accomplished by control AC-3. NIST Special Publication 80077 provides guidance on IPsec-based virtual private networks. NIST Special Publications 800-48 and
800-97 provide guidance on wireless network security. NIST Special Publication 800-94 provides
guidance on wireless intrusion detection and prevention. Related controls: AC-1, AC-3, AC-20, IA-2,
IA-8.
Control Enhancements:
(1) The organization employs automated mechanisms to facilitate the monitoring and control of
remote access methods.
(2) The organization uses cryptography to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access
sessions.
Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based
on the FIPS 199 impact level of the information. Related controls: SC-8, SC-9.
(3) The information system routes all remote accesses through a limited number of managed access
control points.

The following process elements are performed. The application context is established first. Then an
application-level risk assessment is conducted. If this provides sufficient information to effectively determine
the controls required to mitigate the risks for the organization to use this application to a degree acceptable (or
tolerable) to the application owner, then the task is complete and risk treatment follows. If the information is
insufficient, another iteration of the risk assessment with revised risk criteria and application environment (e.g.
business, regulatory and technological contexts, application specifications, risk evaluation criteria, risk
acceptance criteria, impact criteria, etc.) will be conducted, possibly on limited parts of the total application
scope.
The effectiveness of risk treatment depends on the results of the risk assessment. If the risk and the derived
security requirements for an application are not well identified, the application will not be adequately secured,
because security requirements are needed to identify the application's Targeted Level of Trust (8.2.3). It is
possible that the risk treatment will not immediately lead to an acceptable (or tolerable) residual risk. In that
case, another iteration of the risk assessment with more precise context parameters (e.g. application
specifications, security requirements, level of trust, required ASC, etc.), is performed. If necessary, security
acceptance can be required by a formal internal or external validation.
According to ISO/IEC 27005, risk acceptance is done at the end of the risk management process. Because
security cannot be implemented on an application at the end of its realisation stage, acceptance of application
risk should be done earlier in the ASMP by the application owner. This should be done at the end of the risk
assessment process, when the owner is identifying the Targeted Level of Trust for a specific application.
During the whole application security risk management process it is important that risks, level of trust and
related ASCs are communicated to the appropriate teams. Also, the application owner should ensure risk
monitoring and review during the whole application life cycle.
Awareness by managers and staff of the risks, the nature of the controls in place to mitigate the risks and the
areas of concern to the organization assist in dealing with incidents and unexpected events in the most
effective manner. As defined in ISO/IEC 27005, the detailed results of every activity of the risk management
process and from the two risk decision points should be documented.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the
development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.

Abstract
This publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information
systems and organizations and a process for selecting controls to protect organizational operations
(including mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of threats including hostile cyber attacks, natural
disasters, structural failures, and human errors (both intentional and unintentional). The security
and privacy controls are customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process
that manages information security and privacy risk. The controls address a diverse set of security
and privacy requirements across the federal government and critical infrastructure, derived from
legislation, Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and/or mission/business
needs. The publication also describes how to develop specialized sets of controls, or overlays,
tailored for specific types of missions/business functions, technologies, or environments of
operation. Finally, the catalog of security controls addresses security from both a functionality
perspective (the strength of security functions and mechanisms provided) and an assurance
perspective (the measures of confidence in the implemented security capability). Addressing both
security functionality and security assurance ensures that information technology products and
the information systems built from those products using sound systems and security engineering
principles are sufficiently trustworthy.

FIPS 200 AND SP 800-53
IMPLEMENTING INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES

FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information
Systems, is a mandatory federal standard developed by NIST in response to FISMA. To comply
with the federal standard, organizations first determine the security category of their information
system in accordance with FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal
Information and Information Systems, derive the information system impact level from the security
category in accordance with FIPS 200, and then apply the appropriately tailored set of baseline
security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal
Information Systems and Organizations. Organizations have flexibility in applying the baseline
security controls in accordance with the guidance provided in Special Publication 800-53. This
allows organizations to tailor the relevant security control baseline so that it more closely aligns
with their mission and business requirements and environments of operation.
FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53, in combination, ensure that appropriate security
requirements and security controls are applied to all federal information and information systems.
An organizational assessment of risk validates the initial security control selection and determines if
additional controls are needed to protect organizational operations (including mission, functions,
image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. The
resulting set of security controls establishes a level of security due diligence for the organization.

DEVELOPING COMMON INFORMATION SECURITY FOUNDATIONS
COLLABORATION AMONG PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES

In developing standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with other federal
agencies and the private sector to improve information security, avoid unnecessary and costly
duplication of effort, and ensure that its publications are complementary with the standards and
guidelines employed for the protection of national security systems. In addition to a comprehensive
public review and vetting process, NIST is collaborating with the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Committee on National Security
Systems (CNSS) to establish a unified information security framework for the federal government.
A common foundation for information security will provide the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence
sectors of the federal government and their contractors, more cost-effective and consistent ways to
manage information security-related risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation. The unified framework will also provide a strong basis for reciprocal
acceptance of authorization decisions and facilitate information sharing. NIST is also working with
many public and private sector entities to establish mappings and relationships between the security
standards and guidelines developed by NIST and the International Organization for Standardization
and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC).

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST

The term security requirement is used by different communities and groups in different ways and
may require additional explanation to establish the particular context for the various use cases.
Security requirements can be stated at a very high level of abstraction, for example, in legislation,
Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, and mission/business needs statements. FISMA
and FIPS Publication 200 articulate security requirements at such a level.
Acquisition personnel develop security requirements for contracting purposes that address the
protections necessary to achieve mission/business needs. Systems/security engineers, system
developers, and systems integrators develop the security design requirements for the information
system, develop the system security architecture and the architecture-specific derived security
requirements, and subsequently implement specific security functions at the hardware, software,
and firmware component level.
Security requirements are also reflected in various nontechnical security controls that address such
matters as policy and procedures at the management and operational elements within organizations,
again at differing levels of detail. It is important to define the context for each use of the term
security requirement so the respective communities (including individuals responsible for policy,
architecture, acquisition, engineering, and mission/business protection) can clearly communicate
their intent.
Organizations may define certain security capabilities needed to satisfy security requirements and
provide appropriate mission and business protection. Security capabilities are typically defined by
bringing together a specific set of safeguards/countermeasures (i.e., security controls) derived from
the appropriately tailored baselines that together produce the needed capability.

TECHNOLOGY AND POLICY NEUTRALITY
CHARACTERISTICS OF SECURITY CONTROLS

The security controls in the catalog with few exceptions, have been designed to be policy- and
technology-neutral. This means that security controls and control enhancements focus on the
fundamental safeguards and countermeasures necessary to protect information during processing,
while in storage, and during transmission. Therefore, it is beyond the scope of this publication to
provide guidance on the application of security controls to specific technologies, environments of
operation, communities of interest, or missions/business functions. Application-specific areas are
addressed by the use of the tailoring process described in Chapter Three and the use of overlays
described in Appendix I. It should also be noted that while the security controls are largely policyand technology-neutral, that does not imply that the controls are policy- and technology-unaware.
Understanding policy and technology is necessary so that the controls are meaningful and relevant
when implemented.
In the few cases where specific technologies are called out in security controls (e.g., mobile, PKI,
wireless, VOIP), organizations are cautioned that the need to provide adequate security goes well
beyond the requirements in a single control associated with a particular technology. Many of the
needed safeguards and countermeasures are obtained from the other security controls in the catalog
allocated to the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security plans and
overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some overlap in the protections articulated
by the security controls within the different control families.
In addition to the customer-driven development of specialized security plans and overlays, NIST
Special Publications and Interagency Reports may provide guidance on recommended security
controls for specific technologies and sector-specific applications (e.g., Smart Grid, healthcare,
Industrial Control Systems, and mobile).
Employing a technology- and policy-neutral security control catalog has the following benefits:
• It encourages organizations to focus on the security capabilities required for mission/business
success and the protection of information, irrespective of the information technologies that are
employed in organizational information systems.
• It encourages organizations to analyze each security control for its applicability to specific
technologies, environments of operation, missions/business functions, and communities of interest.
• It encourages organizations to specify security policies as part of the tailoring process for security
controls that have variable parameters.
The specialization of security plans using the tailoring guidance and overlays, together with a robust
set of technology- and policy-neutral security controls, promotes cost-effective, risk-based
information security for organizations—in any sector, for any technology, and in any operating
environment.

INFORMATION SECURITY DUE DILIGENCE
MANAGING THE RISK TO ORGANIZATIONAL MISSIONS/BUSINESS FUNCTIONS

The security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 are designed to facilitate compliance with
applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
Compliance is not about adhering to static checklists or generating unnecessary FISMA reporting
paperwork. Rather, compliance necessitates organizations executing due diligence with regard to
information security and risk management. Information security due diligence includes using all
appropriate information as part of an organization-wide risk management program to effectively
use the tailoring guidance and inherent flexibility in NIST publications so that the selected security
controls documented in organizational security plans meet the mission and business requirements of
organizations. Using the risk management tools and techniques that are available to organizations is
essential in developing, implementing, and maintaining the safeguards and countermeasures with
the necessary and sufficient strength of mechanism to address the current threats to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Employing effective riskbased processes, procedures, and technologies will help ensure that all federal information systems
and organizations have the necessary resilience to support ongoing federal responsibilities, critical
infrastructure applications, and continuity of government.

PRIVACY CONTROLS
PROVIDING PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION

Appendix J, Privacy Control Catalog, is a new addition to NIST Special Publication 800-53. It is
intended to address the privacy needs of federal agencies. The Privacy Appendix:
•

Provides a structured set of privacy controls, based on best practices, that help organizations
comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, instructions, regulations,
policies, standards, guidance, and organization-specific issuances;

•

Establishes a linkage and relationship between privacy and security controls for purposes of
enforcing respective privacy and security requirements which may overlap in concept and in
implementation within federal information systems, programs, and organizations;

•

Demonstrates the applicability of the NIST Risk Management Framework in the selection,
implementation, assessment, and ongoing monitoring of privacy controls deployed in federal
information systems, programs, and organizations; and

•

Promotes closer cooperation between privacy and security officials within the federal
government to help achieve the objectives of senior leaders/executives in enforcing the
requirements in federal privacy legislation, policies, regulations, directives, standards, and
guidance.

There is a strong similarity in the structure of the privacy controls in Appendix J and the security
controls in Appendices F and G. For example, the control AR-1 (Governance and Privacy Program)
requires organizations to develop privacy plans that can be implemented at the organizational or
program level. These plans can also be used in conjunction with security plans to provide an
opportunity for organizations to select the appropriate set of security and privacy controls in
accordance with organizational mission/business requirements and the environments in which the
organizations operate. Incorporating the same concepts used in managing information security risk,
helps organizations implement privacy controls in a more cost-effective, risked-based manner while
simultaneously protecting individual privacy and meeting compliance requirements. Standardized
privacy controls provide a more disciplined and structured approach for satisfying federal privacy
requirements and demonstrating compliance to those requirements.

CAUTIONARY NOTE
IMPLEMENTING CHANGES BASED ON REVISIONS TO SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-53

When NIST publishes revisions to Special Publication 800-53, there are four primary types of
changes made to the document: (i) security controls or control enhancements are added to or
withdrawn from Appendices F and G and/or to the low, moderate, and high baselines; (ii)
supplemental guidance is modified; (iii) material in the main chapters or appendices is modified;
and (iv) language is clarified and/or updated throughout the document.
When modifying existing tailored security control baselines at Tier 3 in the risk management
hierarchy (as described in Special Publication 800-39) and updating security controls at any tier as a
result of Special Publication 800-53 revisions, organizations should take a measured, risk-based
approach in accordance with organizational risk tolerance and current risk assessments. Unless
otherwise directed by OMB policy, the following activities are recommended to implement changes
to Special Publication 800-53:
• First, organizations determine if any added security controls/control enhancements are
applicable to organizational information systems or environments of operation following
tailoring guidelines in this publication.
• Next, organizations review changes to the supplemental guidance, guidance in the main chapters
and appendices, and updated/clarified language throughout the publication to determine if
changes apply to any organizational information systems and if any immediate actions are
required.
• Finally, once organizations have determined the entirety of changes necessitated by the
revisions to the publication, the changes are integrated into the established continuous
monitoring process to the greatest extent possible. The implementation of new or modified
security controls to address specific, active threats is always the highest priority for sequencing
and implementing changes. Modifications such as changes to templates or minor language
changes in policy or procedures are generally the lowest priority and are made in conjunction
with established review cycles.

Foreword
NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4, represents the most comprehensive update to the
security controls catalog since its inception in 2005. The publication was developed by NIST, the
Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National Security
Systems as part of the Joint Task Force, an interagency partnership formed in 2009. This update
was motivated principally by the expanding threat space—characterized by the increasing
sophistication of cyber attacks and the operations tempo of adversaries (i.e., the frequency of such
attacks, the professionalism of the attackers, and the persistence of targeting by attackers). Stateof-the-practice security controls and control enhancements have been developed and integrated
into the catalog addressing such areas as: mobile and cloud computing; applications security;
trustworthiness, assurance, and resiliency of information systems; insider threat; supply chain
security; and the advanced persistent threat. In addition, Special Publication 800-53 has been
expanded to include eight new families of privacy controls based on the internationally accepted
Fair Information Practice Principles.
Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4, provides a more holistic approach to information security
and risk management by providing organizations with the breadth and depth of security controls
necessary to fundamentally strengthen their information systems and the environments in which
those systems operate—contributing to systems that are more resilient in the face of cyber attacks
and other threats. This “Build It Right” strategy is coupled with a variety of security controls for
“Continuous Monitoring” to give organizations near real-time information that is essential for
senior leaders making ongoing risk-based decisions affecting their critical missions and business
functions.
To take advantage of the expanded set of security and privacy controls, and to give organizations
greater flexibility and agility in defending their information systems, the concept of overlays was
introduced in this revision. Overlays provide a structured approach to help organizations tailor
security control baselines and develop specialized security plans that can be applied to specific
missions/business functions, environments of operation, and/or technologies. This specialization
approach is important as the number of threat-driven controls and control enhancements in the
catalog increases and organizations develop risk management strategies to address their specific
protection needs within defined risk tolerances.
Finally, there have been several new features added to this revision to facilitate ease of use by
organizations. These include:
•

Assumptions relating to security control baseline development;

•

Expanded, updated, and streamlined tailoring guidance;

•

Additional assignment and selection statement options for security and privacy controls;

•

Descriptive names for security and privacy control enhancements;

•

Consolidated tables for security controls and control enhancements by family with
baseline allocations;

•

Tables for security controls that support development, evaluation, and operational
assurance; and

•

Mapping tables for international security standard ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria).

________________________________________________________________________________________________

The security and privacy controls in Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4, have been designed
to be largely policy/technology-neutral to facilitate flexibility in implementation. The controls are
well positioned to support the integration of information security and privacy into organizational
processes including enterprise architecture, systems engineering, system development life cycle,
and acquisition/procurement. Successful integration of security and privacy controls into ongoing
organizational processes will demonstrate a greater maturity of security and privacy programs and
provide a tighter coupling of security and privacy investments to core organizational missions and
business functions.

CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
THE NEED TO PROTECT INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS

he selection and implementation of security controls for information systems 1 and
organizations are important tasks that can have major implications on the operations 2 and
assets of organizations 3 as well as the welfare of individuals and the Nation. Security
controls are the safeguards/countermeasures prescribed for information systems or organizations
that are designed to: (i) protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information that is
processed, stored, and transmitted by those systems/organizations; and (ii) satisfy a set of defined
security requirements. 4 There are several key questions that should be answered by organizations
when addressing the information security considerations for information systems:

T
•

What security controls are needed to satisfy the security requirements and to adequately
mitigate risk incurred by using information and information systems in the execution of
organizational missions and business functions?

•

Have the security controls been implemented, or is there an implementation plan in place?

•

What is the desired or required level of assurance that the selected security controls, as
implemented, are effective in their application? 5

The answers to these questions are not given in isolation but rather in the context of an effective
risk management process for the organization that identifies, mitigates as deemed necessary, and
monitors on an ongoing basis, risks 6 arising from its information and information systems. NIST
Special Publication 800-39 provides guidance on managing information security risk at three
distinct tiers—the organization level, mission/business process level, and information system
level. The security controls defined in this publication and recommended for use by organizations
to satisfy their information security requirements should be employed as part of a well-defined
risk management process that supports organizational information security programs. 7

1

An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing,
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. Information systems also include specialized
systems such as industrial/process controls systems, telephone switching/private branch exchange (PBX) systems, and
environmental control systems.
2

Organizational operations include mission, functions, image, and reputation.

3

The term organization describes an entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within an organizational structure
(e.g., a federal agency or, as appropriate, any of its operational elements).
4

Security requirements are derived from mission/business needs, laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
policies, instructions, standards, guidance, and/or procedures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
the information being processed, stored, or transmitted by organizational information systems.
5

Security control effectiveness addresses the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information
system in its operational environment or enforcing/mediating established security policies.
6
Information security-related risks are those risks that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of
information or information systems and consider the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
7
The program management controls (Appendix G) complement the security controls for an information system
(Appendix F) by focusing on the organization-wide information security requirements that are independent of any
particular information system and are essential for managing information security programs.

CHAPTER 1

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

It is of paramount importance that responsible officials understand the risks and other factors that
could adversely affect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and
the Nation. 8 These officials must also understand the current status of their security programs and
the security controls planned or in place to protect their information and information systems in
order to make informed judgments and investments that mitigate risks to an acceptable level. The
ultimate objective is to conduct the day-to-day operations of the organization and accomplish the
organization’s stated missions and business functions with what the OMB Circular A-130 defines
as adequate security, or security commensurate with risk resulting from the unauthorized access,
use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information.

1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for selecting and specifying security
controls for organizations and information systems supporting the executive agencies of the
federal government to meet the requirements of FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security
Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems. The guidelines apply to all
components 9 of an information system that process, store, or transmit federal information. The
guidelines have been developed to achieve more secure information systems and effective risk
management within the federal government by:
•

Facilitating a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach for selecting and
specifying security controls for information systems and organizations;

•

Providing a stable, yet flexible catalog of security controls to meet current information
protection needs and the demands of future protection needs based on changing threats,
requirements, and technologies;

•

Providing a recommendation for security controls for information systems categorized in
accordance with FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal
Information and Information Systems;

•

Creating a foundation for the development of assessment methods and procedures for
determining security control effectiveness; and

•

Improving communication among organizations by providing a common lexicon that
supports discussion of risk management concepts.

In addition to the security controls described above, this publication: (i) provides a set of
information security program management (PM) controls that are typically implemented at the
organization level and not directed at individual organizational information systems; (ii)
provides a set of privacy controls based on international standards and best practices that help
organizations enforce privacy requirements derived from federal legislation, directives, policies,
regulations, and standards; and (iii) establishes a linkage and relationship between privacy and
security controls for purposes of enforcing respective privacy and security requirements which
may overlap in concept and in implementation within federal information systems, programs,
and organizations. Standardized privacy controls provide a more disciplined and structured
approach for satisfying federal privacy requirements and demonstrating compliance to those
8

This includes risk to critical infrastructure/key resources described in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7.

9

Information system components include, for example, mainframes, workstations, servers (e.g., database, electronic
mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), input/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, printers), network
components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, process controllers, wireless access points,
network appliances, sensors), operating systems, virtual machines, middleware, and applications.

requirements. Incorporating the same concepts used in managing information security risk,
helps organizations implement privacy controls in a more cost-effective, risked-based manner.
The guidelines in this special publication are applicable to all federal information systems 10
other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C.,
Section 3542. 11 The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective to
complement similar guidelines for national security systems and may be used for such systems
with the approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such
systems. 12 State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations are
encouraged to consider using these guidelines, as appropriate.

1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE
This publication is intended to serve a diverse audience of information system and information
security professionals including:
•

Individuals with information system, security, and/or risk management and oversight
responsibilities (e.g., authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior information
security officers, 13 information system managers, information security managers);

•

Individuals with information system development responsibilities (e.g., program managers,
system designers and developers, information security engineers, systems integrators);

•

Individuals with information security implementation and operational responsibilities (e.g.,
mission/business owners, information system owners, common control providers, information
owners/stewards, system administrators, information system security officers);

•

Individuals with information security assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g.,
auditors, Inspectors General, system evaluators, assessors, independent verifiers/validators,
analysts, information system owners); and

•

Commercial companies producing information technology products and systems, creating
information security-related technologies, or providing information security services.

1.3 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SECURITY CONTROL PUBLICATIONS
To create a technically sound and broadly applicable set of security controls for information
systems and organizations, a variety of sources were considered during the development of this
special publication. The sources included security controls from the defense, audit, financial,
healthcare, industrial/process control, and intelligence communities as well as controls defined by
10
A federal information system is an information system used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an
executive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency.
11
A national security system is any information system (including any telecommunications system) used or operated by
an agency or by a contractor of an agency, or other organization on behalf of an agency: (i) the function, operation, or
use of which involves intelligence activities; involves cryptologic activities related to national security; involves
command and control of military forces; involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or
is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions (excluding a system that is to be used for routine
administrative and business applications, e.g., payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications); or
(ii) is protected at all times by procedures established for information that have been specifically authorized under
criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of national defense
or foreign policy.
12

CNSS Instruction 1253 provides implementing guidance for national security systems.

13

At the agency level, this position is known as the Senior Agency Information Security Officer. Organizations may
also refer to this position as the Senior Information Security Officer or the Chief Information Security Officer.

national and international standards organizations. The objective of NIST Special Publication
800-53 is to provide a set of security controls that can satisfy the breadth and depth of security
requirements 14 levied on organizations, mission/business processes, and information systems and
that is consistent with and complementary to other established information security standards.
The catalog of security controls in Special Publication 800-53 can be effectively used to protect
information and information systems from traditional and advanced persistent threats in varied
operational, environmental, and technical scenarios. The controls can also be used to demonstrate
compliance with a variety of governmental, organizational, or institutional security requirements.
Organizations have the responsibility to select the appropriate security controls, to implement the
controls correctly, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controls in satisfying established
security requirements. 15 The security controls facilitate the development of assessment methods
and procedures that can be used to demonstrate control effectiveness in a consistent/repeatable
manner—thus contributing to the organization’s confidence that security requirements continue to
be satisfied on an ongoing basis. In addition, security controls can be used in developing overlays
for specialized information systems, information technologies, environments of operation, or
communities of interest (see Appendix I).

1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES
Organizations use FIPS Publication 199 to categorize their information and information systems.
Security categorization is accomplished as an organization-wide activity 16 with the involvement
of senior-level organizational personnel including, for example, authorizing officials, chief
information officers, senior information security officers, information owners and/or stewards,
information system owners, and risk executive (function). 17 Information is categorized at Tier 1
(organization level) and at Tier 2 (mission/business process level). In accordance with FIPS
Publication 200, organizations use the security categorization results from Tiers 1 and 2 to
designate organizational information systems at Tier 3 (information system level) as low-impact,
moderate-impact, or high-impact systems. For each organizational information system at Tier 3,
the recommendation for security controls from the baseline controls defined in Appendix D is the
starting point for the security control tailoring process. While the security control selection
process is generally focused on information systems at Tier 3, the process is generally applicable
across all three tiers of risk management.
FIPS Publication 199 security categorization associates information and the operation and use of
information systems with the potential worst-case adverse impact on organizational operations
and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. 18 Organizational assessments of risk,
including the use of specific and credible threat information, vulnerability information, and the
likelihood of such threats exploiting vulnerabilities to cause adverse impacts, guide and inform
14

Security requirements are those requirements levied on an information system that are derived from laws, Executive
Orders, directives, policies, instructions, regulations, standards, guidelines, or organizational (mission) needs to ensure
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted.
15

NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on assessing the effectiveness of security controls.

16

See FIPS Publication 200, Footnote 7.

17

Organizations typically exercise managerial, operational, and financial control over their information systems and the
security provided to those systems, including the authority and capability to implement or require the security controls
deemed necessary to protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
18
Considerations for potential national-level impacts and impacts to other organizations in categorizing organizational
information systems derive from the USA PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPDs).

the tailoring process and the final selection of security controls. 19 The final, agreed-upon set of
security controls addressing specific organizational mission/business needs and tolerance for risk
is documented with appropriate rationale in the security plan for the information system. 20 The
use of security controls from Special Publication 800-53 (including the baseline controls as a
starting point in the control selection process), facilitates a more consistent level of security for
federal information systems and organizations, while simultaneously preserving the flexibility
and agility organizations need to address an increasingly sophisticated and hostile threat space,
specific organizational missions/business functions, rapidly changing technologies, and in some
cases, unique environments of operation.
Achieving adequate information security for organizations, mission/business processes, and
information systems is a multifaceted undertaking that requires:
•

Clearly articulated security requirements and security specifications;

•

Well-designed and well-built information technology products based on state-of-the-practice
hardware, firmware, and software development processes;

•

Sound systems/security engineering principles and practices to effectively integrate
information technology products into organizational information systems;

•

Sound security practices that are well documented and seamlessly integrated into the training
requirements and daily routines of organizational personnel with security responsibilities;

•

Continuous monitoring of organizations and information systems to determine the ongoing
effectiveness of deployed security controls, changes in information systems and environments
of operation, and compliance with legislation, directives, policies, and standards;21 and

•

Information security planning and system development life cycle management. 22

From an engineering viewpoint, information security is just one of many required operational
capabilities for information systems that support organizational mission/business processes—
capabilities that must be funded by organizations throughout the system development life cycle in
order to achieve mission/business success. It is important that organizations realistically assess
the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
arising from mission/business processes and by placing information systems into operation or
continuing operations. Realistic assessment of risk requires an understanding of threats to and
vulnerabilities within organizations and the likelihood and potential adverse impacts of successful
exploitations of such vulnerabilities by those threats. 23 Finally, information security requirements
must be satisfied with the full knowledge and consideration of the risk management strategy of

Risk assessments can be accomplished in a variety of ways depending on the specific needs of organizations. NIST
Special Publication 800-30 provides guidance on the assessment of risk as part of an overall risk management process.

Authorizing officials or designated representatives, by accepting the completed security plans, agree to the set of
security controls proposed to meet the security requirements for organizations (including mission/business processes)

THE FUNDAMENTALS
SECURITY CONTROL STRUCTURE, ORGANIZATION, BASELINES, AND ASSURANCE

T

his chapter presents the fundamental concepts associated with security control selection
and specification including: (i) three-tiered risk management; (ii) the structure of security
controls and the organization of the controls in the control catalog; (iii) security control
baselines; (iv) the identification and use of common security controls; (v) security controls in
external environments; (vi) security control assurance; and (vii) future revisions to the security
controls, the control catalog, and baseline controls.

2.1 MULTITIERED RISK MANAGEMENT
The selection and specification of security controls for an information system is accomplished as
part of an organization-wide information security program for the management of risk—that is,
the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
associated with the operation of information systems. Risk-based approaches to security control
selection and specification consider effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to applicable
federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. To
integrate the risk management process throughout the organization and more effectively address
mission/business concerns, a three-tiered approach is employed that addresses risk at the: (i)
organization level; (ii) mission/business process level; and (iii) information system level. The risk
management process is carried out across the three tiers with the overall objective of continuous
improvement in the organization’s risk-related activities and effective inter-tier and intra-tier
communication among all stakeholders having a shared interest in the mission/business success of
the organization. Figure 1 illustrates the three-tiered approach to risk management.

Tier 1 provides a prioritization of organizational missions/business functions which in turn drives
investment strategies and funding decisions—promoting cost-effective, efficient information
technology solutions consistent with the strategic goals and objectives of the organization and
measures of performance. Tier 2 includes: (i) defining the mission/business processes needed to
support the organizational missions/business functions; (ii) determining the security categories of
the information systems needed to execute the mission/business processes; (iii) incorporating
information security requirements into the mission/business processes; and (iv) establishing an
enterprise architecture (including an embedded information security architecture) to facilitate the
allocation of security controls to organizational information systems and the environments in
which those systems operate. The Risk Management Framework (RMF), depicted in Figure 2, is
the primary means for addressing risk at Tier 3.27 This publication focuses on Step 2 of the RMF,
the security control selection process, in the context of the three tiers in the organizational risk
management hierarchy.

Step 1: Categorize the information system based on a FIPS Publication 199 impact assessment; 28
Step 2: Select an initial set of baseline security controls based on the results of the security
categorization and apply tailoring guidance (including the potential use of overlays);
Step 3: Implement the security controls and document the design, development, and
implementation details for the controls;
Step 4: Assess the security controls to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
security requirements for the system; 29
Step 5: Authorize information system operation based on a determination of risk to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the
operation and use of the information system and the decision that this risk is acceptable; and
Step 6: Monitor the security controls in the information system and environment of operation on
an ongoing basis to determine control effectiveness, changes to the system/environment, and
compliance to legislation, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.

2.2 SECURITY CONTROL STRUCTURE
Security controls described in this publication have a well-defined organization and structure. For
ease of use in the security control selection and specification process, controls are organized into
eighteen families. 30 Each family contains security controls related to the general security topic of
the family. A two-character identifier uniquely identifies security control families, for example,
PS (Personnel Security). Security controls may involve aspects of policy, oversight, supervision,
manual processes, actions by individuals, or automated mechanisms implemented by information
systems/devices. Table 1 lists the security control families and the associated family identifiers in
the security control catalog. 31

Of the eighteen security control families in NIST Special Publication 800-53, seventeen families are described in the
security control catalog in Appendix F, and are closely aligned with the seventeen minimum security requirements for
federal information and information systems in FIPS Publication 200. One additional family (Program Management
[PM] family) provides controls for information security programs required by FISMA. This family, while not
specifically referenced in FIPS Publication 200, provides security controls at the organization level rather than the
information system level. See Appendix G for a description of and implementation guidance for the PM controls.
31

Privacy controls listed in Appendix J, have an organization and structure similar to security controls, including the
use of two-character identifiers for the eight privacy families.

and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

The security control structure consists of the following components: (i) a control section; (ii) a
supplemental guidance section; (iii) a control enhancements section; (iv) a references section;
and (v) a priority and baseline allocation section. The following example from the Auditing and
Accountability family illustrates the structure of a typical security control.
AU-3

CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS
Control: The information system generates audit records containing information that establishes
what type of event occurred, when the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the
event, the outcome of the event, and the identity of any individuals or subjects associated with the
event.

Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of
this control includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process
identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or
flow control rules invoked. Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and
event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the information system after the event occurred).
Related controls: AU-2, AU-8, AU-12, SI-11.

Supplemental Guidance:

Control Enhancements:
(1)

CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS | ADDITIONAL AUDIT INFORMATION

The information system generates audit records containing the following additional information:
[Assignment: organization-defined additional, more detailed information].

Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records
includes, for example, full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities
of group account users. Organizations consider limiting the additional audit information to
only that information explicitly needed for specific audit requirements. This facilitates the use
of audit trails and audit logs by not including information that could potentially be misleading
or could make it more difficult to locate information of interest.
Supplemental Guidance:

(2)

CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS | CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT OF PLANNED AUDIT RECORD CONTENT

The information system provides centralized management and configuration of the content to be
captured in audit records generated by [Assignment: organization-defined information system
components].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires that the content to be captured in
audit records be configured from a central location (necessitating automation). Organizations
coordinate the selection of required audit content to support the centralized management and
configuration capability provided by the information system. Related controls: AU-6, AU-7.

The control section prescribes specific security-related activities or actions to be carried out by
organizations or by information systems. The term information system refers to those functions
that generally involve the implementation of information technology (e.g., hardware, software,
and firmware). Conversely, the term organization refers to activities that are generally processdriven or entity-driven—that is, the security control is generally implemented through human or
procedural-based actions. Security controls that use the term organization may still require some
degree of automation to be fulfilled. Similarly, security controls that use the term information
system may have some elements that are process-driven or entity-driven. Using the terms
organization and/or information system does not preclude the application of security controls at
any of the tiers in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business
process level, information system level), as appropriate.

CHAPTER 2

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

For some security controls in the control catalog, a degree of flexibility is provided by allowing
organizations to define values for certain parameters associated with the controls. This flexibility
is achieved through the use of assignment and selection statements embedded within the security
controls and control enhancements. Assignment and selection statements provide organizations
with the capability to tailor security controls and control enhancements based on: (i) security
requirements to support organizational missions/business functions and operational needs; (ii)
risk assessments and organizational risk tolerance; and (iii) security requirements originating in
federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, or guidelines.32
For example, organizations can specify additional information needed for audit records to support
audit event processing. See the AU-3 (1) example above (i.e., [Assignment: organization-defined
additional, more detailed information]). These assignments may include particular actions to be
taken by information systems in the event of audit failures, the frequency of conducting system
backups, restrictions on password use, or the distribution list for organizational policies and
procedures. 33 Once specified, 34 the organization-defined values for assignment and selection
statements become part of the security control, and the control implementation is assessed against
the completed control statement. Assignment statements offer a high degree of flexibility by
allowing organizations to specify parameter values, without requiring those values to be one of
two or more specific predefined choices. In contrast, selection statements narrow the potential
input values by providing a specific list of items from which organizations must choose. 35
The security control enhancements section provides statements of security capability to: (i) add
functionality/specificity to a control; and/or (ii) increase the strength of a control. In both cases,
control enhancements are used in information systems and environments of operation requiring
greater protection than provided by the base control due to the potential adverse organizational
impacts or when organizations seek additions to the base control functionality/specificity based
on organizational assessments of risk. Security control enhancements are numbered sequentially
within each control so that the enhancements can be easily identified when selected to supplement
the base control. Each security control enhancement has a short subtitle to indicate the intended
security capability provided by the control enhancement. In the AU-3 example, if the first control
enhancement is selected, the control designation becomes AU-3 (1). The numerical designation of
a control enhancement is used only to identify the particular enhancement within the control. The
designation is not indicative of either the strength of the control enhancement or any hierarchical
relationship among the enhancements. Control enhancements are not intended to be selected
independently (i.e., if a control enhancement is selected, then the corresponding base security
control must also be selected). This intent is reflected in the baseline specifications in Appendix
D and in the baseline allocation section under each control in Appendix F.
The supplemental guidance section provides non-prescriptive, additional information for a
specific security control. Organizations can apply the supplemental guidance as appropriate,
32

In general, organization-defined parameters used in assignment and selection statements in the basic security
controls apply also to all control enhancements associated with those controls.
33
Organizations determine whether specific assignment or selection statements are completed at Tier 1 (organization
level), Tier 2 (mission/business process level), Tier 3 (information system level), or a combination thereof.
34

Organizations may choose to define specific values for security control parameters in policies, procedures, or
guidance (which may be applicable to more than one information system) referencing the source documents in the
security plan in lieu of explicitly completing the assignment/selection statements within the control as part of the plan.

35

Security controls are generally designed to be technology- and implementation-independent, and therefore do not
contain specific requirements in these areas. Organizations provide such requirements as deemed necessary in the
security plan for the information system.

when defining, developing, and/or implementing security controls. The supplemental guidance
can provide important considerations for implementing security controls in the context of
operational environments, mission/business requirements, or assessments of risk and can also
explain the purpose or meaning of particular controls. Security control enhancements may also
contain supplemental guidance when the guidance is not applicable to the entire control but
instead focused on a particular control enhancement. The supplemental guidance sections for
security controls and control enhancements may contain a list of related controls. Related
controls: (i) directly impact or support the implementation of a particular security control or
control enhancement; (ii) address a closely related security capability; or (iii) are referenced in
the supplemental guidance. Security control enhancements are by definition related to the base
control. Related controls that are listed in the supplemental guidance for the base controls are not
repeated in the supplemental guidance for the control enhancements. However, there may be
related controls identified for control enhancements that are not listed in the base control.
The security control enhancements section provides statements of security capability to: (i) add
functionality/specificity to a control; and/or (ii) increase the strength of a control. In both cases,
control enhancements are used in information systems and environments of operation requiring
greater protection than provided by the base control due to the potential adverse organizational
impacts or when organizations seek additions to the base control functionality/specificity based
on organizational assessments of risk. Security control enhancements are numbered sequentially
within each control so that the enhancements can be easily identified when selected to supplement
the base control. Each security control enhancement has a short subtitle to indicate the intended
security capability provided by the control enhancement. In the AU-3 example, if the first control
enhancement is selected, the control designation becomes AU-3 (1). The numerical designation of
a control enhancement is used only to identify the particular enhancement within the control. The
designation is not indicative of either the strength of the control enhancement or any hierarchical
relationship among the enhancements. Control enhancements are not intended to be selected
independently (i.e., if a control enhancement is selected, then the corresponding base security
control must also be selected). This intent is reflected in the baseline specifications in Appendix
D and in the baseline allocation section under each control in Appendix F.
The references section includes a list of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines (e.g., OMB Circulars/Memoranda, Homeland
Security Presidential Directives, FIPS Publications, and NIST Special Publications) that are
relevant to a particular security control. 36 The references provide federal legislative and policy
mandates as well as supporting information for the implementation of security controls and
control enhancements. The references section also contains pertinent websites for organizations to
use in obtaining additional information for security control implementation and assessment.
The priority and security control baseline allocation section provides: (i) the recommended
priority codes used for sequencing decisions during security control implementation; and (ii) the
initial allocation of security controls and control enhancements to the baselines. Organizations
can use the priority code designation associated with each security control to assist in making
sequencing decisions for control implementation (i.e., a Priority Code 1 [P1] control has a higher
priority for implementation than a Priority Code 2 [P2] control, a Priority Code 2 [P2] control has
a higher priority for implementation than a Priority Code 3 [P3] control, and a Priority Code 0
[P0] indicates the security control is not selected in any baseline). This recommended sequencing
prioritization helps to ensure that the foundational security controls upon which other controls
36

Publications listed in the references section refer to the most recent versions of the publications. References are
provided to assist organizations in applying the security controls and are not intended to be inclusive or complete.

depend are implemented first, thus enabling organizations to deploy controls in a more structured
and timely manner in accordance with available resources. The implementation of security
controls by sequence priority code does not imply the achievement of any defined level of risk
mitigation until all of the security controls in the security plan have been implemented. The
priority codes are intended only for implementation sequencing, not for making security control
selection decisions.

2.3 SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES
Organizations are required to adequately mitigate the risk arising from use of information and
information systems in the execution of missions and business functions. A significant challenge
for organizations is to determine the most cost-effective, appropriate set of security controls,
which if implemented and determined to be effective, would mitigate risk while complying with
security requirements defined by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, regulations, policies,
directives, or standards (e.g., FISMA, OMB Circular A-130, HSPD-12, FIPS Publication 200).
There is no one correct set of security controls that addresses all organizational security concerns
in all situations. Selecting the most appropriate set of security controls for a specific situation or
information system to adequately mitigate risk is an important task that requires a fundamental
understanding of organizational mission/business priorities, the mission and business functions
the information systems will support, and the environments of operation where the systems will
reside. With that understanding, organizations can demonstrate how to most effectively assure the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information and information systems
in a manner that supports mission/business needs while demonstrating due diligence. Selecting,
implementing, and maintaining an appropriate set of security controls to adequately protect the
information systems employed by organizations requires strong collaboration with system owners
to understand ongoing changes to missions/business functions, environments of operation, and
how the systems are used.
To assist organizations in making the appropriate selection of security controls for information
systems, the concept of baseline controls is introduced. Baseline controls are the starting point for
the security control selection process described in this document and are chosen based on the
security category and associated impact level of information systems determined in accordance
with FIPS Publication 199 and FIPS Publication 200, respectively. 37 Appendix D provides a
listing of baseline security controls. Three sets of baseline security controls have been identified
corresponding to the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information systems using
the high water mark defined in FIPS Publication 200 and used in Section 3.1 of this document to
provide an initial set of security controls for each impact level. 38
Appendix F provides a comprehensive catalog of security controls for information systems and
organizations, arranged by control families. Chapter Three provides additional information on
how to use FIPS Publication 199 security categories and FIPS Publication 200 system impact
levels in applying the tailoring guidance to the baseline security controls to achieve adequate risk
mitigation. Tailoring guidance, described in Section 3.2, helps organizations to customize the
security control baselines selected using the results from organizational assessments of risk.
Baseline tailoring actions include: (i) identifying and designating common controls; (ii) applying
scoping considerations; (iii) selecting compensating controls; (iv) assigning specific values to
37

CNSS Instruction 1253 provides guidance on security control baselines for national security systems.

38

The baseline security controls contained in Appendix D are not necessarily absolutes in that the guidance described
in Section 3.2 provides organizations with the ability to tailor controls in accordance with the terms and conditions
established by their authorizing officials and documented in their respective security plans.

CHAPTER 2

and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

security control parameters; (v) supplementing initial baselines with additional security controls
or control enhancements; and (vi) providing additional information for control implementation.

Implementation Tip
There are security controls and control enhancements that appear in the security control catalog
(Appendix F) that are found in only higher-impact baselines or are not used in any of the baselines.
These additional security controls and control enhancements for information systems are available to
organizations and can be used in tailoring security control baselines to achieve the needed level of
protection in accordance with organizational assessments of risk. The set of security controls in the
security plan must be sufficient to adequately mitigate risks to organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the organizational risk tolerance.

2.4 SECURITY CONTROL DESIGNATIONS
There are three distinct types of designations related to the security controls in Appendix F that
define: (i) the scope of applicability for the control; (ii) the shared nature of the control; and (iii)
the responsibility for control development, implementation, assessment, and authorization. These
designations include common controls, system-specific controls, and hybrid controls.
Common controls are security controls whose implementation results in a security capability that
is inheritable by one or more organizational information systems. Security controls are deemed
inheritable by information systems or information system components when the systems or
components receive protection from the implemented controls but the controls are developed,
implemented, assessed, authorized, and monitored by entities other than those responsible for the
systems or components—entities internal or external to the organizations where the systems or
components reside. Security capabilities provided by common controls can be inherited from
many sources including, for example, organizations, organizational mission/business lines, sites,
enclaves, environments of operation, or other information systems. Many of the controls needed
to protect organizational information systems (e.g., security awareness training, incident response
plans, physical access to facilities, rules of behavior) are excellent candidates for common control
status. In addition, there can also be a variety of technology-based common controls (e.g., Public
Key Infrastructure [PKI], authorized secure standard configurations for clients/servers, access
control systems, boundary protection, cross-domain solutions). By centrally managing and
documenting the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of
common controls, security costs can be amortized across multiple information systems.
The organization assigns responsibility for common controls to appropriate organizational
officials (i.e., common control providers) and coordinates the development, implementation,
assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the controls. 39 The identification of common
controls is most effectively accomplished as an organization-wide exercise with the active
involvement of chief information officers, senior information security officers, the risk executive
(function), authorizing officials, information owners/stewards, information system owners, and
information system security officers. The organization-wide exercise considers the security
categories of the information systems within the organization and the security controls necessary
39
The Chief Information Officer, Senior Information Security Officer, or other designated organizational officials at
the senior leadership level assign responsibility for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and
monitoring of common controls to appropriate entities (either internal or external to the organization).

and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

to adequately mitigate the risks arising from the use of those systems (see baseline security
controls in Section 2.3). 40 Common control identification for the controls that impact multiple
information systems, but not all systems across the organization could benefit from taking a
similar approach. Key stakeholders collaborate to identify opportunities to effectively employ
common controls at the mission/business line, site, or enclave level.

Implementation Tip
The selection of common controls is most effectively accomplished on an organization-wide basis
with the involvement of senior leadership (i.e., mission/business owners, authorizing officials, chief
information officers, senior information security officers, information system owners, information
owners/stewards, risk executives). These individuals have the collective knowledge to understand
organizational priorities, the importance of organizational operations and assets, and the importance
of the information systems that support those operations/assets. The senior leaders are also in the
best position to select the common controls for each security control baseline and assign specific
responsibilities for developing, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring those controls.

When common controls protect multiple organizational information systems of differing impact
levels, the controls are implemented with regard to the highest impact level among the systems. If
the common controls are not implemented at the highest impact level of the information systems,
system owners will need to factor this situation into their assessments of risk and take appropriate
risk mitigation actions (e.g., adding security controls or control enhancements, changing assigned
values of security control parameters, implementing compensating controls, or changing certain
aspects of mission/business processes). Implementing common controls that are less than
effective or that provide insufficient security capability for higher-impact information systems
can have a significant adverse impact on organizational missions or business functions.
Common controls are generally documented in the organization-wide information security
program plan unless implemented as part of a specific information system, in which case the
controls are documented in the security plan for that system. 41 Organizations have the flexibility
to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple documents with references or
pointers, as appropriate. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common
controls are included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the information
security program plan contains multiple documents, organizations specify in each document the
organizational officials responsible for development, implementation, assessment, authorization,
and monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization may require
that the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously
monitor physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls
are not associated with a particular information system but instead, support multiple systems.
When common controls are included in a separate security plan for an information system (e.g.,
security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system providing boundary protection
inherited by one or more organizational information systems), the information security program
plan indicates which separate security plan contains a description of the common controls.
40

Each common control identified by the organization is reviewed for applicability to each specific organizational
information system, typically by information system owners and authorizing officials.
41
Information security program plans are described in Appendix G. Organizations ensure that any security capabilities
provided by common controls (i.e., security capabilities inheritable by other organizational entities) are described in
sufficient detail to facilitate adequate understanding of the control implementation by inheriting entities.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Common controls, whether employed in organizational information systems or environments of
operation, are authorized by senior officials with at least the same level of authority/responsibility
for managing risk as the authorization officials for information systems inheriting the controls.
Authorization results for common controls are shared with the appropriate information system
owners and authorizing officials. A plan of action and milestones is developed and maintained for
common controls that have been determined through independent assessments, to be less than
effective. Information system owners dependent on common controls that are less than effective
consider whether they are willing to accept the associated risk or if additional tailoring is required
to address the weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls. Such risk-based decisions are influenced
by available resources, the trust models employed by the organization, and the risk tolerance of
authorizing officials and the organization.42 Common controls are subject to the same assessment
and monitoring requirements as system-specific controls employed in individual organizational
information systems. Because common controls impact more than one system, a higher degree of
confidence regarding the effectiveness of those controls may be required.
Security controls not designated as common controls are considered system-specific or hybrid
controls. System-specific controls are the primary responsibility of information system owners
and their respective authorizing officials. Organizations assign a hybrid status to security controls
when one part of the control is common and another part of the control is system-specific. For
example, an organization may choose to implement the Incident Response Policy and Procedures
security control (IR-1) as a hybrid control with the policy portion of the control designated as
common and the procedures portion of the control designated as system-specific. Hybrid controls
may also serve as predefined templates for further control refinement. Organizations may choose,
for example, to implement the Contingency Planning security control (CP-2) as a predefined
template for a generalized contingency plan for all organizational information systems with
information system owners tailoring the plan, where appropriate, for system-specific uses.
Partitioning security controls into common, hybrid, and system-specific controls can result in
significant savings to organizations in implementation and assessment costs as well as a more
consistent application of security controls organization-wide. While security control partitioning
into common, hybrid, and system-specific controls is straightforward and intuitive conceptually,
the actual application takes a significant amount of planning and coordination. At the information
system level, determination of common, hybrid, or system-specific security controls follows the
development of a tailored baseline. It is necessary to first determine what security capability is
needed before organizations assign responsibility for how security controls are implemented,
operated, and maintained.
Security plans for individual information systems identify which security controls required for
those systems have been designated by organizations as common controls and which controls
have been designated as system-specific or hybrid controls. Information system owners are
responsible for any system-specific implementation details associated with common controls.
These implementation details are identified and described in the security plans for the individual
information systems. Senior information security officers for organizations coordinate with
common control providers (e.g., facility/site managers, human resources managers, intrusion
detection system owners) to ensure that the required controls are developed, implemented, and
assessed for effectiveness. Collectively, the security plans for individual information systems and
the organization-wide information security program plans provide complete coverage for all
security controls employed within organizations.
42

NIST Special Publication 800-39 provides guidance on trust models, including validated, direct historical, mediated,
and mandated trust models.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

The determination as to whether a security control is a common, hybrid, or system-specific is
context-based. Security controls cannot be determined to be common, hybrid, or system-specific
simply based on reviewing the language of the control. For example, a control may be systemspecific for a particular information system, but at the same time that control could be a common
control for another system, which would inherit the control from the first system. One indicator of
whether a system-specific control may also be a common control for other information systems is
to consider who or what depends on the functionality of that particular control. If a certain part of
an information system or solution external to the system boundary depends on the control, then
that control may be a candidate for common control identification.

Implementation Tip
•

Organizations consider the inherited risk from the use of common controls. Security plans,
security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common controls (or a
summary of such information) are made available to information system owners (for systems
inheriting the controls) after the information is reviewed and approved by the senior official or
executive responsible and accountable for the controls.

•

Organizations ensure that common control providers keep control status information current
since the controls typically support multiple organizational information systems. Security plans,
security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common controls are used
by authorizing officials to make risk-based decisions in the security authorization process for
their information systems and therefore, inherited risk from common controls is a significant
factor in such risk-based decisions.

•

Organizations ensure that common control providers have the capability to rapidly broadcast
changes in the status of common controls that adversely affect the protections being provided by
and expected of the common controls. Common control providers inform system owners when
problems arise in the inherited common controls (e.g., when an assessment or reassessment of
a common control indicates the control is flawed or deficient in some manner, or when a new
threat or attack method arises that renders the common control less than effective in protecting
against the new threat or attack method).

•

Organizations are encouraged to employ automated management systems to maintain records
of the specific common controls employed in each organizational information system to enhance
the ability of common control providers to rapidly communicate with system owners.

•

If common controls are provided to organizations by entities external to the organization (e.g.,
shared and/or external service providers), arrangements are made with the external/shared
service providers by the organization to obtain information on the effectiveness of the deployed
controls. Information obtained from external organizations regarding effectiveness of common
controls is factored into authorization decisions.

2.5 EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS
Organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on information system services provided by
external providers to conduct important missions and business functions. External information
system services are computing and information technology services implemented outside of the
traditional security authorization boundaries established by organizations for their information
systems. Those traditional authorization boundaries linked to physical space and control of assets,
are being extended (both physically and logically) with the growing use of external services. In
this context, external services can be provided by: (i) entities within the organization but outside
of the security authorization boundaries established for organizational information systems; (ii)
entities outside of the organization either in the public sector (e.g., federal agencies) or private

CHAPTER 2

PAGE 17

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

sector (e.g., commercial service providers); or (iii) some combination of the public and private
sector options. External information system services include, for example, the use of serviceoriented architectures (SOAs), cloud-based services (infrastructure, platform, software), or data
center operations. External information system services may be used by, but are typically not part
of, organizational information systems. In some situations, external information system services
may completely replace or heavily augment the routine functionality of internal organizational
information systems.
FISMA and OMB policies require that federal agencies using external service providers to
process, store, or transmit federal information or operate information systems on behalf of the
federal government, assure that such use meets the same security requirements that federal
agencies are required to meet. Security requirements for external service providers including the
security controls for external information systems are expressed in contracts or other formal
agreements. 43 Organizations are responsible and accountable for the information security risk
incurred by the use of information system services provided by external providers. Such risk is
addressed by incorporating the Risk Management Framework (RMF) as part of the terms and
conditions of the contracts with external providers. Organizations can require external providers
to implement all steps in the RMF except the security authorization step, which remains an
inherent federal responsibility directly linked to managing the information security risk related to
the use of external information system services.44 Organizations can also require external
providers to provide appropriate evidence to demonstrate that they have complied with the RMF
in protecting federal information. However, federal agencies take direct responsibility for the
overall security of such services by authorizing the information systems providing the services.
Relationships with external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example,
through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts,
interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, service-level agreements), licensing
agreements, and/or supply chain exchanges. The growing use of external service providers and
new relationships being forged with those providers present new and difficult challenges for
organizations, especially in the area of information system security. These challenges include:
•

Defining the types of external information system services provided to organizations;

•

Describing how those external services are protected in accordance with the information
security requirements of organizations; and

•

Obtaining the necessary assurances that the risk to organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation arising from the use of the external services
is acceptable.

The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level
depends on the trust that organizations place in external service providers. In some cases, the
level of trust is based on the amount of direct control organizations are able to exert on external
service providers with regard to employment of security controls necessary for the protection of
43

Organizations consult the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) when acquiring cloud
services from external providers. FedRAMP addresses required security controls and independent assessments for a
variety of cloud services. Additional information is available at http://www.fedramp.gov.
44
To effectively manage information security risk, organizations authorize information systems of external providers
that are part of the information technologies or services (e.g., infrastructure, platform, or software) provided to the
federal government. Security authorization requirements are expressed in the terms and conditions of contracts with
external providers of those information technologies and services.

CHAPTER 2

PAGE 18

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

the service/information and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those controls. 45
The level of control is usually established by the terms and conditions of the contracts or servicelevel agreements with the external service providers and can range from extensive control (e.g.,
negotiating contracts or agreements that specify detailed security requirements for the providers)
to very limited control (e.g., using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain commodity
services 46 such as commercial telecommunications services). In other cases, levels of trust are
based on factors that convince organizations that required security controls have been employed
and that determinations of control effectiveness exist. For example, separately authorized external
information system services provided to organizations through well-established lines of business
relationships may provide degrees of trust in such services within the tolerable risk range of the
authorizing officials and organizations using the services.
The provision of services by external providers may result in certain services without explicit
agreements between organizations and the providers. Whenever explicit agreements are feasible
and practical (e.g., through contracts, service-level agreements), organizations develop such
agreements and require the use of the security controls in Appendix F of this publication. When
organizations are not in a position to require explicit agreements with external service providers
(e.g., services are imposed on organizations, services are commodity services), organizations
establish and document explicit assumptions about service capabilities with regard to security. In
situations where organizations are procuring information system services through centralized
acquisition vehicles (e.g., governmentwide contracts by the General Services Administration or
other preferred and/or mandatory acquisition organizations), it may be more efficient and costeffective for contract originators to establish and maintain stated levels of trust with external
service providers (including the definition of required security controls and level of assurance
with regard to the provision of such controls). Organizations subsequently acquiring information
system services from centralized contracts can take advantage of the negotiated levels of trust
established by the procurement originators and thus avoid costly repetition of activities necessary
to establish such trust. 47 Centralized acquisition vehicles (e.g., contracts) may also require the
active participation of organizations. For example, organizations may be required by provisions in
contracts or agreements to install public key encryption-enabled client software recommended by
external service providers.
Ultimately, the responsibility for adequately mitigating unacceptable risks arising from the use of
external information system services remains with authorizing officials. Organizations require
that appropriate chains of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with
the many issues associated with information system security. Organizations establish and retain a
level of trust that participating service providers in the potentially complex consumer-provider
45

The level of trust that organizations place in external service providers can vary widely, ranging from those who are
highly trusted (e.g., business partners in a joint venture that share a common business model and common goals) to
those who are less trusted and represent greater sources of risk (e.g., business partners in one endeavor who are also
competitors in another market sector). NIST Special Publication 800-39 describes different trust models that can be
employed by organizations when establishing relationships with external service providers.
46
Commercial providers of commodity-type services typically organize their business models and services around the
concept of shared resources and devices for a broad and diverse customer base. Therefore, unless organizations obtain
fully dedicated services from commercial service providers, there may be a need for greater reliance on compensating
security controls to provide the necessary protections for the information system that relies on those external services.
Organizational assessments of risk and risk mitigation activities reflect this situation.
47

For example, procurement originators could authorize information systems providing external services to the federal
government under the specific terms and conditions of the contracts. Federal agencies requesting such services under
the terms of the contracts would not be required to reauthorize the information systems when acquiring such services
(unless the request included services outside the scope of the original contracts).

CHAPTER 2

and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

relationship provide adequate protection for the services rendered to organizations. The chain of
trust can be complicated due to the number of entities participating in the consumer-provider
relationship and the types of relationships between the parties. External service providers may
also outsource selected services to other external entities, making the chain of trust more difficult
and complicated to manage. Depending on the nature of the services, organizations may find it
impossible to place significant trust in external providers. This situation is due not to any inherent
untrustworthiness on the part of providers, but to the intrinsic level of risk in the services. 48
Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the external services and/or providers,
organizations can: (i) mitigate the risk by employing compensating controls; (ii) accept the risk
within the level of organizational risk tolerance; (iii) transfer risk by obtaining insurance to cover
potential losses; or (iv) avoid risk by choosing not to obtain the services from certain providers
(resulting in performance of missions/business operations with reduced levels of functionality or
possibly no functionality at all). 49 For example, in the case of cloud-based information systems
and/or services, organizations might require as a compensating control, that all information stored
in the cloud be encrypted for added security of the information. Alternatively, organizations may
require encrypting some of the information stored in the cloud (depending on the criticality or
sensitivity of such information)—accepting additional risk but limiting the risk of not storing all
information in an unencrypted form.

2.6 ASSURANCE AND TRUSTWORTHINESS
Assurance and trustworthiness of information systems, system components, and information
system services are becoming an increasingly important part of the risk management strategies
developed by organizations. Whether information systems are deployed to support, for example,
the operations of the national air traffic control system, a major financial institution, a nuclear
power plant providing electricity for a large city, or the military services and warfighters, the
systems must be reliable, trustworthy, and resilient in the face of increasingly sophisticated and
pervasive threats. To understand how organizations achieve trustworthy systems and the role
assurance plays in the trustworthiness factor, it is important to first define the term trust. Trust, in
general, is the belief that an entity will behave in a predictable manner while performing specific
functions, in specific environments, and under specified conditions or circumstances. The entity
may be a person, process, information system, system component, system-of-systems, or any
combination thereof.
From an information security perspective, trust is the belief that a security-relevant entity will
behave in a predictable manner when satisfying a defined set of security requirements under
specified conditions/circumstances and while subjected to disruptions, human errors, component
faults and failures, and purposeful attacks that may occur in the environment of operation. Trust
is usually determined relative to a specific security capability 50 and can be decided relative to an
individual system component or the entire information system. However, trust at the information
system level is not achieved as a result of composing a security capability from a set of trusted
system components—rather, trust at the system level is an inherently subjective determination
that is derived from the complex interactions among entities (i.e., technical components, physical
48

There may also be risk in disallowing certain functionality because of security concerns. Security is merely one of
multiple considerations in an overall risk determination.
49

Alternative providers offering a higher basis for trust, usually at a higher cost, may be available.

50

A security capability is a combination of mutually reinforcing security controls (i.e., safeguards/countermeasures)
implemented by technical means (i.e., functionality in hardware, software, and firmware), physical means (i.e., physical
devices and protective measures), and/or procedural means (i.e., procedures performed by individuals).

CHAPTER 2

PAGE 20

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

components, and individuals), taking into account the life cycle activities that govern, develop,
operate, and sustain the system. In essence, to have trust in a security capability requires that
there is a sufficient basis for trust, or trustworthiness, in the set of security-relevant entities that
are to be composed to provide such capability.

Security Capability
Organizations can consider defining a set of security capabilities as a precursor to the security
control selection process. The concept of security capability is a construct that recognizes that the
protection of information being processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems, seldom
derives from a single safeguard or countermeasure (i.e., security control). In most cases, such
protection results from the selection and implementation of a set of mutually reinforcing security
controls. For example, organizations may wish to define a security capability for secure remote
authentication. This capability can be achieved by the selection and implementation of a set of
security controls from Appendix F (e.g., IA-2 [1], IA-2 [2], IA-2 [8], IA-2 [9], and SC-8 [1]). Moreover,
security capabilities can address a variety of areas that can include, for example, technical means,
physical means, procedural means, or any combination thereof. Thus, in addition to the above
functional capability for secure remote access, organizations may also need security capabilities that
address physical means such as tamper detection on a cryptographic module or anomaly
detection/analysis on an orbiting spacecraft.
As the number of security controls in Appendix F grows over time in response to an increasingly
sophisticated threat space, it is important for organizations to have the ability to describe key security
capabilities needed to protect core organizational missions/business functions, and to subsequently
define a set of security controls that if properly designed, developed, and implemented, produce
such capabilities. This simplifies how the protection problem is viewed conceptually. In essence,
using the construct of security capability provides a shorthand method of grouping security controls
that are employed for a common purpose or to achieve a common objective. This becomes an
important consideration, for example, when assessing security controls for effectiveness.
Traditionally, assessments have been conducted on a control-by-control basis producing results that
are characterized as pass (i.e., control satisfied) or fail (i.e., control not satisfied). However, the
failure of a single control or in some cases, the failure of multiple controls, may not affect the overall
security capability needed by an organization. Moreover, employing the broader construct of security
capability allows an organization to assess the severity of vulnerabilities discovered in its information
systems and determine if the failure of a particular security control (associated with a vulnerability) or
the decision not to deploy a certain control, affects the overall capability needed for mission/business
protection. It also facilitates conducting root cause analyses to determine if the failure of one security
control can be traced to the failure of other controls based on the established relationships among
controls. Ultimately, authorization decisions (i.e., risk acceptance decisions) are made based on the
degree to which the desired security capabilities have been effectively achieved and are meeting the
security requirements defined by an organization. These risk-based decisions are directly related to
organizational risk tolerance that is defined as part of an organization’s risk management strategy.

Trustworthiness with respect to information systems, expresses the degree to which the systems
can be expected to preserve with some degree of confidence, the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the information that is being processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems across
a range of threats. 51 Trustworthy information systems are systems that are believed to be capable
of operating within a defined risk tolerance despite the environmental disruptions, human errors,
structural failures, and purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the environments in which
51

While information is the primary area of concern, trustworthiness applies to the protections for all assets deemed
critical by organizations. Furthermore, protections are provided by technology (i.e., hardware, software, firmware),
physical elements (i.e., doors, locks, surveillance), and human elements (i.e., people, processes, procedures).

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

the systems operate—systems that have the trustworthiness to successfully carry out assigned
missions/business functions under conditions of stress and uncertainty.
Two fundamental components affecting the trustworthiness of information systems are security
functionality and security assurance. Security functionality is typically defined in terms of the
security features, functions, mechanisms, services, procedures, and architectures implemented
within organizational information systems or the environments in which those systems operate.
Security assurance is the measure of confidence that the security functionality is implemented
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
security requirements for the system—thus possessing the capability to accurately mediate and
enforce established security policies. Security controls address both security functionality and
security assurance. Some controls focus primarily on security functionality (e.g., PE-3, Physical
Access Control; IA-2, Identification and Authentication; SC-13, Cryptographic Protection; AC-2,
Account Management). Other controls focus primarily on security assurance (e.g., CA-2, Security
Assessment; SA-17, Developer Security Architecture and Design; CM-3, Configuration Change
Control). Finally, certain security controls can support security functionality and assurance (e.g.,
RA-5, Vulnerability Scanning; SC-3, Security Function Isolation; AC-25, Reference Monitor).
Security controls related to functionality are combined to develop a security capability with the
assurance-related controls implemented to provide a degree of confidence in the capability within
the organizational risk tolerance.

The Compelling Argument for Assurance
Organizations specify assurance-related controls to define activities performed to generate relevant
and credible evidence about the functionality and behavior of organizational information systems and
to trace the evidence to the elements that provide such functionality/behavior. This evidence is used
to obtain a degree of confidence that the systems satisfy stated security requirements—and do so
while effectively supporting the organizational missions/business functions while being subjected to
threats in the intended environments of operation.

Assurance Evidence—From Developmental and Operational Activities
Organizations obtain security assurance by the actions taken by information system developers,
implementers, operators, maintainers, and assessors. Actions by individuals and/or groups during
the development/operation of information systems produce security evidence that contributes to
the assurance, or measures of confidence, in the security functionality needed to deliver the
security capability. The depth and coverage of these actions (as described in Appendix E) also
contribute to the efficacy of the evidence and measures of confidence. The evidence produced by
developers, implementers, operators, assessors, and maintainers during the system development
life cycle (e.g., design/development artifacts, assessment results, warranties, and certificates of
evaluation/validation) contributes to the understanding of the security controls implemented by
organizations.
The strength of security functionality 52 plays an important part in being able to achieve the
needed security capability and subsequently satisfying the security requirements of organizations.
52

The security strength of an information system component (i.e., hardware, software, or firmware) is determined by
the degree to which the security functionality implemented within that component is correct, complete, resistant to
direct attacks (strength of mechanism), and resistant to bypass or tampering.

CHAPTER 2

PAGE 22

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Information system developers can increase the strength of security functionality by employing as
part of the hardware/software/firmware development process: (i) well-defined security policies
and policy models; (ii) structured/rigorous design and development techniques; and (iii) sound
system/security engineering principles. The artifacts generated by these development activities
(e.g., functional specifications, high-level/low-level designs, implementation representations
[source code and hardware schematics], the results from static/dynamic testing and code analysis)
can provide important evidence that the information systems (including the components that
compose those systems) will be more reliable and trustworthy. Security evidence can also be
generated from security testing conducted by independent, accredited, third-party assessment
organizations (e.g., Common Criteria Testing Laboratories, Cryptographic/Security Testing
Laboratories, and other assessment activities by government and private sector organizations53).
In addition to the evidence produced in the development environment, organizations can produce
evidence from the operational environment that contributes to the assurance of functionality and
ultimately, security capability. Operational evidence includes, for example, flaw reports, records
of remediation actions, the results of security incident reporting, and the results of organizational
continuous monitoring activities. Such evidence helps to determine the effectiveness of deployed
security controls, changes to information systems and environments of operation, and compliance
with federal legislation, policies, directives, regulations, and standards. Security evidence,
whether obtained from development or operational activities, provides a better understanding of
security controls implemented and used by organizations. Together, the actions taken during the
system development life cycle by developers, implementers, operators, maintainers, and assessors
and the evidence produced as part of those actions, help organizations to determine the extent to
which the security functionality within their information systems is implemented correctly,
operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting stated security
requirements and enforcing or mediating established security policies—thus providing greater
confidence in the security capability.
With regard to the security evidence produced, the depth and coverage of such evidence can
affect the level of assurance in the functionality implemented. Depth and coverage are attributes
associated with assessment methods and the generation of security evidence. Assessment methods
can be applied to developmental and operational assurance. For developmental assurance, depth
is associated with the rigor, level of detail, and formality of the artifacts produced during the
design and development of the hardware, software, and firmware components of information
systems (e.g., functional specifications, high-level design, low-level design, source code). The
level of detail available in development artifacts can affect the type of testing, evaluation, and
analysis conducted during the system development life cycle (e.g., black-box testing, gray-box
testing, white-box testing, static/dynamic analysis). For operational assurance, the depth attribute
addresses the number and types of assurance-related security controls selected and implemented.
In contrast, the coverage attribute is associated with the assessment methods employed during
development and operations, addressing the scope and breadth of assessment objects included in
the assessments (e.g., number/types of tests conducted on source code, number of software
modules reviewed, number of network nodes/mobile devices scanned for vulnerabilities, number
of individuals interviewed to check basic understanding of contingency responsibilities).54
53

For example, third-party assessment organizations assess cloud services and service providers in support of the
Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). Common Criteria Testing Laboratories test and
evaluate information technology products using ISO/IEC standard 15408. Cryptographic/Security Testing Laboratories
test cryptographic modules using the FIPS 140-2 standard.
54
NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on the generation of security evidence related to security
assessments conducted during the system development life cycle.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Addressing assurance-related controls during acquisition and system development can help
organizations to obtain sufficiently trustworthy information systems and components that are
more reliable and less likely to fail. These controls include ensuring that developers employ
sound systems security engineering principles and processes including, for example, providing a
comprehensive security architecture, and enforcing strict configuration management and control
of information system and software changes. Once information systems are deployed, assurancerelated controls can help organizations to continue to have confidence in the trustworthiness of
the systems. These controls include, for example, conducting integrity checks on software and
firmware components, conducting penetration testing to find vulnerabilities in organizational
information systems, monitoring established secure configuration settings, and developing
policies/procedures that support the operation and use of the systems.
The concepts described above, including security requirements, security capability, security
controls, security functionality, and security assurance, are brought together in a model for
trustworthiness for information systems and system components. Figure 3 illustrates the key
components in the model and the relationship among the components.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Developmental and Operational Activities to Achieve High Assurance
Raising the bar on assurance can be difficult and costly for organizations—but sometimes
essential for critical applications, missions, or business functions. Determining what parts of the
organization’s information technology infrastructure demand higher assurance of implemented
security functionality is a Tier 1/Tier 2 risk management activity (see Figure 1 in Chapter Two).
This type of activity occurs when organizations determine the security requirements necessary to
protect organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Determining security requirements and
the associated security capabilities needed to generate the appropriate protection is an integral
part of the organizational risk management process described in NIST Special Publication 80039—specifically, in the development of the risk response strategy following the risk framing and
risk assessment steps (where organizations establish priorities, assumptions, constraints, risk
tolerance and assess threats, vulnerabilities, mission/business impacts, and likelihood of threat
occurrence). After the security requirements and security capabilities are determined at Tiers 1
and 2 (including the necessary assurance requirements to provide measures of confidence in the
desired capabilities), those requirements/capabilities are reflected in the design of the enterprise
architecture, the associated mission/business processes, and the organizational information
systems that are needed to support those processes. Organizations can use the Risk Management
Framework (RMF), described in NIST Special Publication 800-37, to ensure that the appropriate
assurance levels are achieved for the information systems and system components deployed to
carry out core missions and business functions. This is primarily a Tier 3 activity but can have
some overlap with Tiers 1 and 2, for example, in the area of common control selection.
Trustworthy information systems are difficult to build from a software and systems development
perspective. However, there are a number of design, architectural, and implementation principles
that, if used, can result in more trustworthy systems. These core security principles include, for
example, simplicity, modularity, layering, domain isolation, least privilege, least functionality,
and resource isolation/encapsulation. Information technology products and systems exhibiting a
higher degree of trustworthiness (i.e., products/systems having the requisite security functionality
and security assurance) are expected to exhibit a lower rate of latent design/implementation flaws
and a higher degree of penetration resistance against a range of threats including, for example,
sophisticated cyber attacks, natural disasters, accidents, and intentional/unintentional errors.55 The
vulnerability and susceptibility of organizational missions/business functions and supporting
information systems to known threats, the environments of operation where those systems are
deployed, and the maximum acceptable level of information security risk, guide the degree of
trustworthiness needed.
Appendix E describes the minimum assurance requirements for federal information systems and
organizations and highlights the assurance-related controls in the security control baselines in
Appendix D needed to ensure that the requirements are satisfied. 56

55
Organizations also rely to a great extent on security assurance from an operational perspective as illustrated by the
assurance-related controls in Tables E-1 through E-3. Operational assurance is obtained by other than developmental
actions including for example, defining and applying security configuration settings on information technology
products, establishing policies and procedures, assessing security controls, and conducting a rigorous continuous
monitoring program. In some situations, to achieve the necessary security capability with weak or deficient information
technology, organizations compensate by increasing their operational assurance.
56
CNSS Instruction 1253 designates security control baselines for national security systems. Therefore, the assurancerelated controls in the baselines established for the national security community, if so designated, may differ from those
controls designated for non-national security systems.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Why Assurance Matters
The importance of security assurance can be described by using the example of a light switch on a
wall in the living room of your house. Individuals can observe that by simply turning the switch on and
off, the switch appears to be performing according to its functional specification. This is analogous to
conducting black-box testing of security functionality in an information system or system component.
However, the more important questions might be—
•

Does the light switch do anything else besides what it is supposed to do?

•

What does the light switch look like from behind the wall?

•

What types of components were used to construct the light switch and how was the switch
assembled?

•

Did the switch manufacturer follow industry best practices in the development process?

This example is analogous to the many developmental activities that address the quality of the
security functionality in an information system or system component including, for example, design
principles, coding techniques, code analysis, testing, and evaluation.
The security assurance requirements and associated assurance-related controls in Appendix E
address the light switch problem from the front of the wall perspective, and potentially from the
behind the wall perspective, depending on the measure of confidence needed about the component
in question. For organizational missions/business functions that are less critical (i.e., low impact),
lower levels of assurance might be appropriate. However, as missions/business functions become
more important (i.e., moderate or high impact) and information systems and organizations become
susceptible to advanced persistent threats by high-end adversaries, increased levels of assurance
may be required. In addition, as organizations become more dependent on external information
system services and providers, assurance becomes more important—providing greater insight and
measures of confidence to organizations in understanding and verifying the security capability of
external providers and the services provided to the federal government. Thus, when the potential
impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation is
great, an increasing level of effort must be directed at what is happening behind the wall.

2.7 REVISIONS AND EXTENSIONS
The security controls listed in this publication represent the state-of-the-practice safeguards and
countermeasures for federal information systems and organizations. The security controls 57 will
be carefully reviewed and revised periodically to reflect:
•

Experience gained from using the controls;

•

New federal legislation, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, or policies;

•

Changing security requirements;

•

Emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attack methods; and

•

Availability of new technologies.

The security controls in the security control catalog are expected to change over time, as controls
are withdrawn, revised, and added. The security controls defined in the low, moderate, and high
baselines are also expected to change over time as the level of security and due diligence for
mitigating risks within organizations changes. In addition to the need for change, the need for
stability is addressed by requiring that proposed modifications to security controls go through a
57

The privacy controls listed in Appendix J will also be updated on a regular basis using similar criteria.

rigorous public review process to obtain both public and private sector feedback and to build
consensus for such change. This provides over time, a stable, flexible, and technically sound set
of security controls for the federal government, contractors, and any other organizations using the
security control catalog.

CHAPTER THREE

THE PROCESS
SELECTION AND SPECIFICATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS

T

his chapter describes the process of selecting and specifying security controls and control
enhancements for organizational information systems to include: (i) selecting appropriate
security control baselines; (ii) tailoring the baselines; (iii) documenting the security control
selection process; and (iv) applying the control selection process to new development and legacy
systems.

3.1 SELECTING SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES
In preparation for selecting and specifying the appropriate security controls for organizational
information systems and their respective environments of operation, organizations first determine
the criticality and sensitivity of the information to be processed, stored, or transmitted by those
systems. This process, known as security categorization, is described in FIPS Publication 199. 58
The security categorization standard is based on a simple and well-established concept—that is,
determining the potential adverse impact for organizational information systems. The results of
security categorization help guide and inform the selection of appropriate security controls (i.e.,
safeguards and countermeasures) to adequately protect those information systems. The security
controls selected for information systems are commensurate with the potential adverse impact on
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation if there is a
loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. FIPS Publication 199 requires organizations to
categorize information systems as low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact for the stated
security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (RMF Step 1). The potential
impact values assigned to the security objectives are the highest values (i.e., high water mark)
from the security categories that have been determined for each type of information processed,
stored, or transmitted by those information systems. 59 The generalized format for expressing the
security category (SC) of an information system is:
SC information system

= {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)},

where the acceptable values for potential impact are low, moderate, or high.

Since the potential impact values for confidentiality, integrity, and availability may not always be
the same for a particular information system, the high water mark concept (introduced in FIPS
Publication 199) is used in FIPS Publication 200 to determine the impact level of the information
system for the express purpose of selecting an initial set of security controls from one of the three
security control baselines.60 Thus, a low-impact system is defined as an information system in
which all three of the security objectives are low. A moderate-impact system is an information
system in which at least one of the security objectives is moderate and no security objective is

58

CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security categorization guidance for national security systems.

59

NIST Special Publication 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security
Categories, provides guidance on the assignment of security categories to information systems.

60
The high water mark concept is employed because there are significant dependencies among the security objectives
of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In most cases, a compromise in one security objective ultimately affects
the other security objectives as well. Accordingly, security controls are not categorized by security objective. Rather,
the security controls are grouped into baselines to provide a general protection capability for classes of information
systems based on impact level.

CHAPTER 3

and Organizations

greater than moderate. Finally, a high-impact system is an information system in which at least
one security objective is high.

Implementation Tip
To determine the impact level of an information system:

•
•
•
•

First, determine the different types of information that are processed, stored, or transmitted by the
information system. NIST Special Publication 800-60 provides common information types.
Second, using the impact values in FIPS Publication 199 and the recommendations of NIST
Special Publication 800-60, categorize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of each
information type.
Third, determine the information system security categorization, that is, the highest impact value
for each security objective (confidentiality, integrity, availability) from among the categorizations
for the information types associated with the information system.
Fourth, determine the overall impact level of the information system from the highest impact value
among the three security objectives in the system security categorization.

Note: For national security systems, organizations use CNSSI 1253 for security categorization.

Once the impact level of the information system is determined, organizations begin the security
control selection process (RMF Step 2). The first step in selecting and specifying security controls
for the information system is to choose an appropriate set of baseline controls.61 The selection of
the initial security control baseline is based on the impact level of the information system as
determined by the security categorization process described above. The organization selects one
of three sets of baseline security controls from Appendix D corresponding to the low-impact,
moderate-impact, or high-impact rating of the information system. 62 Note that not all security
controls are assigned to baselines, as indicated in Table D-2 by the phrase not selected. Similarly,
as illustrated in Tables D-3 through D-19, not all control enhancements are assigned to baselines.
Those control enhancements that are assigned to baselines are so indicated by an “x” in the low,
moderate, or high columns. The use of the term baseline is intentional. The security controls and
control enhancements in the baselines are a starting point from which controls/enhancements may
be removed, added, or specialized based on the tailoring guidance in Section 3.2.
The security control baselines in Appendix D address the security needs of a broad and diverse
set of constituencies (including individual users and organizations). Some assumptions that
generally underlie the baselines in Appendix D include, for example: (i) the environments in
which organizational information systems operate; (ii) the nature of operations conducted by
organizations; (iii) the functionality employed within information systems; (iv) the types of
threats facing organizations, missions/business processes, and information systems; and (v) the
type of information processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems. Articulating the
underlying assumptions is a key element in the initial risk framing step of the risk management
process described in NIST Special Publication 800-39. Some of the assumptions that underlie the
baselines in Appendix D include:

61

The general security control selection process may be augmented or further detailed by additional sector-specific
guidance as described in Section 3.3, Creating Overlays, and Appendix I, template for developing overlays.
62

CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security control baselines for national security systems.

CHAPTER 3

PAGE 29

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

•

Information systems are located in physical facilities;

•

User data/information in organizational information systems is relatively persistent; 63

•

Information systems are multi-user (either serially or concurrently) in operation;

•

Some user data/information in organizational information systems is not shareable with other
users who have authorized access to the same systems;

•

Information systems exist in networked environments;

•

Information systems are general purpose in nature; and

•

Organizations have the necessary structure, resources, and infrastructure to implement the
controls. 64

If one or more of these assumptions is not valid, then some of the security controls assigned to the
initial baselines in Appendix D may not be applicable—a situation that can be readily addressed
by applying the tailoring guidance in Section 3.2 and the results of organizational assessments of
risk. Conversely, there are also some possible situations that are specifically not addressed in the
baselines. These include:
•

Insider threats exist within organizations;

•

Classified data/information is processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems;

•

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) exist within organizations;

•

Selected data/information requires specialized protection based on federal legislation,
directives, regulations, or policies; and

•

Information systems need to communicate with other systems across different security
domains.

If any of the above assumptions apply, then additional security controls from Appendix F would
likely be needed to ensure adequate protection—a situation that can also be effectively addressed
by applying the tailoring guidance in Section 3.2 (specifically, security control supplementation)
and the results of organizational assessments of risk.

3.2 TAILORING BASELINE SECURITY CONTROLS
After selecting the initial set of baseline security controls from Appendix D, organizations initiate
the tailoring process to modify appropriately and align the controls more closely with the specific
conditions within the organization (i.e., conditions related to organizational missions/business
functions, information systems, or environments of operation). The tailoring process includes:
•

Identifying and designating common controls in initial security control baselines;

•

Applying scoping considerations to the remaining baseline security controls;

•

Selecting compensating security controls, if needed;

63

Persistent data/information refers to data/information with utility for a relatively long duration (e.g., days, weeks).

64

In general, federal departments and agencies will satisfy this assumption. The assumption becomes more of an issue
for nonfederal entities such as municipalities, first responders, and small (business) contractors. Such entities may not
be large enough or sufficiently resourced to have elements dedicated to providing the range of security capabilities that
are assumed by the baselines. Organizations consider such factors in their risk-based decisions.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

•

Assigning specific values to organization-defined security control parameters via explicit
assignment and selection statements;

•

Supplementing baselines with additional security controls and control enhancements, if
needed; and

•

Providing additional specification information for control implementation, if needed.

The tailoring process, as an integral part of security control selection and specification, is part of a
comprehensive organizational risk management process—framing, assessing, responding to, and
monitoring information security risk. Organizations use risk management guidance to facilitate
risk-based decision making regarding the applicability of security controls in the security control
baselines. Ultimately, organizations use the tailoring process to achieve cost-effective, risk-based
security that supports organizational mission/business needs. Tailoring activities are approved by
authorizing officials in coordination with selected organizational officials (e.g., risk executive
[function], chief information officers, senior information security officers, information system
owners, common control providers) prior to implementing the security controls. Organizations
have the flexibility to perform the tailoring process at the organization level for all information
systems (either as a required tailored baseline or as the starting point for system-specific tailoring
activities), in support of a particular line of business or mission/business process, at the individual
information system level, or by using a combination of the above. 65
Conversely, organizations do not remove security controls for operational convenience. Tailoring
decisions regarding security controls should be defensible based on mission/business needs and
accompanied by explicit risk-based determinations. 66 Tailoring decisions, including the specific
rationale for those decisions, are documented in the security plans for organizational information
systems. Every security control from the initial set of baseline security controls is accounted for
either by the organization (e.g., common control provider) or by the information system owner. If
certain security controls are tailored out, then the associated rationale is recorded in security plans
(or references/pointers to other relevant documentation are provided) for the information systems
and approved by the responsible organizational officials as part of the security plan approval
process. 67
Documenting significant risk management decisions in the security control selection process is
imperative in order for authorizing officials to have the necessary information to make credible,
risk-based decisions with regard to the authorization of information systems. Since information
systems, environments of operation, and personnel associated with the system development life
cycle are subject to change, providing the assumptions, constraints, and rationale supporting those
important risk decisions allows for a better understanding in the future of the security state of the
information systems or environments of operation at the time the original risk decisions were
made and facilitates identifying changes, when previous risk decisions are revisited.

65

See also Section 3.3, Creating Overlays, and Appendix I, template for developing overlays.

66

Tailoring decisions can also be based on timing and applicability of selected security controls under certain defined
conditions. That is, security controls may not apply in every situation or the parameter values for assignment statements
may change under certain circumstances. Overlays can define these special situations, conditions, or timing-related
considerations.
67

The level of detail required in documenting tailoring decisions in the security control selection process is at the
discretion of organizations and reflects the impact levels of the respective information systems implementing or
inheriting the controls.

CHAPTER 3

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Identifying and Designating Common Controls
Common controls are controls that may be inherited by one or more organizational information
systems. If an information system inherits a common control, then that system does not need to
explicitly implement that control—that is, the security capability is being provided by another
entity. Therefore, when the security controls in Appendix F call for an information system to
implement or perform a particular security function, it should not be interpreted to mean that all
systems that are part of larger, more complex systems or all components of a particular system
need to implement the control or function. Organizational decisions on which security controls
are designated as common controls may greatly affect the responsibilities of individual system
owners with regard to the implementation of controls in a particular baseline. Common control
selection can also affect the overall resource expenditures by organizations (i.e., the greater the
number of common controls implemented, the greater potential cost savings).
Applying Scoping Considerations
Scoping considerations, when applied in conjunction with risk management guidance, provide
organizations with a more granular foundation with which to make risk-based decisions. 68 The
application of scoping considerations can eliminate unnecessary security controls from the initial
security control baselines and help to ensure that organizations select only those controls that are
needed to provide the appropriate level of protection for organizational information systems—
protection based on the missions and business functions being supported by those systems and the
environments in which the systems operate. Organizations may apply the scoping considerations
described below to assist with making risk-based decisions regarding security control selection
and specification—decisions that can potentially affect how the baseline security controls are
applied and implemented by organizations:
•

CONTROL ALLOCATION AND PLACEMENT CONSIDERATIONS—

The term information system can refer to systems at multiple levels of abstraction ranging
from system-of-systems to individual single-user systems. The growing complexity of many
information systems requires careful analysis in the allocation/placement of security controls
within the three tiers in the risk management hierarchy (organization level, mission/business
process level, and information system level) without imposing any specific architectural
views or solutions. 69 Security controls in the initial baselines represent an information
system-wide set of controls that may not be applicable to every component in the system.
Security controls are applicable only to information system components that provide or
support the information security capability addressed by the controls.70 Organizations make
explicit risk-based decisions about where to apply or allocate specific security controls in
organizational information systems in order to achieve the needed security capability and to
satisfy security requirements. 71 An example of this type of allocation is applying the
68

The scoping considerations listed in this section are exemplary and not intended to limit organizations in rendering
risk-based decisions based on other organization-defined considerations with appropriate rationale.
69
This is especially true with the advent of service-oriented architectures where specific services are provided to
implement a single function.
70

For example, auditing controls are typically applied to components of an information system that provide auditing
capability (e.g., servers, etc.) and are not necessarily applied to every user-level workstation within the organization.
Organizations should carefully assess the inventory of components that compose their information systems to
determine which security controls are applicable to the various components.
71

As information technology advances, more powerful and diverse functionality can be found in smart phones, tablets,
and other types of mobile devices. While tailor guidance may support not allocating a particular security control to a
specific technology or device, any residual risk associated with the absence of that control must be addressed in risk
assessments to adequately protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

requirement from AC-18 (1) (i.e., protecting wireless access to information systems using
authentication/encryption) to all wireless access except for wireless access to visitor
subnetworks which are not connected to other system components.
•

OPERATIONAL/ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—

Several of the security controls in the baselines are based on the assumption of the existence
of certain operational/environmental factors. Where these factors are absent or significantly
diverge from the baseline assumptions, it is justifiable to tailor the baseline. Some of the more
common operational/environmental factors include:
-

Mobility
The mobility of physical hosting environments can impact the set of security controls
selected for organizational information systems. As noted above, the initial set of security
controls assigned to the baselines in Appendix D assumes the operation of information
systems in fixed facilities and nonmobile locations. If those information systems operate
primarily in mobile environments, the initial set of security controls should be tailored
appropriately to account for the differences in mobility and accessibility of the locations
where the systems reside. For example, many of the security controls in the Physical and
Environmental Protection (PE) family that are selected in all initial baselines reflect the
assumption that the information systems reside in physical facilities/complexes that
require appropriate physical protections. Such controls would likely not provide added
value for mobile environments such as ships, aircraft, automobiles, vans, or space-based
systems. 72

-

Single-User Systems and Operations
For information systems that are designed to operate as single-user systems (e.g., smart
phones), several of the security controls that address sharing among users may not be
needed. A single-user system or device refers to a system/device that is only intended to
be used by a single individual over time (i.e., exclusive use). Systems or devices that are
shared by multiple users over time are not considered single-user. Security controls such
as AC-10, Concurrent Session Control, SC-4, Information in Shared Resources, and AC3, Access Enforcement 73 may not be required in single-user systems/operations and could
reasonably be tailored out of the baseline at the discretion of organizations.

-

Data Connectivity and Bandwidth
While many information systems are interconnected, there are some systems which for
security or operational reasons, lack networking capabilities—that is, the systems are air
gapped from the network. For nonnetworked systems, security controls such as AC-17,
Remote Access, SC-8, Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity, and SC-7, Boundary
Protection, are not applicable and may be tailored out of the security control baselines at
the discretion of organizations. In addition to nonnetworked information systems, there
are systems that have very limited or sporadic bandwidth (e.g., tactical systems that
support warfighter or law enforcement missions). For such systems, the application of
security controls would need to be examined carefully as the limited and/or sporadic
bandwidth could impact the practicality of implementing those controls and the viability
of adversaries staging cyber attacks over the limited bandwidth.

72
The mobile nature of devices means that it is possible that, for some period of time, the devices may reside in fixed
facilities or complexes in fixed locations. During that time, the PE controls would likely apply.
73

Organizations consider whether individual users have administrator privileges before removing AC-3 from security
control baselines.

CHAPTER 3

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

-

Limited Functionality Systems or System Components
What constitutes an information system under the E-Government Act of 2002 is quite
broad. Fax machines, printers, scanners, pagers, smart phones, tablets, E-readers, and
digital cameras can all be categorized as information systems (or system components).
These types of systems and components may lack the general processing capabilities
assumed in the security control baselines. The nature of these constraints may limit the
types of threats that these systems face, and hence the appropriateness of some of the
security controls. Thus, a control such as SI-3, Malicious Code Protection (required in all
control baselines) may not be practical for information systems or components that are
not capable of executing code (e.g., text-only pagers). However, because there is often no
clear delineation between these types of information systems or components (e.g., smart
phones combine the digital capabilities of telephones, cameras, and computers), it is
important that the application of security controls to limited functionality systems or
components be done judiciously and always take into account the intended use of the
systems, system capabilities, and the risk of compromise.

-

Information and System Non-Persistence
There is often an assumption that user information within organizational information
systems is persistent for a considerable period of time. However, for some applications
and environments of operation (e.g., tactical systems, industrial control systems), the
persistence of user information is often very limited in duration. For information systems
processing, storing, or transmitting such non-persistent information, several security
controls in the Contingency Planning (CP) family such as CP-6, Alternate Storage Site,
CP-7, Alternate Processing Site, and CP-9, Information System Backup, may not be
practical and can be tailored out at the discretion of organizations. For similar reasons,
controls such as MP-6, Media Sanitization, and SC-28, Protection of Information at Rest,
are good candidates for removal through tailoring. 74 In addition to the non-persistence of
information, the information systems/services may be non-persistent as well. This can be
achieved by the use of virtualization techniques to establish non-persistent instantiations
of operating systems and applications. Depending on the duration of the instantiations,
some baseline controls might not be applicable.

-

Public Access
When public access to organizational information systems is allowed, security controls
should be applied with discretion since some security controls from the specified control
baselines (e.g., identification and authentication, personnel security controls) may not be
applicable for public access. Thus, in the case of the general public accessing federal
government websites (e.g., to download publically accessible information such as forms,
emergency preparedness information), security controls such as AC-7, Unsuccessful
Logon Attempts, AC-17, Remote Access, IA-2, Identification and Authentication, IA-4,
Identifier Management, and IA-5, Authenticator Management, typically would not be
relevant for validating access authorizations or privileges. However, many of these
controls would still be needed for identifying and authenticating organizational personnel
that maintain and support information systems providing such public access websites and
services. Similarly, many of the security controls may still be required for users accessing
nonpublic information systems through such public interfaces, for example, to access or
change personal information.

74
Organizations balance information persistence with the sensitivity of the information. Non-persistent information
may still require sanitization after deletion. In addition, organizations consider the duration of information sensitivity—
some information may be persistent, but only be sensitive for a limited time.

•

SECURITY OBJECTIVE-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—

Security controls that support only one or two of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability
security objectives may be downgraded to the corresponding control in a lower baseline (or
modified or eliminated if not defined in a lower baseline) only if the downgrading action: (i)
reflects the FIPS Publication 199 security category for the supported security objective(s)
before moving to the FIPS Publication 200 impact level (i.e., high water mark); 75 (ii) is
supported by an organizational assessment of risk; and (iii) does not adversely affect the level
of protection for the security-relevant information within the information system. 76 For
example, if an information system is categorized as moderate impact using the high water
mark concept because confidentiality and/or integrity are moderate but availability is low,
there are several controls that only support the availability security objective and that
potentially could be downgraded to low baseline requirements—that is, it may be appropriate
not to implement CP-2 (1) because the control enhancement supports only availability and is
selected in the moderate baseline but not in the low baseline. The following security controls
and control enhancements are potential candidates for downgrading: 77

•

-

Confidentiality: AC-21, MA-3 (3), MP-3, MP-4, MP-5, MP-5 (4), MP-6 (1), MP-6 (2),
PE-4, PE-5, SC-4, SC-8, SC-8 (1);

-

Integrity: CM-5, CM-5 (1), CM-5 (3), SC-8, SC-8 (1), SI-7, SI-7 (1), SI-7 (5), SI-10; and

-

Availability: CP-2 (1), CP-2 (2), CP-2 (3), CP-2 (4), CP-2 (5), CP-2 (8), CP-3 (1), CP-4
(1), CP-4 (2), CP-6, CP-6 (1), CP-6 (2), CP-6 (3), CP-7, CP-7 (1), CP-7 (2), CP-7 (3),
CP-7 (4), CP-8, CP-8 (1), CP-8 (2), CP-8 (3), CP-8 (4), CP-9 (1), CP-9 (2), CP-9 (3), CP9 (5), CP-10 (2), CP-10 (4), MA-6, PE-9, PE-10, PE-11, PE-11 (1), PE-13 (1), PE-13 (2),
PE-13 (3), PE-15 (1).

TECHNOLOGY-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—

Security controls that refer to specific technologies (e.g., wireless, cryptography, public key
infrastructure) are applicable only if those technologies are employed or are required to be
employed within organizational information systems. Security controls that can be explicitly
or implicitly supported by automated mechanisms do not require the development of such
mechanisms if the mechanisms do not already exist or are not readily available in commercial
or government off-the-shelf products. If automated mechanisms are not readily available,
75
When applying the high water mark in Section 3.1, some of the original FIPS Publication 199 confidentiality,
integrity, or availability security objectives may have been upgraded to a higher security control baseline. As part of
this process, security controls that uniquely support the confidentiality, integrity, or availability security objectives may
have been upgraded unnecessarily. Consequently, it is recommended that organizations consider appropriate and
allowable downgrading actions to ensure cost-effective, risk-based application of security controls.
76

Information that is security-relevant at the information system level (e.g., password files, network routing tables,
cryptographic key management information) is distinguished from user-level information within the same system.
Certain security controls are used to support the security objectives of confidentiality and integrity for both user-level
and system-level information. Caution should be exercised in downgrading confidentiality or integrity-related security
controls to ensure that downgrading actions do not result in insufficient protection for the security-relevant information
within the information system. Security-relevant information must be protected at the high water mark in order to
achieve a similar level of protection for any of the security objectives related to user-level information.
77

Downgrading actions apply only to the moderate and high baselines. Security controls that are uniquely attributable
to confidentiality, integrity, or availability that would ordinarily be considered as potential candidates for downgrading
(e.g., AC-16, AU-10, IA-7, PE-12, PE-14, SC-5, SC-13, SC-16) are eliminated from consideration because the controls
are either selected for use in all baselines and have no enhancements that could be downgraded, or the controls are
optional and not selected for use in any baseline. Organizations should exercise caution when downgrading security
controls that do not appear in the list in Section 3.2 to ensure that downgrading actions do not affect security objectives
other than the objectives targeted for downgrading.

cost-effective, or technically feasible, compensating security controls, implemented through
nonautomated mechanisms or procedures, are used to satisfy specified security controls or
control enhancements (see terms and conditions for applying compensating controls below).
•

MISSION REQUIREMENTS-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—

Some security controls may not be applicable (or appropriate) if implementing those controls
has the potential to degrade, debilitate, or otherwise hamper critical organizational missions
and/or business functions. For example, if the mission requires that an uninterrupted display
of mission-critical information be available at an operator console (e.g., air traffic controller
console), the implementation of AC-11, Session Lock, or SC-10, Network Disconnect, may
not be appropriate.
Selecting Compensating Security Controls
Organizations may find it necessary on occasion to employ compensating security controls.
Compensating controls are alternative security controls employed by organizations in lieu of
specific controls in the low, moderate, or high baselines described in Appendix D—controls that
provide equivalent or comparable protection for organizational information systems and the
information processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems. 78 This may occur, for example,
when organizations are unable to effectively implement specific security controls in the baselines
or when, due to the specific nature of the information systems or environments of operation, the
controls in the baselines are not a cost-effective means of obtaining the needed risk mitigation.
Compensating controls are typically selected after applying the scoping considerations in the
tailoring guidance to the initial set of baseline security controls. Compensating controls may be
employed by organizations under the following conditions:
•
•

•

Organizations select compensating controls from Appendix F; if appropriate compensating
controls are not available, organizations adopt suitable compensating controls from other
sources; 79
Organizations provide supporting rationale for how compensating controls provide equivalent
security capabilities for organizational information systems and why the baseline security
controls could not be employed; and
Organizations assess and accept the risk associated with implementing compensating controls
in organizational information systems.

Assigning Security Control Parameter Values
Security controls and control enhancements containing embedded parameters (i.e., assignment
and selection statements) give organizations the flexibility to define certain portions of controls
and enhancements to support specific organizational requirements. After the initial application of
scoping considerations and the selection of compensating controls, organizations review the
security controls and control enhancements for assignment/selection statements and determine
appropriate organization-defined values for the identified parameters. Parameter values may be
prescribed by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, or
standards. Once organizations define the parameter values for security controls and control
78

More than one compensating control may be required to provide the equivalent protection for a particular security
control in Appendix F. For example, organizations with significant staff limitations may compensate for the separation
of duty security control by strengthening the audit, accountability, and personnel security controls.
79

Organizations should make every attempt to select compensating controls from the security control catalog in
Appendix F. Organization-defined compensating controls are employed only when organizations determine that the
security control catalog does not contain suitable compensating controls.

PAGE 36

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

enhancements, the assignments and selections become a part of the control and enhancement. 80
Organizations may choose to specify the values for security control parameters before selecting
compensating controls since the specification of the parameters completes the control definitions
and may affect compensating control requirements. There can also be significant benefits in
collaborating on the development of parameter values. For organizations that work together on a
frequent basis, it may be useful for those organizations to develop a mutually agreeable set of
uniform values for security control parameters. Doing so may assist organizations in achieving a
greater degree of reciprocity when depending upon the information systems and/or services
offered by other organizations.
Supplementing Security Control Baselines
The final determination of the appropriate set of security controls necessary to provide adequate
security for organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems
operate is a function of the assessment of risk and what is required to sufficiently mitigate the
risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. 81
In many cases, additional security controls or control enhancements (beyond those controls and
enhancements contained in the baselines in Appendix D) will be required to address specific
threats to and vulnerabilities in organizations, mission/business processes, and/or information
systems and to satisfy the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, standards, or regulations. 82 The risk assessment in the security control selection process
provides essential information in determining the necessity and sufficiency of the security
controls and control enhancements in the initial baselines. Organizations are encouraged to make
maximum use of Appendix F to facilitate the process of supplementing the initial baselines with
additional security controls and/or control enhancements. 83
Situations Requiring Potential Baseline Supplementation
Organizations may be subject to conditions that, from an operational, environmental, or threat
perspective, warrant the selection and implementation of additional (supplemental) controls to
achieve adequate protection of organizational missions/business functions and the information
systems supporting those missions/functions. Examples of conditions and additional controls that
might be required are provided below.
•

ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT

Security control baselines do not assume that the current threat environment is one where
adversaries have achieved a significant foothold and presence within organizations and
organizational information systems—that is, organizations are dealing with an advanced
persistent threat (APT). Adversaries continue to attack organizational information systems
and the information technology infrastructure and are successful in some aspects of such
attacks. To more fully address the advanced persistent threat, concepts such as insider threat
80

CNSS Instruction 1253 provides assignment of minimum values for organization-defined variables applicable to
national security systems. Parameter values can also be defined as part of overlays described in Section 3.4.
81
Considerations for potential national-level impacts and impacts to other organizations in categorizing organizational
information systems derive from the USA PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security Presidential Directives.
82
In previous versions of Special Publication 800-53, tailoring referred only to the removal of security controls from
baselines and supplementation referred only to the addition of controls to baselines. In this document, the term tailoring
has been redefined to include both the addition of security controls to baselines (i.e., tailoring up) and the removal of
controls from baselines (i.e., tailoring down).
83

Security controls and control enhancements selected to supplement baselines are allocated to appropriate information
system components in the same manner as the control allocations carried out by organizations in the initial baselines.

CHAPTER 3

________________________________________________________________________________________________

protection (CM-5 (4)), heterogeneity (SC-29), deception (SC-26 and SC-30), non-persistence
(SC-25 and SC-34), and segmentation (SC-7 (13)) can be considered.
•

CROSS-DOMAIN SERVICES

Security control baselines do not assume that information systems have to operate across
multiple security domains. The baselines assume a flat view of information flows (i.e., the
same security policies in different domains when information moves across authorization
boundaries). To address cross-domain services and transactions, some subset of the AC-4
security control enhancements can be considered to ensure adequate protection of information
when transferred between information systems with different security policies.
•

MOBILITY

The use of mobile devices might result in the need for additional security controls and control
enhancements not selected in the initial baselines. For example, AC-7 (2), which requires the
purging/wiping of information after an organization-defined number of unsuccessful logon
attempts, or MP-6 (8), which requires the capability for remote purging/wiping, could be
selected in order to address the threat of theft or loss of mobile devices.
•

CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

In some environments, classified and sensitive information 84 may be resident on national
security systems without all users having the necessary authorizations to access all of the
information. In those situations, additional security controls are required to ensure that
information requiring strict separation is not accessed by unauthorized users. More stringent
access controls include, for example, AC-3 (3) and AC-16. When classified information is
being processed, stored, or transmitted on information systems that are jointly owned by
multiple entities (e.g., coalition partners in military alliances), more restrictive controls for
maintenance personnel may be required including, for example, MA-5 (4).
Processes for Identifying Additional Needed Security Controls
Organizations can employ a requirements definition approach or a gap analysis approach in
selecting security controls and control enhancements to supplement initial baselines. In the
requirements definition approach, organizations obtain specific and credible threat 85 information
(or make reasonable assumptions) about the activities of adversaries with certain capabilities or
attack potential (e.g., skill levels, expertise, available resources). To effectively withstand cyber
attacks from adversaries with the stated capabilities or attack potential, organizations strive to
achieve a certain level of defensive capability or cyber preparedness. Organizations can select
additional security controls and control enhancements from Appendix F to obtain such defensive
capability or level of preparedness. In contrast to the requirements definition approach, the gap
analysis approach begins with an organizational assessment of its current defensive capability or
level of cyber preparedness. From that initial capability assessment, organizations determine the
types of threats they can reasonably expect to counter. If the current organizational defensive
capabilities or levels of cyber preparedness are insufficient, the gap analysis determines the
required capabilities and levels of preparedness. Organizations subsequently define the security
controls and control enhancements from Appendix F needed to achieve the desired capabilities or
cyber-preparedness levels. Both of the approaches described above require timely and accurate

84

The example is illustrative only. CNSS Instruction 1253 provides specific guidance regarding security controls
required for national security systems.
85
While this example focuses on threats to information systems from purposeful attacks, the threat space of concern to
organizations also includes environmental disruptions and human errors.

CHAPTER 3

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

threat information. It is essential that organizations work with the appropriate threat identification
component to obtain such information.
During the tailoring process, organizations consider reevaluating the priority codes from the
security control baselines to determine if any changes to those priorities are appropriate. This is
especially important when adding security controls that are not included in any of the baselines,
because those controls have priority codes of P0. The reevaluation of priority codes can be based
on organizational assessments of risk or design/developmental decisions related to the security
architecture or the systems and security engineering process that may require certain sequencing
in security control implementation.
Enhancing Information Security without Changing Control Selection
There may be situations in which organizations cannot apply sufficient security controls within
their information systems to adequately reduce or mitigate risk (e.g., when using certain types of
information technologies or employing certain computing paradigms). Therefore, alternative
strategies are needed to prevent organizational missions/business functions from being adversely
affected— strategies that consider the mission and business risks resulting from an aggressive use
of information technology. Restrictions on the types of technologies used and how organizational
information systems are employed provide an alternative method to reduce or mitigate risk that
may be used in conjunction with, or instead of, supplemental security controls. Restrictions on the
use of information systems and specific information technologies may be, in some situations, the
only practical or reasonable actions organizations can take in order to have the capability to carry
out assigned missions/business functions in the face of determined adversaries. Examples of use
restrictions include:
•

Limiting the information that information systems can process, store, or transmit or the
manner in which organizational missions/business functions are automated;

•

Prohibiting external access to organizational information by removing selected information
system components from networks (i.e., air gapping); and

•

Prohibiting moderate- or high-impact information on organizational information system
components to which the public has access, unless an explicit risk determination is made
authorizing such access.

Providing Additional Specification Information for Control Implementation
Since security controls are statements of security capability at higher levels of abstraction, the
controls may lack sufficient information for successful implementation. Therefore, additional
detail may be necessary to fully define the intent of a given security control for implementation
purposes and to ensure that the security requirements related to that control are satisfied. For
example, additional information may be provided as part of the process of moving from control to
specification requirement, and may involve refinement of implementation details, refinement of
scope, or iteration to apply the same control differently to different scopes. Organizations ensure
that if existing security control information (e.g., selection and assignment statements) is not
sufficient to fully define the intended application of the control, such information is provided.
Organizations have the flexibility to determine whether additional detail is included as a part of
the control statement, in supplemental guidance, or in a separate control addendum section. When
providing additional detail, organizations are cautioned not to change the intent of the security
control or modify the original language in the control. The additional implementation information
can be documented either in security plans or systems and security engineering plans. The type of

CHAPTER 3

and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

additional detail that might be necessary to fully specify a security control for implementation
purposes is provided in the SI-7 (6) example below:
SI-7

SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY

SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to
software, firmware, and information.

Cryptographic mechanisms used for the protection of integrity include,
for example, digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using
asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash,
and using the public key to verify the hash information. Related control: SC-13.
Supplemental Guidance:

Additional implementation detail for SI-7 (6):
Digital signatures are applied to all traffic for which non-repudiation is required employing
SHA-256 or another approved NIST algorithm demonstrably of at least the same strength of
mechanism.

3.3 CREATING OVERLAYS
The previous sections described the process of tailoring a set of initial baseline security controls
to achieve a more focused and relevant security capability for organizations. In certain situations,
it may be beneficial for organizations to apply tailoring guidance to the baselines to develop a set
of security controls for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies,
or unique missions/environments of operation. 86 For example, the federal government may decide
to establish a governmentwide set of security controls and implementation guidance for: (i) public
key infrastructure (PKI) systems that could be uniformly applied to all PKI systems implemented
within federal agencies; (ii) cloud-based information systems that are uniformly applied to all
federal agencies procuring or implementing cloud services; or (iii) industrial control systems
(ICSs) at federal facilities producing electric power or controlling environmental systems in
federal facilities. Alternatively, to address particular communities of interest with specialized
requirements, the Department of Defense, for example, may decide to establish a set of security
controls and implementation guidance for its tactical operations and environments by applying
the tailoring guidance to the standard security control baselines for national security systems to
achieve more specialized solutions. In each of the above examples, tailored baselines can be
developed for each information technology area or for the unique circumstances/environments
and promulgated to large communities of interest—thus achieving standardized security
capabilities, consistency of implementation, and cost-effective security solutions.
To address the need for developing community-wide and specialized sets of security controls for
information systems and organizations, the concept of overlay is introduced. An overlay is a fully
specified set of security controls, control enhancements, and supplemental guidance derived from
the application of tailoring guidance in Section 3.2 to security control baselines in Appendix D. 87
Overlays complement the initial security control baselines by: (i) providing the opportunity to add
or eliminate controls; (ii) providing security control applicability and interpretations for specific
information technologies, computing paradigms, environments of operation, types of information
systems, types of missions/operations, operating modes, industry sectors, and statutory/regulatory
requirements; (iii) establishing community-wide parameter values for assignment and/or selection
statements in security controls and control enhancements; and (iv) extending the supplemental
guidance for security controls, where necessary. Organizations typically use the overlay concept
86

This type of tailoring can be conducted at the federal level or by individual organizations.

87

CNSS Instruction 1253 provides tailoring guidance and security control baselines for national security systems.

CHAPTER 3

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

when there is divergence from the basic assumptions used to create the initial security control
baselines (see Section 3.1). If organizations are not divergent from the basic assumptions for the
initial baselines, there is likely no need to create an overlay. Alternatively, the baselines may be
missing key assumptions which would justify creating an overlay with additional assumptions.
The full range of tailoring activities can be employed by organizations to provide a disciplined
and structured approach for developing tailored baselines supporting the areas described above.
Overlays provide an opportunity to build consensus across communities of interest and develop
security plans for organizational information systems that have broad-based support for very
specific circumstances, situations, and/or conditions. Categories of overlays that may be useful
include, for example:
•

Communities of interest, industry sectors, or coalitions/partnerships (e.g., healthcare, law
enforcement, intelligence, financial, transportation, energy, allied collaboration/sharing);

•

Information technologies/computing paradigms (e.g., cloud/mobile, PKI, Smart Grid, crossdomain solutions);

•

Environments of operation (e.g., space, tactical);

•

Types of information systems and operating modes (e.g., industrial/process control systems,
weapons systems, single-user systems, standalone systems);

•

Types of missions/operations (e.g., counterterrorism, first responders, research, development,
test, and evaluation); and

•

Statutory/regulatory requirements (e.g., Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Privacy Act).

Organizations can effectively use the risk management concepts defined in NIST Special
Publication 800-39 when developing overlays. The successful development of overlays requires
the involvement of: (i) information security professionals who understand the specific subject
area that is the focus of the overlay development effort; and (ii) subject matter experts in the
overlay area who understand the security controls in Appendix F and the initial baselines in
Appendix D. The format and structure for developing overlays is provided in Appendix I.
Multiple overlays can be applied to a single security control baseline. The tailored baselines that
result from the overlay development process may be more or less stringent than the original
security control baselines. Risk assessments provide information necessary to determine if the
risk from implementing the tailored baselines falls within the risk tolerance of the organizations
or communities of interest developing the overlays. If multiple overlays are employed, it is
possible that there could be a conflict between the overlays. If the use of multiple overlays results
in conflicts between the application or removal of security controls, the authorizing official (or
designee), in coordination with the mission/business owner and/or information owner/steward,
can resolve the conflict. In general, overlays are intended to reduce the need for ad hoc tailoring
of baselines by organizations through the selection of a set of controls and control enhancements
that more closely correspond to common circumstances, situations, and/or conditions. However,
the use of overlays does not preclude organizations from performing further tailoring to reflect
organization-specific needs, assumptions, or constraints. Tailoring of overlays is accomplished
within the constraints defined within the overlay and may require the concurrence/approval of the
authorizing official or other organization-designated individuals. For example, an overlay created
for an industrial control system (ICS) may require tailoring for applicability to a specific type of
ICS and its environment of operation. But it is anticipated that the use of overlays would greatly
reduce the number and extent of organization-specific ad hoc tailoring.

3.4 DOCUMENTING THE CONTROL SELECTION PROCESS
Organizations document the relevant decisions taken during the security control selection process,
providing a sound rationale for those decisions. This documentation is essential when examining
the security considerations for organizational information systems with respect to the potential
mission/business impact. The resulting set of security controls and the supporting rationale for the
selection decisions (including any information system use restrictions required by organizations)
are documented in the security plans. Documenting significant risk management decisions in the
security control selection process is imperative so that authorizing officials can have access to the
necessary information to make informed authorization decisions for organizational information
systems. 88 Without such information, the understanding, assumptions, constraints, and rationale
supporting those risk management decisions will, in all likelihood, not be available when the state
of the information systems or environments of operation change, and the original risk decisions
are revisited. Figure 4 summarizes the security control selection process, including the selection
of initial baselines and the tailoring of the baselines by applying the guidance in Section 3.2.

FIGURE 4: SECURITY CONTROL SELECTION PROCESS

Iterative and Dynamic Nature of Security Control Tailoring
The security control tailoring process described above, while appearing to be sequential in nature,
can also have an iterative aspect. Organizations may choose to execute the tailoring steps in any
order based on organizational needs and the information generated from risk assessments. For
example, some organizations may establish the parameter values for security controls in the initial
baselines prior to selecting compensating controls. Other organizations may delay completing
assignment and selection statements in the controls until after the supplementation activities have
been completed. Organizations may also discover that when fully specifying security controls for
the intended environments of operation, there may be difficulties that arise which may trigger the
need for additional (supplemental) controls. Finally, the security control tailoring process is not
static—that is, organizations revisit the tailoring step as often as needed based on ongoing
organizational assessments of risk.
88
The security control selection process also applies to common control providers and the authorizing officials
rendering authorization decisions for common controls deployed within organizations.

CHAPTER 3

PAGE 42

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

In addition to the iterative and dynamic nature of the security control tailoring process, there may
also be side effects as controls are added and removed from the baselines. Security controls in
Appendix F can have some degree of dependency and functional overlap with other controls. In
many cases, security controls work together to achieve a security capability. Thus, removing a
particular security control from a baseline during the tailoring process may have unintended side
effects (and potentially adverse impacts) on the remaining controls. Alternatively, adding a new
security control to a baseline during the tailoring process may eliminate or reduce the need for
certain specific controls because the new control provides a better security capability than the
capability provided by other controls. For example, if organizations implement SC-30 (2) using
virtualization techniques to randomly/frequently deploy diverse and changing operating systems
and applications, this approach could potentially limit the requirement to update the security
configurations in CM-2 (2). Therefore, the addition or removal of security controls is viewed with
regard to the totality of the information security needs of the organization and its information
systems, and not simply with regard to the controls being added or removed.

Implementation Tip
In diverging from the security control baselines during the tailoring process, organizations consider
some very important linkages between various controls and control enhancements. These linkages
are captured in the selection of controls and enhancements in the baselines and are especially
significant when developing overlays (described in Section 3.3 and Appendix I). In some instances,
the linkages are such that it is not meaningful to include a security control or control enhancement
without some other control or enhancement. The totality of the controls and enhancements provide a
required security capability. Some linkages are obvious such as the linkage between Mandatory
Access Control enhancement (AC-3 (3)) and Security Attributes (AC-16). But other linkages may be
more subtle. This is especially true in the case where the linkage is between security functionalityrelated controls and security assurance-related controls as described in Appendix E. For example, it
is not particularly meaningful to implement AC-3 (3) without also implementing a Reference Monitor
(AC-25). Organizations are encouraged to pay careful attention to the related controls section of the
Supplemental Guidance for the security controls to help in identifying such linkages.

Other Considerations
Organizational tailoring decisions are not carried out in a vacuum. While such decisions are
rightly focused on information security considerations, it is important that the decisions be
aligned with other risk factors that organizations address routinely. Risk factors such as cost,
schedule, and performance are considered in the overall determination of which security controls
to employ in organizational information systems and environments of operation. For example, in
military command and control systems in which lives may be at stake, the adoption of security
controls is balanced with operational necessity. With respect to the air traffic control system and
consoles used by air traffic controllers, the need to access the consoles in real time to control the
air space outweighs the security need for an AC-11, Session Lock. In short, the security control
selection process (to include tailoring activities described in Section 3.2) should be integrated into
the overall risk management process as described in NIST Special Publication 800-39.
Finally, organizations factor scalability into the security control selection process—that is,
controls are scalable with regard to the extent/rigor of the implementation. Scalability is guided
by the FIPS Publication 199 security categorizations and the associated FIPS Publication 200
impact levels of the information systems where the controls are to be applied. For example,
contingency plans for high-impact information systems may contain significant amounts of

CHAPTER 3

PAGE 43

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

implementation detail and be quite lengthy. In contrast, contingency plans for low-impact systems
may contain considerably less detail and be quite succinct. Organizations use discretion in
applying the security controls to organizational information systems, giving consideration to the
scalability factors in particular operational environments. Scaling controls to the appropriate
system impact level facilitates a more cost-effective, risk-based approach to security control
implementation—expending only the level of resources necessary to achieve sufficient risk
mitigation and adequate security.

Implementation Tip
Maintaining a record of security control selection and control status can be addressed in one or
multiple documents or security plans. If using multiple documents, consider providing references to
the necessary information in the relevant documents rather than requiring duplication of information.
Using references to relevant documentation reduces the amount of time and resources needed by
organizations to generate such information. Other benefits include greater security awareness and
understanding of the information system capabilities. Increased security awareness/understanding
supports more effective integration of information security into organizational information systems.

3.5 NEW DEVELOPMENT AND LEGACY SYSTEMS
The security control selection process described in this section can be applied to organizational
information systems from two different perspectives: (i) new development; and (ii) legacy. For
new development systems, the security control selection process is applied from a requirements
definition perspective since the systems do not yet exist and organizations are conducting initial
security categorizations. The security controls included in the security plans for the information
systems serve as a security specification and are expected to be incorporated into the systems
during the development and implementation phases of the system development life cycle. In
contrast, for legacy information systems, the security control selection process is applied from a
gap analysis perspective when organizations are anticipating significant changes to the systems
(e.g., during major upgrades, modifications, or outsourcing). Since the information systems
already exist, organizations in all likelihood have completed the security categorization and
security control selection processes resulting in the establishment of previously agreed-upon
security controls in the respective security plans and the implementation of those controls within
the information systems. Therefore, the gap analysis can be applied in the following manner:
•

First, reconfirm or update as necessary, the security category and impact level for the
information system based on the types of information that are currently being processed,
stored, or transmitted by the system.

•

Second, review the existing security plan that describes the security controls that are currently
employed considering any updates to the security category and information system impact
level as well as any changes to the organization, mission/business processes, the system, or
the operational environment. Reassess the risk and revise the security plan as necessary,
including documenting any additional security controls that would be needed by the system to
ensure that the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation, remains at an acceptable level.

•

Third, implement the security controls described in the updated security plan, document in the
plan of action and milestones any controls not implemented, and continue with the remaining
steps in the Risk Management Framework in the same manner as a new development system.

and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Applying Gap Analyses to External Service Providers
The gap analysis perspective is also applied when interacting with external service providers. As
described in Section 2.5, organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on external providers for
information system services. Using the steps in the gap analysis described above, organizations
can effectively use the acquisition process and appropriate contractual vehicles to require external
providers to carry out the security categorization and security control selection steps in the RMF.
The resulting information can help determine what security controls the external provider either
has in place or intends to implement for the information system services that are to be provided.
If a security control deficit exists, the responsibility for adequately mitigating unacceptable risks
arising from the use of external information system services remains with authorizing officials. In
such situations, organizations can reduce the organizational risk to an acceptable level by:
•

Using the existing contractual vehicle to require the external provider to meet the additional
security control requirements established by the organization;

•

Negotiating with the provider for additional security controls if the existing contractual
vehicle does not provide for such added requirements;

•

Approving the use of compensating controls by the provider; or

•

Employing alternative risk mitigation actions 89 within the organizational information system
when a contract either does not exist or the contract does not provide the necessary leverage
for organizations to obtain the needed security controls.

Implementation Tip
Many organizations operate and maintain complex information systems, often referred to as a
system-of-systems. Enterprise architecture plays a key part in the security control selection process
for these types of information systems. Organizations can address the complex system problem by
dividing the system into two or more subsystems and applying the FIPS 199 security categorization
and FIPS 200 impact level determination to each subsystem. Applying separate impact levels to
each subsystem does not change the overall impact level of the information system; rather, it allows
constituent subsystems to receive a separate allocation of security controls instead of deploying
higher-impact controls across every subsystem. It is not valid to treat the subsystems as entirely
independent entities, however, since the subsystems are interdependent and interconnected.
Organizations develop security architectures to allocate security controls among subsystems
including monitoring and controlling communications at key internal boundaries within the system
and provide system-wide controls that meet or exceed the highest information system impact level of
the constituent subsystems inheriting security capabilities from those controls. Organizations also
consider that replicated subsystems within complex systems may exhibit common vulnerabilities that
can be exploited by common threat sources—thereby negating the redundancy that might be relied
upon as a risk mitigation measure. The impact due to a security incident against one constituent
subsystem might cascade and impact many subsystems at the same time.

89
For example, local policies, procedures, and/or compensating controls could be established by organizations to serve
as alternative mitigation actions for risks identified in a gap analysis.

System
[FICAM Roadmap and
Implementation Guidance]

Low-Impact System
[FIPS 200]

An automated system that controls an individual’s ability to
access one or more computer system resources such as a
workstation, network, application, or database. A logical access
control system requires validation of an individual’s identity
through some mechanism such as a PIN, card, biometric, or other
token. It has the capability to assign different access privileges to
different persons depending on their roles and responsibilities in
an organization.
An information system in which all three security objectives (i.e.,
confidentiality, integrity, and availability) are assigned a FIPS
Publication 199 potential impact value of low.

Malicious Code

Software or firmware intended to perform an unauthorized
process that will have adverse impact on the confidentiality,
integrity, or availability of an information system. A virus, worm,
Trojan horse, or other code-based entity that infects a host.
Spyware and some forms of adware are also examples of
malicious code.

Malware

See Malicious Code.

Managed Interface

An interface within an information system that provides boundary
protection capability using automated mechanisms or devices.

Mandatory Access Control

An access control policy that is uniformly enforced across all
subjects and objects within the boundary of an information
system. A subject that has been granted access to information is
constrained from doing any of the following: (i) passing the
information to unauthorized subjects or objects; (ii) granting its
privileges to other subjects; (iii) changing one or more security
attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or system
components; (iv) choosing the security attributes to be associated
with newly-created or modified objects; or (v) changing the rules
governing access control. Organization-defined subjects may
explicitly be granted organization-defined privileges (i.e., they are
trusted subjects) such that they are not limited by some or all of
the above constraints.
A means of restricting access to objects based on the sensitivity
(as represented by a security label) of the information contained
in the objects and the formal authorization (i.e., clearance, formal
access approvals, and need-to-know) of subjects to access
information of such sensitivity. Mandatory Access Control is a
type of nondiscretionary access control.

Control

A security control for an information system that has not been
designated as a common security control or the portion of a
hybrid control that is to be implemented within an information
system.

Tailored Security Control
Baseline

A set of security controls resulting from the application of
tailoring guidance to a security control baseline. See Tailoring.

Tailoring

The process by which security control baselines are modified by:
(i) identifying and designating common controls; (ii) applying
scoping considerations on the applicability and implementation of
baseline controls; (iii) selecting compensating security controls;
(iv) assigning specific values to organization-defined security
control parameters; (v) supplementing baselines with additional
security controls or control enhancements; and (vi) providing
additional specification information for control implementation.

Threat

Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact
organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, or the Nation through an information system via
unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of
information, and/or denial of service.

[CNSSI 4009, Adapted]

Threat Assessment
[CNSSI 4009]

Threat Source
[FIPS 200]

Formal description and evaluation of threat to an information
system.
The intent and method targeted at the intentional exploitation of a
vulnerability or a situation and method that may accidentally
trigger a vulnerability. Synonymous with threat agent.

Trusted Path

A mechanism by which a user (through an input device) can
communicate directly with the security functions of the
information system with the necessary confidence to support the
system security policy. This mechanism can only be activated by
the user or the security functions of the information system and
cannot be imitated by untrusted software.

Trustworthiness

The attribute of a person or enterprise that provides confidence to
others of the qualifications, capabilities, and reliability of that
entity to perform specific tasks and fulfill assigned
responsibilities.

[CNSSI 4009]

Trustworthiness
(Information System)

APPENDIX B

The degree to which an information system (including the
information technology components that are used to build the
system) can be expected to preserve the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of the information being processed, stored, or
transmitted by the system across the full range of threats. A
trustworthy information system is a system that is believed to be
capable of operating within defined levels of risk despite the
environmental disruptions, human errors, structural failures, and
purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in its environment of
operation.

APPENDIX D

SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES – SUMMARY
LOW-IMPACT, MODERATE-IMPACT, AND HIGH-IMPACT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

T

his appendix contains the security control baselines that represent the starting point in
determining the security controls for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact
information systems. 90 The three security control baselines are hierarchical in nature with
regard to the security controls employed in those baselines. 91 If a security control is selected for
one of the baselines, the family identifier and control number are listed in the appropriate column.
If a security control is not used in a particular baseline, the entry is marked not selected. Security
control enhancements, when used to supplement security controls, are indicated by the number of
the enhancement. For example, an IR-2 (1) in the high baseline entry for the IR-2 security control
indicates that the second control from the Incident Response family has been selected along with
control enhancement (1). Some security controls and enhancements in the security control catalog
are not used in any of the baselines in this appendix but are available for use by organizations if
needed. This situation occurs, for example, when the results of a risk assessment indicate the need
for additional security controls or control enhancements in order to adequately mitigate risk to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
Organizations can use the recommended priority code designation associated with each security
control in the baselines to assist in making sequencing decisions for control implementation (i.e.,
a Priority Code 1 [P1] control has a higher priority for implementation than a Priority Code 2 [P2]
control; a Priority Code 2 [P2] control has a higher priority for implementation than a Priority
Code 3 [P3] control, and a Priority Code 0 [P0] indicates the security control is not selected in
any baseline). This recommended sequencing prioritization helps ensure that security controls
upon which other controls depend are implemented first, thus enabling organizations to deploy
controls in a more structured and timely manner in accordance with available resources. The
implementation of security controls by sequence priority code does not imply any defined level of
risk mitigation until all controls in the security plan have been implemented. The priority codes
are used only for implementation sequencing, not for making security control selection decisions.
Table D-1 summarizes sequence priority codes for the baseline security controls in Table D-2.
TABLE D-1: SECURITY CONTROL PRIORITIZATION CODES
Priority Code

Sequencing

Action

Priority Code 1 (P1)

FIRST

Implement P1 security controls first.

Priority Code 2 (P2)

NEXT

Implement P2 security controls after implementation of P1 controls.

Priority Code 3 (P3)

LAST

Implement P3 security controls after implementation of P1 and P2 controls.

Unspecified Priority Code (P0)

NONE

Security control not selected in any baseline.

90

A complete description of all security controls is provided in Appendices F and G. In addition, separate documents
for individual security control baselines (listed as Annexes 1, 2, and 3) are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications.
An online version of the catalog of security controls is also available at http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home.
91
The hierarchical nature applies to the security requirements of each control (i.e., the base control plus all of its
enhancements) at the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact level in that the control requirements at a
particular impact level (e.g., CP-4 Contingency Plan Testing—Moderate: CP-4 (1)) meets a stronger set of security
requirements for that control than the next lower impact level of the same control (e.g., CP-4 Contingency Plan
Testing—Low: CP-4).

Table D-2 provides a summary of the security controls and control enhancements from Appendix
F that have been allocated to the initial security control baselines (i.e., low, moderate, and high).
The sequence priority codes for security control implementation and those security controls that
have been withdrawn from Appendix F are also indicated in Table D-2. In addition to Table D-2,
the sequence priority codes and security control baselines are annotated in a priority and baseline
allocation summary section below each security control in Appendix F.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Tables D-3 through D-19 provide a more detailed summary of the security controls and control
enhancements in Appendix F. Each table focuses on a different security control family. Whereas
Table D-2 includes only those security controls and control enhancements allocated to the three
security control baselines, Tables D-3 through D-19 include all controls and enhancements for the
respective security control families. The tables include the following information: (i) the security
controls and control enhancements that have been selected for the security control baselines as
indicated by an “x” in the column for the selected baseline; 93 (ii) the security controls and control
enhancements that have not been selected for any security control baseline (i.e., the controls and
control enhancements available for selection to achieve greater protection) as indicated by blank
cells in the baseline columns; (iii) the security controls and control enhancements that have been
withdrawn from Appendix F as indicated by an “x” in the respective withdrawn column; and (iv)
the security controls and control enhancements that have assurance-related characteristics or
properties (i.e., assurance-related controls) as indicated by an “x” in the respective assurance
column. Assurance-related controls are discussed in greater detail in Appendix E to include the
allocation of such controls to security control baselines (see Tables E-1 through E-3). There is no
summary table provided for the Program Management (PM) family since PM controls are not
associated with any particular security control baseline.

ADJUSTMENTS TO SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES
ALLOCATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS AND ASSIGNMENT OF PRIORITY SEQUENCING CODES

With each revision to SP 800-53, minor adjustments may occur with the security control baselines
including, for example, allocating additional controls and/or control enhancements, eliminating
selected controls/enhancements, and changing sequencing priority codes (P-codes). These changes
reflect: (i) the ongoing receipt and analysis of threat information; (ii) the periodic reexamination of
the initial assumptions that generated the security control baselines; (iii) the desire for common
security control baseline starting points for national security and non-national security systems to
achieve community-wide convergence (relying subsequently on specific overlays to describe any
adjustments from the common starting points); and (iv) the periodic reassessment of priority codes
to appropriately balance the workload of security control implementation. Over time, as the security
control catalog expands to address the continuing challenges from a dynamic and growing threat
space that is increasingly sophisticated, organizations will come to rely to a much greater degree on
overlays to provide the needed specialization for their security plans.

ASSURANCE AND TRUSTWORTHINESS
MEASURES OF CONFIDENCE FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS

S

ecurity assurance is a critical aspect in determining the trustworthiness of information
systems. Assurance is the measure of confidence that the security functions, features,
practices, policies, procedures, mechanisms, and architecture of organizational information
systems accurately mediate and enforce established security policies.94 The objective of this
appendix is:
•

To encourage organizations to include assurance requirements in procurements of
information systems, system components, and services;

•

To encourage hardware, software, and firmware developers to employ development practices
that result in more trustworthy information technology products and systems;

•

To encourage organizations to identify, select, and use information technology products that
have been built with appropriate levels of assurance and to employ sound systems and
security engineering techniques and methods during the system development life cycle
process;

•

To reduce information security risk by deploying more trustworthy information technology
products within critical information systems or system components; and

•

To encourage developers and organizations to obtain on an ongoing basis, assurance evidence
for maintaining trustworthiness of information systems.

Minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems are defined in
FIPS Publication 200. These requirements can be satisfied by selecting, tailoring, implementing,
and obtaining assurance evidence for the security controls in the low, moderate, or high baselines
in Appendix D. 95 The baselines also include the assurance-related controls for the minimum
assurance requirements that are generally applicable to federal information and information
systems. 96 However, considering the current threat space and the increasing risk to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, posed by the advanced
persistent threat (APT), organizations may choose to implement additional assurance-related
controls from Appendix F. These additional controls can be selected based on the tailoring
guidance provided in Section 3.2. Organizations can also consider developing high-assurance
overlays for critical missions/business functions, specialized environments of operation, and/or
information technologies (see Section 3.3 and Appendix I). When assurance-related controls
cannot be satisfied, organizations can propose compensating controls (e.g., procedural/operational
94

Section 2.6 provides an introduction to the concepts of assurance and trustworthiness and how the two concepts are
related. A trustworthiness model is illustrated in Figure 3.
95
CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security control baselines for national security systems. Therefore, the assurancerelated controls in the baselines established for the national security community, if so designated, may differ from those
controls designated in Tables E-1 through E-3.
96

It is difficult to determine if a given security control baseline from Appendix D provides the assurance needed across
all information technologies, users, platforms, and organizations. For example, while the use of formal methods might
be appropriate in a cross-domain product, different assurance techniques might be appropriate for a complex air traffic
control system or for a web server providing emergency preparedness information from the Department of Homeland
Security. Still, the existing baselines do have assurance aspects that reflect the minimum assurance that is anticipated to
be common across all technologies, users, platforms, and organizations.

solutions to compensate for insufficient technology-based solutions) or assume a greater degree
of risk with regard to the actual security capability achieved.

The New Look for Assurance
While previous versions of Special Publication 800-53 addressed minimum assurance requirements,
the focus was on higher-level, more abstract requirements applied to the low, moderate, and high
baselines. This revision takes a fundamentally different approach to assurance by defining specific
assurance-related security controls in Appendix F that can be implemented by organizations based
on the security categorizations of their information systems—making the assurance requirements
more actionable and providing opportunities for increasing the levels of assurance based on mission
and business needs, current/projected threats, unique operating environments, or the use of new
technologies. The identification of specific assurance-related controls in the low, moderate, and high
baselines in easy-to read tables (Tables E-1, E-2, E-3) helps organizations to quickly define controls
necessary to satisfy minimum assurance requirements. The optional assurance-related controls in
Table E-4 provide organizations with specification language to use in acquisitions targeted at the
developers of information systems, system components, and information system services. The
controls address specific methodologies, techniques, design, and architectural considerations as
well as sound system and security engineering principles to fundamentally improve the quality of
hardware, software, and firmware components that will be integrated into organizational information
systems or the critical infrastructure. The designation of assurance-related controls is not intended to
imply a greater level of importance for such controls. Achieving adequate security for organizational
information systems requires the correct combination of both functionality- and assurance-related
security controls. Only by understanding the importance of the concept of assurance and recognizing
which security controls are more assurance-oriented versus functionality-oriented can organizations
select the most appropriate combination of controls to protect their organizational operations and
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

The following sections provide a description of the assurance-related controls that are included in
each of the security control baselines in Appendix D. The criteria for whether a security control is
assurance-related or functionality-related is based on the overall characteristics of the control. In
general, assurance-related controls are controls that: (i) define processes, procedures, techniques,
or methodologies for designing and developing information systems and system components (i.e.,
hardware, software, firmware); (ii) provide supporting operational processes including improving
the quality of systems/components/processes; (iii) produce security evidence from developmental
or operational activities; (iv) determine security control effectiveness or risk (e.g., audit, testing,
evaluation, analysis, assessment, verification, validation, monitoring); or (v) improve personnel
skills, expertise, and understanding (e.g., security awareness/training, incident response training,
contingency training).
Security controls may be designated as assurance-related controls even when the controls exhibit
some functional characteristics or properties (e.g., SI-4, Information System Monitoring). The
distinction between functionality and assurance is less important when describing the assurancerelated controls in the baselines—primarily because the security controls in the three baselines
after the tailoring process is applied, become part of the security plans for information systems
and for organizations.97 However, the distinction becomes more important when organizations
exercise the option of selecting additional security controls to increase the level of assurance (or
the degree of confidence) in the security functionality and security capability.
97
Organizations are cautioned to carefully examine the assurance-related controls in the baselines during the tailoring
process, including the development of overlays, to help ensure that controls are not being inadvertently eliminated that
provide the measures of confidence in the security functionality needed for mission/business protection.

Minimum Assurance Requirements – Low-Impact Systems
Assurance Requirement: The organization, based on its security requirements, security policies, and needed
security capabilities, has an expectation of: (i) a limited strength of security functionality; and (ii) a limited
degree of confidence supported by the depth and coverage of associated security evidence, that the security
functionality is complete, consistent, and correct.

Security functionality and assurance for low-impact systems are achieved by the
implementation of security controls from the tailored low baseline in Appendix D. Assurance requirements
for low-impact systems (including the information technology components that are part of those systems),
align with that which is readily achievable with unmodified, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products and
services. Due to the limited strength of functionality expected for low-impact systems, the depth/coverage
of security evidence 98 produced is minimal and is not expected to be more than what is routinely provided
by COTS manufacturers, vendors, and resellers. The depth/coverage evidence is further supplemented by
the results of security control assessments and the ongoing monitoring of organizational information
systems and environments in which the systems operate. For other than technology-based functionality, the
emphasis is on a limited degree of confidence in the completeness, correctness, and consistency of
procedural and/or operational security functionality (e.g., policies, procedures, physical security, and
personnel security). Assurance requirements specified in the form of developmental and operational
assurance controls for low-impact systems are listed in Table E-1. Organizations, through the tailoring
process (including an organizational assessment of risk), may choose to add other assurance-related
controls and/or control enhancements to the set included in Table E-1.

The assurance-related controls in Table E-1 are a subset of the security controls contained in the security control
baseline for low-impact systems in Appendix D. Implementing the assurance-related controls in Table E-1 (including
depth/coverage security evidence from NIST Special Publication 800-53A) will satisfy the minimum assurance
requirements for low-impact systems mandated by FIPS Publication 200.

Minimum Assurance Requirements – Moderate-Impact Systems
Assurance Requirement: The organization, based on its security requirements, security policies, and needed
security capabilities, has an expectation of: (i) a moderate strength of security functionality; and (ii) a
moderate degree of confidence supported by the depth and coverage of associated security evidence, that
the security functionality is complete, consistent, and correct.

Security functionality and assurance for moderate-impact systems are achieved by
the implementation of security controls from the tailored moderate baseline in Appendix D. Assurance
requirements for moderate-impact systems (including the information technology components that are part
of those systems) add to the expectations at the low-assurance level by: (i) incorporating COTS security
functionality with greater strength of mechanism and capability than the strength of mechanism and
capability achieved in low-impact systems; (ii) requiring perhaps, some special development; (iii)
establishing more secure configuration settings; and (iv) requiring some additional assessment of the
implemented capability. Due to the moderate strength of functionality expected for moderate-impact
systems, the depth/coverage of security evidence 100 produced is more substantial than the minimal evidence
produced for low-impact systems but still in the range of what can be provided by COTS manufacturers,
vendors, and resellers. The depth/coverage evidence is further supplemented by the results of additional
security control assessments and the ongoing monitoring of organizational information systems and
environments of operation. For other than technology-based functionality, the emphasis is on a moderate
degree of confidence in the completeness, correctness, and consistency of procedural and/or operational
security functionality (e.g., policies, procedures, physical security, and personnel security). Assurance
requirements in the form of developmental and operational assurance controls for moderate-impact systems
are listed in Table E-2. Organizations, through the tailoring process (including an organizational assessment
of risk), may choose to add other assurance-related controls and/or control enhancements to the set
included in Table E-2.

Minimum Assurance Requirements – High-Impact Systems
Assurance Requirement: The organization, based on its security requirements, security policies, and needed
security capabilities, has an expectation of: (i) a high strength of security functionality; and (ii) a high
degree of confidence supported by the depth and coverage of associated security evidence, that the security
functionality is complete, consistent, and correct.

Security functionality and assurance for high-impact systems are achieved by the
implementation of security controls from the tailored high baseline in Appendix D. Assurance requirements
for high-impact systems (including the information technology components that are part of those systems),
add to the expectations at the moderate assurance level by: (i) incorporating higher-end COTS security
capabilities that result from the application of commonly accepted best commercial development practices
for reducing latent flaw rates, some special development, and additional assessment of the implemented
capability. Due to the high strength of functionality expected for high-impact systems, the depth/coverage
of security evidence 102 produced is more comprehensive than the evidence produced for moderate-impact
systems. Although the evidence may still be in the range of what can be provided by COTS manufacturers,
vendors, and resellers, greater assurance from independent assessment providers may be required. The
depth/coverage evidence is supplemented by the results of additional security control assessments and the
ongoing monitoring of organizational information systems/environments of operation. For other than
technology-based functionality, there is a high degree of confidence in the completeness, correctness, and
consistency of procedural and/or operational security functionality (e.g., policies, procedures, physical
security, and personnel security). Assurance requirements in the form of developmental and operational
assurance controls for high-impact information systems are listed in Table E-3. Organizations, through the
tailoring process (including an organizational assessment of risk), may choose to add other assurancerelated controls and/or control enhancements to the set included in Table E-3.

Security Controls to Achieve Enhanced Assurance

While the assurance-related controls allocated to the low, moderate, and high baselines in the
previous sections, represent minimum assurance requirements, organizations can, over time,
choose to raise the level of assurance in their information systems—increasing the level of
trustworthiness accordingly. This is accomplished by adding assurance-related controls to the
controls in the baselines to increase both the strength of security functionality and degree of
confidence that the functionality is correct, complete, and consistent—making the functionality
highly resistant to penetration, tamper, or bypass. Security functionality that is highly resistant to
penetration, tamper, and bypass requires a significant work factor on the part of adversaries to
compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information system or system
components where that functionality is employed.
Since high-assurance information technology products may be more costly and difficult to obtain,
organizations may choose to partition their information systems into distinct subsystems to isolate
the critical components and focus the high-assurance efforts on a more narrowly defined subset of
information resources. Organizations that find it difficult to achieve high-assurance information
technology solutions may have to rely to a greater extent on procedural or operational protections
to ensure mission and business success. This includes, for example, reengineering critical mission
and business processes to be less susceptible to high-end threats. Table E-4 provides additional
developmental and operational activities (e.g., in the SA, SI, and CM security control families),
that organizations can select to achieve an enhanced level of assurance (up to and including high
assurance). The list of assurance-related controls is not intended to be exhaustive. Organizations,
during the tailoring process, may choose to designate other security controls as assurance-related
and add to the exemplar set in Table E-4.

APPENDIX F

SECURITY CONTROL CATALOG
SECURITY CONTROLS, ENHANCEMENTS, AND SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE

T

he catalog of security controls in this appendix provides a range of safeguards and
countermeasures for organizations and information systems. 105 The security controls have
been designed to facilitate compliance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. 106 The organization of the security
control catalog, the structure of the security controls, and the concept of allocating security
controls and control enhancements to the initial baselines in Appendix D are described in Chapter
Two. The security controls in the catalog with few exceptions, have been designed to be policyand technology-neutral. This means that security controls and control enhancements focus on the
fundamental safeguards and countermeasures necessary to protect information during processing,
while in storage, and during transmission. Therefore, it is beyond the scope of this publication to
provide guidance on the application of security controls to specific technologies, communities of
interest, environments of operation, or missions/business functions. These areas are addressed by
the use of the tailoring process described in Chapter Three and the development of overlays
described in Appendix I.
In the few cases where specific technologies are called out in security controls (e.g., mobile, PKI,
wireless, VOIP), organizations are cautioned that the need to provide adequate security goes well
beyond the requirements in a single control associated with a particular technology. Many of the
needed safeguards/countermeasures are obtained from the other security controls in the catalog
allocated to the initial control baselines as the starting point for the development of security plans
and overlays using the tailoring process. In addition to the organization-driven development of
specialized security plans and overlays, NIST Special Publications and Interagency Reports may
provide guidance on recommended security controls for specific technologies and sector-specific
applications (e.g., Smart Grid, healthcare, Industrial Control Systems, and mobile).
Employing a policy- and technology-neutral security control catalog has the following benefits:
•

It encourages organizations to focus on the security capabilities required for mission/business
success and the protection of information, irrespective of the information technologies that
are employed in organizational information systems;

•

It encourages organizations to analyze each security control for its applicability to specific
technologies, environments of operation, missions/business functions, and communities of
interest; and

105

An online version of the catalog of security controls is also available at http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home.

106
Compliance necessitates organizations executing due diligence with regard to information security and risk
management. Information security due diligence includes using all appropriate information as part of an organizationwide risk management program to effectively use the tailoring guidance and inherent flexibility in NIST publications so
that the selected security controls documented in organizational security plans meet the specific mission and business
requirements of organizations. Using the risk management tools and techniques that are available to organizations is
essential in developing, implementing, and maintaining the safeguards and countermeasures with the necessary and
sufficient strength of mechanism to address the current threats to organizational operations and assets, individuals,
other organizations, and the Nation. Employing effective risk-based processes, procedures, and technologies will help
ensure that all federal information systems and organizations have the necessary resilience to support ongoing federal
responsibilities, critical infrastructure applications, and continuity of government.

•

It encourages organizations to specify security policies as part of the tailoring process for
security controls that have variable parameters.

For example, organizations using smart phones, tablets, or other types of mobile devices would
start the tailoring process by assuming that all security controls and control enhancements in the
appropriate baseline (low, moderate, or high) are needed. The tailoring process may result in
certain security controls being eliminated for a variety of reasons, including, for example, the
inability of the technology to support the implementation of the control. However, the elimination
of such controls without understanding the potential adverse impacts to organizational missions
and business functions can significantly increase information security risk and should be carefully
analyzed. This type of analysis is essential in order for organizations to make effective risk-based
decisions including the selection of appropriate compensating security controls, when considering
the use of these emerging mobile devices and technologies. The specialization of security plans
using the tailoring guidance and overlays, together with a comprehensive set of technology- and
policy-neutral security controls, promotes cost-effective, risk-based information security for
organizations—in any sector, for any technology, and in any operating environment.
The security controls in the catalog are expected to change over time, as controls are withdrawn,
revised, and added. In order to maintain stability in security plans and automated tools supporting
the implementation of Special Publication 800-53, security controls will not be renumbered each
time a control is withdrawn. Rather, notations of security controls that have been withdrawn are
maintained in the catalog for historical purposes. Security controls are withdrawn for a variety of
reasons including, for example: the security capability provided by the withdrawn control has
been incorporated into another control; the security capability provided by the withdrawn control
is redundant to an existing control; or the security control is deemed to be no longer necessary.
There may, on occasion, be repetition in requirements that appear in the security controls and
control enhancements that are part of the security control catalog. This repetition in requirements
is intended to reinforce the security requirements from the perspective of multiple controls and/or
enhancements. For example, the requirement for strong identification and authentication when
conducting remote maintenance activities appears in the MA family in the specific context of
systems maintenance activities conducted by organizations. The identification and authentication
requirement also appears in a more general context in the IA family. While these requirements
appear to be redundant (i.e., overlapping), they are, in fact, mutually reinforcing and not intended
to require additional effort on the part of organizations in the development and implementation of
security programs.

Implementation Tip
New security controls and control enhancements will be developed on a regular basis using state-ofthe-practice information from national-level threat and vulnerability databases as well as information
on the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by adversaries in launching cyber attacks. The
proposed modifications to security controls and security control baselines will be carefully weighed
during each revision cycle, considering the desire for stability of the security control catalog and the
need to respond to changing threats, vulnerabilities, attack methods, and information technologies.
The overall objective is to raise the basic level of information security over time. Organizations may
choose to develop new security controls when there is a specific security capability required and the
appropriate controls are not available in Appendices F or G.

SECURITY CONTROL CLASS DESIGNATIONS
MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONAL, AND TECHNICAL REFERENCES

Because many security controls within the security control families in Appendix F have various
combinations of management, operational, and technical properties, the specific class designations
have been removed from the security control families. Organizations may still find it useful to
apply such designations to individual security controls and control enhancements or to individual
sections within a particular control/enhancement. Organizations may find it beneficial to employ
class designations as a way to group or refer to security controls. The class designations may also
help organizations with the process of allocating security controls and control enhancements to: (i)
responsible parties or information systems (e.g., as common or hybrid controls); (ii) specific roles;
and/or (iii) specific components of a system. For example, organizations may determine that the
responsibility for system-specific controls they have placed in the management class belong to the
information system owner, controls placed in the operational class belong to the Information
System Security Officer (ISSO), and controls placed in the technical class belong to one or more
system administrators. This example is provided to illustrate the potential usefulness of designating
classes for controls and/or control enhancements; it is not meant to suggest or require additional
tasks for organizations.

CAUTIONARY NOTE
DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, AND SERVICES

With the renewed emphasis on trustworthy information systems and supply chain security, it is
essential that organizations have the capability to express their information security requirements
with clarity and specificity in order to engage the information technology industry and obtain the
systems, components, and services necessary for mission and business success. To ensure that
organizations have such capability, Special Publication 800-53 provides a set of security controls in
the System and Services Acquisition family (i.e., SA family) addressing requirements for the
development of information systems, information technology products, and information system
services. Therefore, many of the controls in the SA family are directed at developers of those
systems, components, and services. It is important for organizations to recognize that the scope of
the security controls in the SA family includes all system/component/service development and the
developers associated with such development whether the development is conducted by internal
organizational personnel or by external developers through the contracting/acquisition process.
Affected controls include SA-8, SA-10, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-20, and SA-21.

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Fundamentals of the Catalog
Security controls and control enhancements in Appendices F and G are generally designed to be
policy-neutral and technology/implementation-independent. Organizations provide information
about security controls and control enhancements in two ways:
• By specifying security control implementation details (e.g., platform dependencies) in the
associated security plan for the information system or security program plan for the
organization; and
• By establishing specific values in the variable sections of selected security controls through the
use of assignment and selection statements.
Assignment and selection statements provide organizations with the capability to specialize
security controls and control enhancements based on organizational security requirements or
requirements originating in federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
standards, or guidelines. Organization-defined parameters used in assignment and selection
statements in the basic security controls apply also to all control enhancements associated with
those controls. Control enhancements strengthen the fundamental security capability in the base
control but are not a substitute for using assignment or selection statements to provide greater
specificity to the control. Assignment statements for security controls and control enhancements
do not contain minimum or maximum values (e.g., testing contingency plans at least annually).
Organizations should consult specific federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
policies, standards, or guidelines as the definitive sources for such information. The absence of
minimum and maximum values from the security controls and control enhancements does not
obviate the need for organizations to comply with requirements in the controlling source
publications.
The first security control in each family (i.e., the dash-1 control) generates requirements for
specific policies and procedures that are needed for the effective implementation of the other
security controls in the family. Therefore, individual controls and control enhancements in a
particular family do not call for the development of such policies and procedures. Supplemental
guidance sections of security controls and control enhancements do not contain any requirements
or references to FIPS or NIST Special Publications. NIST publications are, however, included in
a references section for each security control.
In support of the Joint Task Force initiative to develop a unified information security framework
for the federal government, security controls and control enhancements for national security
systems are included in this appendix. The inclusion of such controls and enhancements is not
intended to impose security requirements on organizations that operate national security systems.
Rather, organizations can use the security controls and control enhancements on a voluntary basis
with the approval of federal officials exercising policy authority over national security systems. In
addition, the security control priorities and security control baselines listed in Appendix D and in
the priority and baseline allocation summary boxes below each security control in Appendix F,
apply to non-national security systems only unless otherwise directed by the federal officials with
national security policy authority.

Using the Catalog
Organizations employ security controls 107 in federal information systems and the environments in
which those systems operate in accordance with FIPS Publication 199, FIPS Publication 200, and
NIST Special Publications 800-37 and 800-39. Security categorization of federal information and
information systems, as required by FIPS Publication 199, is the first step in the risk management
process. 108 Next, organizations select an appropriate set of security controls for their information
systems by satisfying the minimum security requirements set forth in FIPS Publication 200.
Appendix D includes three security control baselines that are associated with the designated
impact levels of information systems as determined during the security categorization process.109
After baseline selection, organizations tailor the baselines by: (i) identifying/designating common
controls; (ii) applying scoping considerations; (iii) selecting compensating controls, if needed;
(iv) assigning control parameter values in selection and assignment statements; (v) supplementing
the baseline controls with additional controls and control enhancements from the security control
catalog; and (vi) providing additional information for control implementation. Organizations can
also use the baseline tailoring process with the overlay concept that is described in Section 3.2
and Appendix I. Risk assessments, as described in NIST Special Publication 800-30, guide and
inform the security control selection process. 110

CAUTIONARY NOTE
USE OF CRYPTOGRAPHY

If cryptography is required for the protection of information based on the selection of security
controls in Appendix F and subsequently implemented by organizational information systems, the
cryptographic mechanisms comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. This includes, for NSA-approved cryptography to
protect classified information, FIPS-validated cryptography to protect unclassified information, and
NSA-approved and FIPS-compliant key management technologies and processes. Security controls
SC-12 and SC-13 provide specific information on the selection of appropriate cryptographic
mechanisms, including the strength of such mechanisms.

107

Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared,
group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and
service. Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by
organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information
system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security
controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system
accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner,
mission/business owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such
accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other
attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for
authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-oforigin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements
(e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time
zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to
consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency
accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a
part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without
the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in
response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency
account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary
accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used
for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such
accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions
for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or
temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated.
Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training. Related controls:

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED SYSTEM ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of information
system accounts.

The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT

The information system implements the following dynamic privilege management capabilities:
[Assignment: organization-defined list of dynamic privilege management capabilities].

In contrast to conventional access control approaches which employ
static information system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges, dynamic access
control approaches (e.g., service-oriented architectures) rely on run time access control
decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management. While user identities may remain
relatively constant over time, user privileges may change more frequently based on ongoing
mission/business requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege
management can include, for example, the immediate revocation of privileges from users, as
opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect any changes in
privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also refer to mechanisms that change the
privileges of users based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This
type of privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of privileges if
users are operating out of their normal work times, or if information systems are under duress
or in emergency maintenance situations. This control enhancement also includes the ancillary
effects of privilege changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for
communications. Dynamic privilege management can support requirements for information
system resiliency. Related control: AC-16.

Supplemental Guidance:

(7)

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | ROLE-BASED SCHEMES

The organization:
(a)

Establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a role-based access
scheme that organizes allowed information system access and privileges into roles;

(b) Monitors privileged role assignments; and
(c)

Takes [Assignment: organization-defined actions] when privileged role assignments are no
longer appropriate.

Supplemental Guidance: Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals
that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users
are not authorized to perform. These privileged roles include, for example, key management,
account management, network and system administration, database administration, and web
administration.
(8)

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC ACCOUNT CREATION

The information system creates [Assignment: organization-defined information system accounts]
dynamically.

Dynamic approaches for creating information system accounts (e.g., as
implemented within service-oriented architectures) rely on establishing accounts (identities) at

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF SHARED GROUPS / ACCOUNTS

The organization only permits the use of shared/group accounts that meet [Assignment:
organization-defined conditions for establishing shared/group accounts].
(10) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | SHARED / GROUP ACCOUNT CREDENTIAL TERMINATION
The information system terminates shared/group account credentials when members leave the
group.
(11) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | USAGE CONDITIONS
The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances and/or usage
conditions] for [Assignment: organization-defined information system accounts].

Organizations can describe the specific conditions or circumstances
under which information system accounts can be used, for example, by restricting usage to
certain days of the week, time of day, or specific durations of time.

Supplemental Guidance:

(12) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | ACCOUNT MONITORING / ATYPICAL USAGE
The organization:
(a)

Monitors information system accounts for [Assignment: organization-defined atypical use];
and

(b) Reports atypical usage of information system accounts to [Assignment: organization-defined
personnel or roles].

Atypical usage includes, for example, accessing information systems
at certain times of the day and from locations that are not consistent with the normal usage
patterns of individuals working in organizations. Related control: CA-7.

Supplemental Guidance:

(13) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DISABLE ACCOUNTS FOR HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS
The organization disables accounts of users posing a significant risk within [Assignment:

Users posing a significant risk to organizations include individuals for
whom reliable evidence or intelligence indicates either the intention to use authorized access
to information systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Harm
includes potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, or the Nation. Close coordination between authorizing officials, information
system administrators, and human resource managers is essential in order for timely execution
of this control enhancement. Related control: PS-4.

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT
Control: The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information
and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.
Supplemental Guidance: Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies,
attribute-based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access
control matrices, cryptography) control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or
processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records,
domains) in information systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the information
system level and recognizing that information systems can host many applications and services in
support of organizational missions and business operations, access enforcement mechanisms can

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-6].
(2)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | DUAL AUTHORIZATION

The information system enforces dual authorization for [Assignment: organization-defined
privileged commands and/or other organization-defined actions].

Dual authorization mechanisms require the approval of two authorized
individuals in order to execute. Organizations do not require dual authorization mechanisms
when immediate responses are necessary to ensure public and environmental safety. Related
controls: CP-9, MP-6.

Supplemental Guidance:

(3)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | MANDATORY ACCESS CONTROL
The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined mandatory access control
policies] over all subjects and objects where the policy specifies that:

(a)

The policy is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of the
information system;

(b) A subject that has been granted access to information is constrained from doing any of the
following;

(c)

(1)

Passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects;

(2)

Granting its privileges to other subjects;

(3)

Changing one or more security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or
information system components;

(4)

Choosing the security attributes and attribute values to be associated with newly created
or modified objects; or

(5)

Changing the rules governing access control; and

[Assignment: Organized-defined subjects] may explicitly be granted [Assignment:
organization-defined privileges (i.e., they are trusted subjects)] such that they are not limited
by some or all of the above constraints.

Mandatory access control as defined in this control enhancement is
synonymous with nondiscretionary access control, and is not constrained only to certain
historical uses (e.g., implementations using the Bell-LaPadula Model). The above class of
mandatory access control policies constrains what actions subjects can take with information
obtained from data objects for which they have already been granted access, thus preventing
the subjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. This class of
mandatory access control policies also constrains what actions subjects can take with respect
to the propagation of access control privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass
that privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects
to which the information system has control. Otherwise, the access control policy can be
circumvented. This enforcement typically is provided via an implementation that meets the
reference monitor concept (see AC-25). The policy is bounded by the information system
boundary (i.e., once the information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional
means may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information remain in effect). The
trusted subjects described above are granted privileges consistent with the concept of least
privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects are only given the minimum privileges relative to the
above policy necessary for satisfying organizational mission/business needs. The control is
most applicable when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or
regulation) that establishes a policy regarding access to sensitive/classified information and
some users of the information system are not authorized access to all sensitive/classified
information resident in the information system. This control can operate in conjunction with
AC-3 (4). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by this control is
still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4), but policies governed by
Supplemental Guidance:

APPENDIX F-AC

PAGE F-11

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

this control take precedence over the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4). For example,
while a mandatory access control policy imposes a constraint preventing a subject from
passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity label, AC-3 (4)
permits the subject to pass the information to any subject with the same sensitivity label as the
subject. Related controls: AC-25, SC-11.
(4)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | DISCRETIONARY ACCESS CONTROL

The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined discretionary access control
policies] over defined subjects and objects where the policy specifies that a subject that has been
granted access to information can do one or more of the following:
(a)

Pass the information to any other subjects or objects;

(b) Grant its privileges to other subjects;
(c)

Change security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or the information
system’s components;

(d) Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects; or
(e)

Change the rules governing access control.

When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects
are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they
have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information
are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information
to other subjects or objects. This control enhancement can operate in conjunction with AC-3
(3). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by AC-3 (3) is still able
to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this control enhancement. Thus, while AC-3
(3) imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject
operating at a different sensitivity level, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information
to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system
boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system,
additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While the
older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access
control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.

Supplemental Guidance:

(5)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY-RELEVANT INFORMATION

The information system prevents access to [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant
information] except during secure, non-operable system states.
Supplemental Guidance: Security-relevant information is any information within information
systems that can potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of
security services in a manner that could result in failure to enforce system security policies or
maintain the isolation of code and data. Security-relevant information includes, for example,
filtering rules for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information, configuration
parameters for security services, and access control lists. Secure, non-operable system states
include the times in which information systems are not performing mission/business-related
processing (e.g., the system is off-line for maintenance, troubleshooting, boot-up, shut down).
Related control: CM-3.
(6)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | PROTECTION OF USER AND SYSTEM INFORMATION

(7)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-4 and SC-28].
The information system enforces a role-based access control policy over defined subjects and
objects and controls access based upon [Assignment: organization-defined roles and users
authorized to assume such roles].

Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that
restricts information system access to authorized users. Organizations can create specific roles
based on job functions and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations
on organizational information systems associated with the organization-defined roles. When
users are assigned to the organizational roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges
defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations because

Supplemental Guidance:

APPENDIX F-AC

PAGE F-12

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a significant number of
individuals for mid- to large-size organizations) but are instead acquired through role
assignments. RBAC can be implemented either as a mandatory or discretionary form of
access control. For organizations implementing RBAC with mandatory access controls, the
requirements in AC-3 (3) define the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy.
(8)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | REVOCATION OF ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS

The information system enforces the revocation of access authorizations resulting from changes
to the security attributes of subjects and objects based on [Assignment: organization-defined rules
governing the timing of revocations of access authorizations].

Revocation of access rules may differ based on the types of access
revoked. For example, if a subject (i.e., user or process) is removed from a group, access may
not be revoked until the next time the object (e.g., file) is opened or until the next time the
subject attempts a new access to the object. Revocation based on changes to security labels
may take effect immediately. Organizations can provide alternative approaches on how to
make revocations immediate if information systems cannot provide such capability and
immediate revocation is necessary.
Supplemental Guidance:

(9)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | CONTROLLED RELEASE

The information system does not release information outside of the established system boundary
unless:
(a)

The receiving [Assignment: organization-defined information system or system component]
provides [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards]; and

(b) [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] are used to validate the
appropriateness of the information designated for release.

Information systems can only protect organizational information
within the confines of established system boundaries. Additional security safeguards may be
needed to ensure that such information is adequately protected once it is passed beyond the
established information system boundaries. Examples of information leaving the system
boundary include transmitting information to an external information system or printing the
information on one of its printers. In cases where the information system is unable to make a
determination of the adequacy of the protections provided by entities outside its boundary, as
a mitigating control, organizations determine procedurally whether the external information
systems are providing adequate security. The means used to determine the adequacy of the
security provided by external information systems include, for example, conducting
inspections or periodic testing, establishing agreements between the organization and its
counterpart organizations, or some other process. The means used by external entities to
protect the information received need not be the same as those used by the organization, but
the means employed are sufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security policy to
protect the information. This control enhancement requires information systems to employ
technical or procedural means to validate the information prior to releasing it to external
systems. For example, if the information system passes information to another system
controlled by another organization, technical means are employed to validate that the security
attributes associated with the exported information are appropriate for the receiving system.
Alternatively, if the information system passes information to a printer in organizationcontrolled space, procedural means can be employed to ensure that only appropriately
authorized individuals gain access to the printer. This control enhancement is most applicable
when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that
establishes policy regarding access to the information, and that policy applies beyond the
realm of a particular information system or organization.

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT

The information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of
information within the system and between interconnected systems based on [Assignment:
organization-defined information flow control policies].

Control:

Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel
within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to
access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information.
Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being
transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the
organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy
server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and
content. Transferring information between information systems representing different security
domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more
domain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at
designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider
mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies.
Enforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected
systems (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way
information flows; and (iii) implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security
attributes and security labels.
Supplemental Guidance:

Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms
to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks,
individuals, and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow
control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement
occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted
tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information
system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or messagefiltering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using
document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection
mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information
flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution
needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow
enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance
guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information
technology products. Related controls: AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, AC-21, CM-6, CM-7, SA-8, SC-2,

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | OBJECT SECURITY ATTRIBUTES

The information system uses [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] associated
with [Assignment: organization-defined information, source, and destination objects] to enforce
[Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies] as a basis for flow control
decisions.

Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security attributes
associated with information (data content and data structure) and source/destination objects,
and respond appropriately (e.g., block, quarantine, alert administrator) when the mechanisms
encounter information flows not explicitly allowed by information flow policies. For example,
an information object labeled Secret would be allowed to flow to a destination object labeled
Secret, but an information object labeled Top Secret would not be allowed to flow to a

destination object labeled Secret. Security attributes can also include, for example, source and
destination addresses employed in traffic filter firewalls. Flow enforcement using explicit
security attributes can be used, for example, to control the release of certain types of
information. Related control: AC-16.
(2)

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | PROCESSING DOMAINS

The information system uses protected processing domains to enforce [Assignment: organizationdefined information flow control policies] as a basis for flow control decisions.

Within information systems, protected processing domains are
processing spaces that have controlled interactions with other processing spaces, thus
enabling control of information flows between these spaces and to/from data/information
objects. A protected processing domain can be provided, for example, by implementing
domain and type enforcement. In domain and type enforcement, information system processes
are assigned to domains; information is identified by types; and information flows are
controlled based on allowed information accesses (determined by domain and type), allowed
signaling among domains, and allowed process transitions to other domains.

Supplemental Guidance:

(3)

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DYNAMIC INFORMATION FLOW CONTROL

The information system enforces dynamic information flow control based on [Assignment:
organization-defined policies].

Organizational policies regarding dynamic information flow control
include, for example, allowing or disallowing information flows based on changing conditions
or mission/operational considerations. Changing conditions include, for example, changes in
organizational risk tolerance due to changes in the immediacy of mission/business needs,
changes in the threat environment, and detection of potentially harmful or adverse events.

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | EMBEDDED DATA TYPES

The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined limitations] on embedding
data types within other data types.

Embedding data types within other data types may result in reduced
flow control effectiveness. Data type embedding includes, for example, inserting executable
files as objects within word processing files, inserting references or descriptive information
into a media file, and compressed or archived data types that may include multiple embedded
data types. Limitations on data type embedding consider the levels of embedding and prohibit
levels of data type embedding that are beyond the capability of the inspection tools.

Supplemental Guidance:

(6)

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | METADATA

The information system enforces information flow control based on [Assignment: organizationdefined metadata].
Supplemental Guidance: Metadata is information used to describe the characteristics of data.
Metadata can include structural metadata describing data structures (e.g., data format, syntax,
and semantics) or descriptive metadata describing data contents (e.g., age, location, telephone
number). Enforcing allowed information flows based on metadata enables simpler and more
effective flow control. Organizations consider the trustworthiness of metadata with regard to
data accuracy (i.e., knowledge that the metadata values are correct with respect to the data),
data integrity (i.e., protecting against unauthorized changes to metadata tags), and the binding
of metadata to the data payload (i.e., ensuring sufficiently strong binding techniques with
appropriate levels of assurance). Related controls: AC-16, SI-7.

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY POLICY FILTERS

The information system enforces information flow control using [Assignment: organization-defined
security policy filters] as a basis for flow control decisions for [Assignment: organization-defined
information flows].

Organization-defined security policy filters can address data structures
and content. For example, security policy filters for data structures can check for maximum
file lengths, maximum field sizes, and data/file types (for structured and unstructured data).
Security policy filters for data content can check for specific words (e.g., dirty/clean word
filters), enumerated values or data value ranges, and hidden content. Structured data permits
the interpretation of data content by applications. Unstructured data typically refers to digital
information without a particular data structure or with a data structure that does not facilitate
the development of rule sets to address the particular sensitivity of the information conveyed
by the data or the associated flow enforcement decisions. Unstructured data consists of: (i)
bitmap objects that are inherently non language-based (i.e., image, video, or audio files); and
(ii) textual objects that are based on written or printed languages (e.g., commercial off-theshelf word processing documents, spreadsheets, or emails). Organizations can implement
more than one security policy filter to meet information flow control objectives (e.g.,
employing clean word lists in conjunction with dirty word lists may help to reduce false
positives).

Supplemental Guidance:

(9)

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | HUMAN REVIEWS

The information system enforces the use of human reviews for [Assignment: organization-defined
information flows] under the following conditions: [Assignment: organization-defined conditions].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations define security policy filters for all situations where
automated flow control decisions are possible. When a fully automated flow control decision
is not possible, then a human review may be employed in lieu of, or as a complement to,
automated security policy filtering. Human reviews may also be employed as deemed
necessary by organizations.
(10) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ENABLE / DISABLE SECURITY POLICY FILTERS
The information system provides the capability for privileged administrators to enable/disable
[Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] under the following conditions:
[Assignment: organization-defined conditions].

For example, as allowed by the information system authorization,
administrators can enable security policy filters to accommodate approved data types.

Supplemental Guidance:

(11) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | CONFIGURATION OF SECURITY POLICY FILTERS
The information system provides the capability for privileged administrators to configure
[Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] to support different security policies.

For example, to reflect changes in security policies, administrators can
change the list of “dirty words” that security policy mechanisms check in accordance with the
definitions provided by organizations.

Supplemental Guidance:

(12) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DATA TYPE IDENTIFIERS
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, uses
[Assignment: organization-defined data type identifiers] to validate data essential for information
flow decisions.

Data type identifiers include, for example, filenames, file types, file
signatures/tokens, and multiple internal file signatures/tokens. Information systems may allow
transfer of data only if compliant with data type format specifications.

Supplemental Guidance:

(13) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DECOMPOSITION INTO POLICY-RELEVANT SUBCOMPONENTS
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,
decomposes information into [Assignment: organization-defined policy-relevant subcomponents]
for submission to policy enforcement mechanisms.

Policy enforcement mechanisms apply filtering, inspection, and/or
sanitization rules to the policy-relevant subcomponents of information to facilitate flow
enforcement prior to transferring such information to different security domains. Parsing
transfer files facilitates policy decisions on source, destination, certificates, classification,
attachments, and other security-related component differentiators.

(14) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY POLICY FILTER CONSTRAINTS
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,
implements [Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] requiring fully enumerated
formats that restrict data structure and content.

Data structure and content restrictions reduce the range of potential
malicious and/or unsanctioned content in cross-domain transactions. Security policy filters
that restrict data structures include, for example, restricting file sizes and field lengths. Data
content policy filters include, for example: (i) encoding formats for character sets (e.g.,
Universal Character Set Transformation Formats, American Standard Code for Information
Interchange); (ii) restricting character data fields to only contain alpha-numeric characters;
(iii) prohibiting special characters; and (iv) validating schema structures.
Supplemental Guidance:

(15) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DETECTION OF UNSANCTIONED INFORMATION
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,
examines the information for the presence of [Assignment: organized-defined unsanctioned
information] and prohibits the transfer of such information in accordance with the [Assignment:
organization-defined security policy].

Detection of unsanctioned information includes, for example, checking
all information to be transferred for malicious code and dirty words. Related control: SI-3.

Supplemental Guidance:

(16) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | INFORMATION TRANSFERS ON INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-4].
(17) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DOMAIN AUTHENTICATION
The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates source and destination points by
[Selection (one or more): organization, system, application, individual] for information transfer.

Attribution is a critical component of a security concept of operations.
The ability to identify source and destination points for information flowing in information
systems, allows the forensic reconstruction of events when required, and encourages policy
compliance by attributing policy violations to specific organizations/individuals. Successful
domain authentication requires that information system labels distinguish among systems,
organizations, and individuals involved in preparing, sending, receiving, or disseminating
information. Related controls: IA-2, IA-3, IA-4, IA-5.

Supplemental Guidance:

(18) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY ATTRIBUTE BINDING
The information system binds security attributes to information using [Assignment: organizationdefined binding techniques] to facilitate information flow policy enforcement.

Binding techniques implemented by information systems affect the
strength of security attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance
associated with binding techniques play an important part in the trust organizations have in
the information flow enforcement process. The binding techniques affect the number and
degree of additional reviews required by organizations. Related controls: AC-16, SC-16.

Supplemental Guidance:

(19) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | VALIDATION OF METADATA
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, applies
the same security policy filtering to metadata as it applies to data payloads.

This control enhancement requires the validation of metadata and the
data to which the metadata applies. Some organizations distinguish between metadata and
data payloads (i.e., only the data to which the metadata is bound). Other organizations do not
make such distinctions, considering metadata and the data to which the metadata applies as
part of the payload. All information (including metadata and the data to which the metadata
applies) is subject to filtering and inspection.

Supplemental Guidance:

(20) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | APPROVED SOLUTIONS
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined solutions in approved
configurations] to control the flow of [Assignment: organization-defined information] across
security domains.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations define approved solutions and configurations in crossdomain policies and guidance in accordance with the types of information flows across

classification boundaries. The Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO)
provides a baseline listing of approved cross-domain solutions.
(21) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | PHYSICAL / LOGICAL SEPARATION OF INFORMATION FLOWS
The information system separates information flows logically or physically using [Assignment:
organization-defined mechanisms and/or techniques] to accomplish [Assignment: organizationdefined required separations by types of information].

Enforcing the separation of information flows by type can enhance
protection by ensuring that information is not commingled while in transit and by enabling
flow control by transmission paths perhaps not otherwise achievable. Types of separable
information include, for example, inbound and outbound communications traffic, service
requests and responses, and information of differing security categories.

Supplemental Guidance:

(22) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ACCESS ONLY
The information system provides access from a single device to computing platforms,
applications, or data residing on multiple different security domains, while preventing any
information flow between the different security domains.

The information system, for example, provides a desktop for users to
access each connected security domain without providing any mechanisms to allow transfer
of information between the different security domains.

Supplemental Guidance: Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized
privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of
duties includes, for example: (i) dividing mission functions and information system support
functions among different individuals and/or roles; (ii) conducting information system support
functions with different individuals (e.g., system management, programming, configuration
management, quality assurance and testing, and network security); and (iii) ensuring security

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and information
systems. The principle of least privilege is also applied to information system processes, ensuring
that the processes operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required
organizational missions/business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional
processes, roles, and information system accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege.
Organizations also apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of
organizational information systems. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, CM-6, CM-7, PL-2.

Supplemental Guidance:

Control Enhancements:
(1)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | AUTHORIZE ACCESS TO SECURITY FUNCTIONS

The organization explicitly authorizes access to [Assignment: organization-defined security
functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) and security-relevant information].

Security functions include, for example, establishing system accounts,
configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited,
and setting intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes, for
example, filtering rules for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information,
configuration parameters for security services, and access control lists. Explicitly authorized
personnel include, for example, security administrators, system and network administrators,
system security officers, system maintenance personnel, system programmers, and other
privileged users. Related controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19.

Supplemental Guidance:

(2)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | NON-PRIVILEGED ACCESS FOR NONSECURITY FUNCTIONS

The organization requires that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to
[Assignment: organization-defined security functions or security-relevant information], use nonprivileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.

This control enhancement limits exposure when operating from within
privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations
implement access control policies such as role-based access control and where a change of
role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the
user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between
a privileged and non-privileged account. Related control: PL-4.

Supplemental Guidance:

(3)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED COMMANDS

The organization authorizes network access to [Assignment: organization-defined privileged
commands] only for [Assignment: organization-defined compelling operational needs] and
documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system.

Network access is any access across a network connection in lieu of
local access (i.e., user being physically present at the device). Related control: AC-17.

Supplemental Guidance:
(4)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | SEPARATE PROCESSING DOMAINS

The information system provides separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation
of user privileges.

Providing separate processing domains for finer-grained allocation of
user privileges includes, for example: (i) using virtualization techniques to allow additional
privileges within a virtual machine while restricting privileges to other virtual machines or to
the underlying actual machine; (ii) employing hardware and/or software domain separation
mechanisms; and (iii) implementing separate physical domains. Related controls: AC-4, SC-3,
SC-30, SC-32.

Supplemental Guidance:

(5)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS

The organization restricts privileged accounts on the information system to [Assignment:
organization-defined personnel or roles].

Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically
described as system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating
systems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day
users from having access to privileged information/functions. Organizations may differentiate
in the application of this control enhancement between allowed privileges for local accounts
and for domain accounts provided organizations retain the ability to control information

LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGED ACCESS BY NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS

The organization prohibits privileged access to the information system by non-organizational
users.
Supplemental Guidance:
(7)

Related control: IA-8.

LEAST PRIVILEGE | REVIEW OF USER PRIVILEGES

The organization:
(a)

Reviews [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] the privileges assigned to
[Assignment: organization-defined roles or classes of users] to validate the need for such
privileges; and

(b) Reassigns or removes privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational
mission/business needs.

The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time
reflecting changes in organizational missions/business function, environments of operation,
technologies, or threat. Periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if
the rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated,
organizations take appropriate corrective actions. Related control: CA-7.
Supplemental Guidance:

(8)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGE LEVELS FOR CODE EXECUTION

The information system prevents [Assignment: organization-defined software] from executing at
higher privilege levels than users executing the software.

In certain situations, software applications/programs need to execute
with elevated privileges to perform required functions. However, if the privileges required for
execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking
such applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater privileges than
assigned by organizations.

Supplemental Guidance:

(9)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | AUDITING USE OF PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS

The information system audits the execution of privileged functions.

Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally
by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information
system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts
on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse,
and in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat
(APT). Related control: AU-2.

Supplemental Guidance:

(10) LEAST PRIVILEGE | PROHIBIT NON-PRIVILEGED USERS FROM EXECUTING PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS
The information system prevents non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to
include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.

Privileged functions include, for example, establishing information
system accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key
management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate
authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious
code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from
non-privileged users.

UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS
Control:

The information system:

a.

Enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive invalid logon
attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and

b.

Automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for an [Assignment: organization-defined

prompt according to [Assignment: organization-defined delay algorithm]] when the
maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.

Supplemental Guidance: This control applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or
network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by
information systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time
period established by organizations. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may choose to
employ different algorithms for different information system components based on the capabilities
of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at both the
operating system and the application levels. Related controls: AC-2, AC-9, AC-14, IA-5.

attempts.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies only to mobile devices for which a
logon occurs (e.g., personal digital assistants, smart phones, tablets). The logon is to the
mobile device, not to any one account on the device. Therefore, successful logons to any
accounts on mobile devices reset the unsuccessful logon count to zero. Organizations define
information to be purged/wiped carefully in order to avoid over purging/wiping which may
result in devices becoming unusable. Purging/wiping may be unnecessary if the information
on the device is protected with sufficiently strong encryption mechanisms. Related controls:

Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in
contrast to SC-10 which addresses the termination of network connections that are associated with
communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and
remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an
organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user
access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination terminates all processes
associated with a user’s logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the
user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events
requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of
user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, time-of-day restrictions on
information system use. Related controls: SC-10, SC-23.

Information resources to which users gain access via authentication
include, for example, local workstations, databases, and password-protected websites/webbased services. Logout messages for web page access, for example, can be displayed after
authenticated sessions have been terminated. However, for some types of interactive sessions
including, for example, file transfer protocol (FTP) sessions, information systems typically

may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication including, for
example, when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal information
systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received.
Organizations also identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but may
under certain circumstances (e.g., emergencies), allow identification or authentication mechanisms
to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch
that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored
use. This control does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already
occurred and are not repeated, but rather to situations where identification and authentication have
not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on
organizational information systems without identification and authentication and thus, the values
for assignment statements can be none. Related controls: CP-2, IA-2.

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES
Control:

The organization:

information in storage, in process, and/or in transmission;

b.

Ensures that the security attribute associations are made and retained with the information;

c.

Establishes the permitted [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] for
[Assignment: organization-defined information systems]; and

d.

Determines the permitted [Assignment: organization-defined values or ranges] for each of the
established security attributes.

Supplemental Guidance: Information is represented internally within information systems using
abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of
entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated
with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known
as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, interprocess pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions
representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to
safeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects)
that have the potential to send or receive information, to cause information to flow among objects,

APPENDIX F-AC

PAGE F-25

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

or to change the information system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive
entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of security attributes to
subjects and objects is referred to as binding and is typically inclusive of setting the attribute value
and the attribute type. Security attributes when bound to data/information, enables the enforcement
of information security policies for access control and information flow control, either through
organizational processes or information system functions or mechanisms. The content or assigned
values of security attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational
information.
Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected information systems to support
missions/business functions. There is potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to
any given security attribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or
NOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and
values, organizations can ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful and relevant. The
term security labeling refers to the association of security attributes with subjects and objects
represented by internal data structures within organizational information systems, to enable
information system-based enforcement of information security policies. Security labels include,
for example, access authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration),
nationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification of information in accordance with legal and
compliance requirements. The term security marking refers to the association of security attributes
with objects in a human-readable form, to enable organizational process-based enforcement of
information security policies. The AC-16 base control represents the requirement for user-based
attribute association (marking). The enhancements to AC-16 represent additional requirements
including information system-based attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes include,
for example, classification level for objects and clearance (access authorization) level for subjects.
An example of a value for both of these attribute types is Top Secret. Related controls: AC-3, AC4, AC-6, AC-21, AU-2, AU-10, SC-16, MP-3.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | DYNAMIC ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATION

The information system dynamically associates security attributes with [Assignment: organizationdefined subjects and objects] in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined security
policies] as information is created and combined.

Dynamic association of security attributes is appropriate whenever the
security characteristics of information changes over time. Security attributes may change, for
example, due to information aggregation issues (i.e., the security characteristics of individual
information elements are different from the combined elements), changes in individual access
authorizations (i.e., privileges), and changes in the security category of information. Related
control: AC-4.

Supplemental Guidance:

(2)

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE VALUE CHANGES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS

The information system provides authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of
individuals) the capability to define or change the value of associated security attributes.
Supplemental Guidance: The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly affect
the ability of individuals to access organizational information. Therefore, it is important for
information systems to be able to limit the ability to create or modify security attributes to
authorized individuals. Related controls: AC-6, AU-2.
(3)

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | MAINTENANCE OF ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATIONS BY INFORMATION SYSTEM

The information system maintains the association and integrity of [Assignment: organizationdefined security attributes] to [Assignment: organization-defined subjects and objects].

Maintaining the association and integrity of security attributes to
subjects and objects with sufficient assurance helps to ensure that the attribute associations
can be used as the basis of automated policy actions. Automated policy actions include, for
example, access control decisions or information flow control decisions.

The support provided by information systems can vary to include: (i)
prompting users to select specific security attributes to be associated with specific information
objects; (ii) employing automated mechanisms for categorizing information with appropriate
attributes based on defined policies; or (iii) ensuring that the combination of selected security
attributes selected is valid. Organizations consider the creation, deletion, or modification of
security attributes when defining auditable events.

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE DISPLAYS FOR OUTPUT DEVICES

The information system displays security attributes in human-readable form on each object that
the system transmits to output devices to identify [Assignment: organization-identified special
dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions] using [Assignment: organization-identified
human-readable, standard naming conventions].

Information system outputs include, for example, pages, screens, or
equivalent. Information system output devices include, for example, printers and video
displays on computer workstations, notebook computers, and personal digital assistants.

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | MAINTENANCE OF ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATION BY ORGANIZATION

The organization allows personnel to associate, and maintain the association of [Assignment:
organization-defined security attributes] with [Assignment: organization-defined subjects and
objects] in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined security policies].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires individual users (as opposed to the
information system) to maintain associations of security attributes with subjects and objects.
(7)

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | CONSISTENT ATTRIBUTE INTERPRETATION
The organization provides a consistent interpretation of security attributes transmitted between
distributed information system components.

In order to enforce security policies across multiple components in
distributed information systems (e.g., distributed database management systems, cloud-based
systems, and service-oriented architectures), organizations provide a consistent interpretation
of security attributes that are used in access enforcement and flow enforcement decisions.
Organizations establish agreements and processes to ensure that all distributed information
system components implement security attributes with consistent interpretations in automated
access/flow enforcement actions.

Supplemental Guidance:

(8)

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ASSOCIATION TECHNIQUES / TECHNOLOGIES

The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or
technologies] with [Assignment: organization-defined level of assurance] in associating security
attributes to information.

The association (i.e., binding) of security attributes to information
within information systems is of significant importance with regard to conducting automated
access enforcement and flow enforcement actions. The association of such security attributes
can be accomplished with technologies/techniques providing different levels of assurance. For
example, information systems can cryptographically bind security attributes to information
using digital signatures with the supporting cryptographic keys protected by hardware devices
(sometimes known as hardware roots of trust).
Supplemental Guidance:

(9)

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE REASSIGNMENT

The organization ensures that security attributes associated with information are reassigned only
via re-grading mechanisms validated using [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or
procedures].

Validated re-grading mechanisms are employed by organizations to
provide the requisite levels of assurance for security attribute reassignment activities. The
validation is facilitated by ensuring that re-grading mechanisms are single purpose and of
limited function. Since security attribute reassignments can affect security policy enforcement
actions (e.g., access/flow enforcement decisions), using trustworthy re-grading mechanisms is
necessary to ensure that such mechanisms perform in a consistent/correct mode of operation.

(10) SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE CONFIGURATION BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS
The information system provides authorized individuals the capability to define or change the type
and value of security attributes available for association with subjects and objects.

The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly affect
the ability of individuals to access organizational information. Therefore, it is important for
information systems to be able to limit the ability to create or modify security attributes to
authorized individuals only.

REMOTE ACCESS
Control:

The organization:

a.

Establishes and documents usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and
implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and

b.

Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.

Remote access is access to organizational information systems by users (or
processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet).
Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations
often employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity
over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote;
however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g.,
employing appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality and integrity protection) may
provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as
internal networks. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN
does not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with encrypted tunnels can
affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for
malicious code. Remote access controls apply to information systems other than public web
servers or systems designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to
allowing remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization. While organizations
may use interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such
agreements are not required by this control. Enforcing access restrictions for remote connections is
addressed in AC-3. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20, CA-3, CA-7, CM-8,

The organization selects radio antennas and calibrates transmission power levels to reduce the
probability that usable signals can be received outside of organization-controlled boundaries.

Actions that may be taken by organizations to limit unauthorized use
of wireless communications outside of organization-controlled boundaries include, for
example: (i) reducing the power of wireless transmissions so that the transmissions are less
likely to emit a signal that can be used by adversaries outside of the physical perimeters of
organizations; (ii) employing measures such as TEMPEST to control wireless emanations;
and (iii) using directional/beam forming antennas that reduce the likelihood that unintended
receivers will be able to intercept signals. Prior to taking such actions, organizations can
conduct periodic wireless surveys to understand the radio frequency profile of organizational
information systems as well as other systems that may be operating in the area. Related

ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES
Control:

The organization:

a.

Establishes usage restrictions, configuration requirements, connection requirements, and
implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices; and

b.

Authorizes the connection of mobile devices to organizational information systems.

A mobile device is a computing device that: (i) has a small form factor
such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate without a
physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information); (iii) possesses local, nonremovable or removable data storage; and (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile
devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device
to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations.
Examples include smart phones, E-readers, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated
with a single individual and the device is usually in close proximity to the individual; however, the
degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size of the device. The

processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or
merely a subset of desktop systems, depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the
device. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and
capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices.
Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example,
configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory
protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code,
updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting
primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling
unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Organizations are cautioned that the need to
provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many
safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in other security controls in the
catalog allocated in the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security
plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some degree of overlap in the
requirements articulated by the security controls within the different families of controls. AC-20

USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS

The organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust relationships
established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external information
systems, allowing authorized individuals to:

Control:

a.

Access the information system from external information systems; and

b.

Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external information
systems.

External information systems are information systems or components of
information systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established by organizations
and for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application
of required security controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External information
systems include, for example: (i) personally owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook
computers, smart phones, tablets, personal digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and
communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations,
convention centers, shopping malls, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or controlled by
nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information systems that are not owned
by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of organizations. This control also
addresses the use of external information systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of
organizational information, including, for example, accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as
a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational information systems.

Supplemental Guidance:

For some external information systems (i.e., information systems operated by other federal
agencies, including organizations subordinate to those agencies), the trust relationships that have
been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that
no explicit terms and conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations
would not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing
sharing/trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies or
organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by
applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals include, for
example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to
organizational information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose
rules of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on
authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon the
trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different
security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.
This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces
to organizational information systems (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through
www.usa.gov). Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external information
systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions
address as a minimum: types of applications that can be accessed on organizational information
systems from external information systems; and the highest security category of information that
can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external information systems. If terms and conditions
with the owners of external information systems cannot be established, organizations may impose
restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems. Related controls: AC-3, AC17, AC-19, CA-3, PL-4, SA-9.

USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | LIMITS ON AUTHORIZED USE
The organization permits authorized individuals to use an external information system to access
the information system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only
when the organization:

(a)

Verifies the implementation of required security controls on the external system as specified
in the organization’s information security policy and security plan; or

(b) Retains approved information system connection or processing agreements with the
organizational entity hosting the external information system.

This control enhancement recognizes that there are circumstances
where individuals using external information systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners)
need to access organizational information systems. In those situations, organizations need
confidence that the external information systems contain the necessary security safeguards
(i.e., security controls), so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational
information systems. Verification that the required security controls have been implemented
can be achieved, for example, by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other
means, depending on the confidence level required by organizations. Related control: CA-2.

Supplemental Guidance:

USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | PORTABLE STORAGE DEVICES
The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of organization-controlled portable
storage devices by authorized individuals on external information systems.

Supplemental Guidance: Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices
in external information systems include, for example, complete prohibition of the use of such
devices or restrictions on how the devices may be used and under what conditions the devices
may be used.
(3)

USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | NON-ORGANIZATIONALLY OWNED SYSTEMS / COMPONENTS / DEVICES
The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of non-organizationally owned information
systems, system components, or devices to process, store, or transmit organizational information.

Non-organizationally owned devices include devices owned by other
organizations (e.g., federal/state agencies, contractors) and personally owned devices. There
are risks to using non-organizationally owned devices. In some cases, the risk is sufficiently
high as to prohibit such use. In other cases, it may be such that the use of non-organizationally
owned devices is allowed but restricted in some way. Restrictions include, for example: (i)
requiring the implementation of organization-approved security controls prior to authorizing
such connections; (ii) limiting access to certain types of information, services, or applications;
(iii) using virtualization techniques to limit processing and storage activities to servers or
other system components provisioned by the organization; and (iv) agreeing to terms and
conditions for usage. For personally owned devices, organizations consult with the Office of
the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with using such devices in operational
environments, including, for example, requirements for conducting forensic analyses during
investigations after an incident.

Access control decisions (also known as authorization decisions) occur
when authorization information is applied to specific accesses. In contrast, access enforcement
occurs when information systems enforce access control decisions. While it is very common to
have access control decisions and access enforcement implemented by the same entity, it is not
required and it is not always an optimal implementation choice. For some architectures and
distributed information systems, different entities may perform access control decisions and access
enforcement.

ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS | TRANSMIT ACCESS AUTHORIZATION INFORMATION

The information system transmits [Assignment: organization-defined access authorization
information] using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to [Assignment:
organization-defined information systems] that enforce access control decisions.
Supplemental Guidance: In distributed information systems, authorization processes and access
control decisions may occur in separate parts of the systems. In such instances, authorization
information is transmitted securely so timely access control decisions can be enforced at the
appropriate locations. To support the access control decisions, it may be necessary to transmit
as part of the access authorization information, supporting security attributes. This is due to
the fact that in distributed information systems, there are various access control decisions that
need to be made and different entities (e.g., services) make these decisions in a serial fashion,
each requiring some security attributes to make the decisions. Protecting access authorization

(2)

ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS | NO USER OR PROCESS IDENTITY
The information system enforces access control decisions based on [Assignment: organizationdefined security attributes] that do not include the identity of the user or process acting on behalf
of the user.

In certain situations, it is important that access control decisions can be
made without information regarding the identity of the users issuing the requests. These are
generally instances where preserving individual privacy is of paramount importance. In other
situations, user identification information is simply not needed for access control decisions
and, especially in the case of distributed information systems, transmitting such information
with the needed degree of assurance may be very expensive or difficult to accomplish.

REFERENCE MONITOR
Control: The information system implements a reference monitor for [Assignment: organizationdefined access control policies] that is tamperproof, always invoked, and small enough to be
subject to analysis and testing, the completeness of which can be assured.
Supplemental Guidance: Information is represented internally within information systems using
abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of
entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated
with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known
as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, interprocess pipes, and communications ports. Reference monitors typically enforce mandatory access
control policies—a type of access control that restricts access to objects based on the identity of
subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The access controls are mandatory because
subjects with certain privileges (i.e., access permissions) are restricted from passing those
privileges on to any other subjects, either directly or indirectly—that is, the information system
strictly enforces the access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The
tamperproof property of the reference monitor prevents adversaries from compromising the
functioning of the mechanism. The always invoked property prevents adversaries from bypassing
the mechanism and hence violating the security policy. The smallness property helps to ensure the
completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect weaknesses or deficiencies
(i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the security policy. Related controls: AC3, AC-16, SC-3, SC-39.

SECURITY TRAINING | SUSPICIOUS COMMUNICATIONS AND ANOMALOUS SYSTEM BEHAVIOR

The organization provides training to its personnel on [Assignment: organization-defined
indicators of malicious code] to recognize suspicious communications and anomalous behavior in
organizational information systems.

A well-trained workforce provides another organizational safeguard
that can be employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect organizations against
malicious code coming in to organizations via email or the web applications. Personnel are
trained to look for indications of potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an unexpected
email, receiving an email containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving an email from an
unfamiliar sender but who appears to be from a known sponsor or contractor). Personnel are
also trained on how to respond to such suspicious email or web communications (e.g., not
opening attachments, not clicking on embedded web links, and checking the source of email
addresses). For this process to work effectively, all organizational personnel are trained and
made aware of what constitutes suspicious communications. Training personnel on how to
recognize anomalous behaviors in organizational information systems can potentially provide
early warning for the presence of malicious code. Recognition of such anomalous behavior by
organizational personnel can supplement automated malicious code detection and protection
tools and systems employed by organizations.

An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information
system. Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and relevant to

Supplemental Guidance:

APPENDIX F-AU

PAGE F-41

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems

________________________________________________________________________________________________

the security of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate in order
to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit events can include, for example, password
changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege
usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable
events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be
implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control
also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time.
For example, organizations may determine that information systems must have the capability to
log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for
specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements,
including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and control
enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required by applicable federal
laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records can be
generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the
network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and
can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition
of auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed,
transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and
actions that occur in service-oriented architectures. Related controls: AC-6, AC-17, AU-3, AU-12,

The information system generates audit records containing the following additional information:
[Assignment: organization-defined additional, more detailed information].

Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records
includes, for example, full text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities
of group account users. Organizations consider limiting the additional audit information to
only that information explicitly needed for specific audit requirements. This facilitates the use
of audit trails and audit logs by not including information that could potentially be misleading
or could make it more difficult to locate information of interest.

Off-loading is a process designed to preserve the confidentiality and
integrity of audit records by moving the records from the primary information system to a
secondary or alternate system. It is a common process in information systems with limited
audit storage capacity; the audit storage is used only in a transitory fashion until the system
can communicate with the secondary or alternate system designated for storing the audit
records, at which point the information is transferred.

Supplemental Guidance: Audit processing failures include, for example, software/hardware errors,
failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.
Organizations may choose to define additional actions for different audit processing failures (e.g.,
by type, by location, by severity, or a combination of such factors). This control applies to each
audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit records are
stored), the total audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories
combined), or both. Related controls: AU-4, SI-12.

The information system provides a warning to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel, roles,
and/or locations] within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when allocated audit
record storage volume reaches [Assignment: organization-defined percentage] of repository
maximum audit record storage capacity.

Organizations may have multiple audit data storage repositories

failure events occur: [Assignment: organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time
alerts].

Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts
provide these messages at information technology speed (i.e., the time from event detection to
alert occurs in seconds or less).

Supplemental Guidance:

(3)

RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | CONFIGURABLE TRAFFIC VOLUME THRESHOLDS

The information system enforces configurable network communications traffic volume thresholds
reflecting limits on auditing capacity and [Selection: rejects; delays] network traffic above those
thresholds.

Organizations have the capability to reject or delay the processing of
network communications traffic if auditing such traffic is determined to exceed the storage
capacity of the information system audit function. The rejection or delay response is triggered
by the established organizational traffic volume thresholds which can be adjusted based on
changes to audit storage capacity.

RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | SHUTDOWN ON FAILURE

The information system invokes a [Selection: full system shutdown; partial system shutdown;
degraded operational mode with limited mission/business functionality available] in the event of
[Assignment: organization-defined audit failures], unless an alternate audit capability exists.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations determine the types of audit failures that can trigger
automatic information system shutdowns or degraded operations. Because of the importance
of ensuring mission/business continuity, organizations may determine that the nature of the
audit failure is not so severe that it warrants a complete shutdown of the information system
supporting the core organizational missions/business operations. In those instances, partial
information system shutdowns or operating in a degraded mode with reduced capability may
be viable alternatives. Related control: AU-15.

enhance the ability to identify inappropriate or unusual activity.

APPENDIX F-AU

PAGE F-45

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement does not require vulnerability scanning, the
generation of performance data, or information system monitoring. Rather, the enhancement
requires that the analysis of information being otherwise produced in these areas is integrated
with the analysis of audit information. Security Event and Information Management System
tools can facilitate audit record aggregation/consolidation from multiple information system
components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of standardized audit
record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as
necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information
collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information
is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans and correlating attack detection
events with scanning results. Correlation with performance data can help uncover denial of
service attacks or cyber attacks resulting in unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with
system monitoring information can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit
information to operational situations. Related controls: AU-12, IR-4, RA-5.
(6)

AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CORRELATION WITH PHYSICAL MONITORING

The organization correlates information from audit records with information obtained from
monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate,
unusual, or malevolent activity.

The correlation of physical audit information and audit logs from
information systems may assist organizations in identifying examples of suspicious behavior
or supporting evidence of such behavior. For example, the correlation of an individual’s
identify for logical access to certain information systems with the additional physical security
information that the individual was actually present at the facility when the logical access
occurred, may prove to be useful in investigations.

AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | PERMITTED ACTIONS

The organization specifies the permitted actions for each [Selection (one or more): information
system process; role; user] associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit
information.

Organizations specify permitted actions for information system
processes, roles, and/or users associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit
records through account management techniques. Specifying permitted actions on audit
information is a way to enforce the principle of least privilege. Permitted actions are enforced
by the information system and include, for example, read, write, execute, append, and delete.

Supplemental Guidance:

AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | FULL TEXT ANALYSIS OF PRIVILEGED COMMANDS

The organization performs a full text analysis of audited privileged commands in a physically
distinct component or subsystem of the information system, or other information system that is
dedicated to that analysis.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires a distinct environment for the
dedicated analysis of audit information related to privileged users without compromising such
information on the information system where the users have elevated privileges including the
capability to execute privileged commands. Full text analysis refers to analysis that considers
the full text of privileged commands (i.e., commands and all parameters) as opposed to
analysis that considers only the name of the command. Full text analysis includes, for
example, the use of pattern matching and heuristics. Related controls: AU-3, AU-9, AU-11,
AU-12.
(9)

AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CORRELATION WITH INFORMATION FROM NONTECHNICAL SOURCES

The organization correlates information from nontechnical sources with audit information to
enhance organization-wide situational awareness.

Nontechnical sources include, for example, human resources records
documenting organizational policy violations (e.g., sexual harassment incidents, improper use
of organizational information assets). Such information can lead organizations to a more
directed analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider activity. Due to the sensitive
nature of the information available from nontechnical sources, organizations limit access to
such information to minimize the potential for the inadvertent release of privacy-related
information to individuals that do not have a need to know. Thus, correlation of information
Supplemental Guidance:

a.

Supports on-demand audit review, analysis, and reporting requirements and after-the-fact
investigations of security incidents; and

b.

Does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.

Audit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information
and organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit
reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same information
system or from the same organizational entities conducting auditing activities. Audit reduction
capability can include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to
identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the
information system can generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit records can be a
significant issue if the granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient. Related control:

Events of interest can be identified by the content of specific audit
record fields including, for example, identities of individuals, event types, event locations,
event times, event dates, system resources involved, IP addresses involved, or information
objects accessed. Organizations may define audit event criteria to any degree of granularity

Uses internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records; and

b.

Records time stamps for audit records that can be mapped to Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and meets [Assignment: organization-defined
granularity of time measurement].

Time stamps generated by the information system include date and time.
Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time
measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and
reference clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within
tens of milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for different system
components. Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities such as access control
and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support
those capabilities. Related controls: AU-3, AU-12.

PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | HARDWARE WRITE-ONCE MEDIA
The information system writes audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to the initial generation of audit
trails (i.e., the collection of audit records that represents the audit information to be used for
detection, analysis, and reporting purposes) and to the backup of those audit trails. The
enhancement does not apply to the initial generation of audit records prior to being written to
an audit trail. Write-once, read-many (WORM) media includes, for example, Compact DiskRecordable (CD-R) and Digital Video Disk-Recordable (DVD-R). In contrast, the use of
switchable write-protection media such as on tape cartridges or Universal Serial Bus (USB)
drives results in write-protected, but not write-once, media. Related controls: AU-4, AU-5.
(2)

PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | AUDIT BACKUP ON SEPARATE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS / COMPONENTS
The information system backs up audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] onto
a physically different system or system component than the system or component being audited.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement helps to ensure that a compromise of the
information system being audited does not also result in a compromise of the audit records.
Related controls: AU-4, AU-5, AU-11.
(3)

PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit
information and audit tools.

Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of audit
information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography
enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the
confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash. Related controls: AU-10, SC-12,
SC-13.

Supplemental Guidance:

PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | ACCESS BY SUBSET OF PRIVILEGED USERS

The organization authorizes access to management of audit functionality to only [Assignment:
organization-defined subset of privileged users].

Individuals with privileged access to an information system and who
are also the subject of an audit by that system, may affect the reliability of audit information
by inhibiting audit activities or modifying audit records. This control enhancement requires
that privileged access be further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges,
thus limiting the users with audit-related privileges. Related control: AC-5.
Supplemental Guidance:

(5)

PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | DUAL AUTHORIZATION

The organization enforces dual authorization for [Selection (one or more): movement; deletion] of
[Assignment: organization-defined audit information].

Organizations may choose different selection options for different
types of audit information. Dual authorization mechanisms require the approval of two
authorized individuals in order to execute. Related controls: AC-3, MP-2.

Supplemental Guidance:

(6)

PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | READ ONLY ACCESS

The organization authorizes read-only access to audit information to [Assignment: organizationdefined subset of privileged users].

Restricting privileged user authorizations to read-only helps to limit
the potential damage to organizations that could be initiated by such users (e.g., deleting audit
records to cover up malicious activity).

NON-REPUDIATION
Control: The information system protects against an individual (or process acting on behalf of an
individual) falsely denying having performed [Assignment: organization-defined actions to be
covered by non-repudiation].

Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include, for
example, creating information, sending and receiving messages, approving information (e.g.,
indicating concurrence or signing a contract). Non-repudiation protects individuals against later
claims by: (i) authors of not having authored particular documents; (ii) senders of not having
transmitted messages; (iii) receivers of not having received messages; or (iv) signatories of not
having signed documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information
originated from a particular individual, or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an
email, signing a contract, approving a procurement request) or received specific information.
Organizations obtain non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms
(e.g., digital signatures, digital message receipts). Related controls: SC-12, SC-8, SC-13, SC-16,
SC-17, SC-23.

Supplemental Guidance:

Control Enhancements:

NON-REPUDIATION | ASSOCIATION OF IDENTITIES

The information system:
(a)

Binds the identity of the information producer with the information to [Assignment:
organization-defined strength of binding]; and

(b) Provides the means for authorized individuals to determine the identity of the producer of the
information.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement supports audit requirements that provide
organizational personnel with the means to identify who produced specific information in the
event of an information transfer. Organizations determine and approve the strength of the
binding between the information producer and the information based on the security category
of the information and relevant risk factors. Related controls: AC-4, AC-16.
(2)

NON-REPUDIATION | VALIDATE BINDING OF INFORMATION PRODUCER IDENTITY

The information system:
(a)

Validates the binding of the information producer identity to the information at [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency]; and

(b) Performs [Assignment: organization-defined actions] in the event of a validation error.

This control enhancement prevents the modification of information
between production and review. The validation of bindings can be achieved, for example, by
the use of cryptographic checksums. Organizations determine if validations are in response to
user requests or generated automatically. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-16.
Supplemental Guidance:

(3)

NON-REPUDIATION | CHAIN OF CUSTODY
The information system maintains reviewer/releaser identity and credentials within the established
chain of custody for all information reviewed or released.

Chain of custody is a process that tracks the movement of evidence
through its collection, safeguarding, and analysis life cycle by documenting each person who
handled the evidence, the date and time it was collected or transferred, and the purpose for the
transfer. If the reviewer is a human or if the review function is automated but separate from
the release/transfer function, the information system associates the identity of the reviewer of
the information to be released with the information and the information label. In the case of
human reviews, this control enhancement provides organizational officials the means to
identify who reviewed and released the information. In the case of automated reviews, this
control enhancement ensures that only approved review functions are employed. Related
controls: AC-4, AC-16.

AUDIT RECORD RETENTION
Control: The organization retains audit records for [Assignment: organization-defined time period
consistent with records retention policy] to provide support for after-the-fact investigations of
security incidents and to meet regulatory and organizational information retention requirements.

Organizations retain audit records until it is determined that they are no
longer needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational purposes. This includes, for
example, retention and availability of audit records relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
requests, subpoenas, and law enforcement actions. Organizations develop standard categories of
audit records relative to such types of actions and standard response processes for each type of
action. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedules

AUDIT GENERATION | SYSTEM-WIDE / TIME-CORRELATED AUDIT TRAIL

The information system compiles audit records from [Assignment: organization-defined
information system components] into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is timecorrelated to within [Assignment: organization-defined level of tolerance for relationship between
time stamps of individual records in the audit trail].

Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual
audit records can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to achieve a time
ordering of the records within organizational tolerances. Related controls: AU-8, AU-12.

Supplemental Guidance:

(2)

AUDIT GENERATION | STANDARDIZED FORMATS

The information system produces a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail composed of audit
records in a standardized format.

Audit information that is normalized to common standards promotes
interoperability and exchange of such information between dissimilar devices and information
systems. This facilitates production of event information that can be more readily analyzed
and correlated. Standard formats for audit records include, for example, system log records
and audit records compliant with Common Event Expressions (CEE). If logging mechanisms
within information systems do not conform to standardized formats, systems may convert
individual audit records into standardized formats when compiling system-wide audit trails.

Supplemental Guidance:

system components] based on [Assignment: organization-defined selectable event criteria] within
[Assignment: organization-defined time thresholds].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement enables organizations to extend or limit
auditing as necessary to meet organizational requirements. Auditing that is limited to conserve
information system resources may be extended to address certain threat situations. In addition,
auditing may be limited to a specific set of events to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and
reporting. Organizations can establish time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for
example, near real-time, within minutes, or within hours. Related control: AU-7.

CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING
Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined methods] for coordinating
[Assignment: organization-defined audit information] among external organizations when audit
information is transmitted across organizational boundaries.

When organizations use information systems and/or services of external
organizations, the auditing capability necessitates a coordinated approach across organizations.
For example, maintaining the identity of individuals that requested particular services across
organizational boundaries may often be very difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant
performance ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational auditing (e.g.,
the type of auditing capability provided by service-oriented architectures) simply captures the
identity of individuals issuing requests at the initial information system, and subsequent systems
record that the requests emanated from authorized individuals. Related control: AU-6.
Supplemental Guidance:

Control Enhancements:

CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING | SHARING OF AUDIT INFORMATION

The organization provides cross-organizational audit information to [Assignment: organizationdefined organizations] based on [Assignment: organization-defined cross-organizational sharing
agreements].
Supplemental Guidance: Because of the distributed nature of the audit information, crossorganization sharing of audit information may be essential for effective analysis of the
auditing being performed. For example, the audit records of one organization may not provide
sufficient information to determine the appropriate or inappropriate use of organizational
information resources by individuals in other organizations. In some instances, only the home
organizations of individuals have the appropriate knowledge to make such determinations,
thus requiring the sharing of audit information among organizations.

d.

Provides the results of the security control assessment to [Assignment: organization-defined
individuals or roles].

Organizations assess security controls in organizational information
systems and the environments in which those systems operate as part of: (i) initial and ongoing
security authorizations; (ii) FISMA annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv)
system development life cycle activities. Security assessments: (i) ensure that information security
is built into organizational information systems; (ii) identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in
the development process; (iii) provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions
as part of security authorization processes; and (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation
procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls from Appendix F
(main catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented in System
Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can use other types of
assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the
security posture of information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports
document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to
determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to
meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement for assessing security controls at least
annually does not require additional assessment activities to those activities already in place in
organizational security authorization processes. Security assessment results are provided to the
individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example,
assessments conducted in support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing
officials or authorizing official designated representatives.

Supplemental Guidance:

To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the
following sources: (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous
monitoring; or (iii) system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security
assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness, and
obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing security control assessment
results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with
additional assessments as needed. Subsequent to initial authorizations and in accordance with
OMB policy, organizations assess security controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations
establish the frequency for ongoing security control assessments in accordance with organizational
continuous monitoring strategies. Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts provide useful
examples of vulnerability mitigation procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by external entities
such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control. Related controls: CA-5, CA-6,

SECURITY ASSESSMENTS | INDEPENDENT ASSESSORS

The organization employs assessors or assessment teams with [Assignment: organization-defined
level of independence] to conduct security control assessments.

Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups
who conduct impartial assessments of organizational information systems. Impartiality
implies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with regard to
the development, operation, or management of the organizational information systems under
assessment or to the determination of security control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality,
assessors should not: (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where
the assessments are being conducted; (ii) assess their own work; (iii) act as management or
employees of the organizations they are serving; or (iv) place themselves in positions of
advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be
obtained from elements within organizations or can be contracted to public or private sector
entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the required level of
independence based on the security categories of information systems and/or the ultimate risk
to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also
determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results

Supplemental Guidance:

APPENDIX F-CA

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. This includes determining
whether contracted security assessment services have sufficient independence, for example,
when information system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot
unduly influence the impartiality of assessors conducting assessments. In special situations,
for example, when organizations that own the information systems are small or organizational
structures require that assessments are conducted by individuals that are in the developmental,
operational, or management chain of system owners, independence in assessment processes
can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by
independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability
of the results. Organizations recognize that assessments performed for purposes other than
direct support to authorization decisions are, when performed by assessors with sufficient
independence, more likely to be useable for such decisions, thereby reducing the need to
repeat assessments.

performance/load testing; [Assignment: organization-defined other forms of security assessment]].

Organizations can employ information system monitoring, insider
threat assessments, malicious user testing, and other forms of testing (e.g., verification and
validation) to improve readiness by exercising organizational capabilities and indicating
current performance levels as a means of focusing actions to improve security. Organizations
conduct assessment activities in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Authorizing officials approve the assessment
methods in coordination with the organizational risk executive function. Organizations can
incorporate vulnerabilities uncovered during assessments into vulnerability remediation
processes. Related controls: PE-3, SI-2.

SECURITY ASSESSMENTS | EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS

The organization accepts the results of an assessment of [Assignment: organization-defined
information system] performed by [Assignment: organization-defined external organization] when
the assessment meets [Assignment: organization-defined requirements].

Organizations may often rely on assessments of specific information
systems by other (external) organizations. Utilizing such existing assessments (i.e., reusing
existing assessment evidence) can significantly decrease the time and resources required for
organizational assessments by limiting the amount of independent assessment activities that
organizations need to perform. The factors that organizations may consider in determining
whether to accept assessment results from external organizations can vary. Determinations for
accepting assessment results can be based on, for example, past assessment experiences one
organization has had with another organization, the reputation that organizations have with
regard to assessments, the level of detail of supporting assessment documentation provided, or
mandates imposed upon organizations by federal legislation, policies, or directives.

Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to dedicated connections between information systems
(i.e., system interconnections) and does not apply to transitory, user-controlled connections such
as email and website browsing. Organizations carefully consider the risks that may be introduced
when information systems are connected to other systems with different security requirements and
security controls, both within organizations and external to organizations. Authorizing officials
determine the risk associated with information system connections and the appropriate controls
employed. If interconnecting systems have the same authorizing official, organizations do not
need to develop Interconnection Security Agreements. Instead, organizations can describe the
interface characteristics between those interconnecting systems in their respective security plans.
If interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials within the same organization,
organizations can either develop Interconnection Security Agreements or describe the interface
characteristics between systems in the security plans for the respective systems. Organizations
may also incorporate Interconnection Security Agreement information into formal contracts,
especially for interconnections established between federal agencies and nonfederal (i.e., private
sector) organizations. Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same
networks. For certain technologies (e.g., space, unmanned aerial vehicles, and medical devices),
there may be specialized connections in place during preoperational testing. Such connections may
require Interconnection Security Agreements and be subject to additional security controls.

SECURITY AUTHORIZATION
Control:

The organization:

a.

Assigns a senior-level executive or manager as the authorizing official for the information
system;

b.

Ensures that the authorizing official authorizes the information system for processing before
commencing operations; and

c.

Updates the security authorization [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

Security authorizations are official management decisions, conveyed
through authorization decision documents, by senior organizational officials or executives (i.e.,
authorizing officials) to authorize operation of information systems and to explicitly accept the
risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based
on the implementation of agreed-upon security controls. Authorizing officials provide budgetary
oversight for organizational information systems or assume responsibility for the mission/business
operations supported by those systems. The security authorization process is an inherently federal
responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through the security
authorization process, authorizing officials assume responsibility and are accountable for security
risks associated with the operation and use of organizational information systems. Accordingly,
authorizing officials are in positions with levels of authority commensurate with understanding
and accepting such information security-related risks. OMB policy requires that organizations
conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems by implementing continuous monitoring
programs. Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year reauthorization requirements, so
separate reauthorization processes are not necessary. Through the employment of comprehensive
continuous monitoring processes, critical information contained in authorization packages (i.e.,
security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an
ongoing basis, providing authorizing officials and information system owners with an up-to-date
status of the security state of organizational information systems and environments of operation.
To reduce the administrative cost of security reauthorization, authorizing officials use the results
of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering
reauthorization decisions. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, PM-9, PM-10.

f.

Response actions to address results of the analysis of security-related information; and

g.

Reporting the security status of organization and the information system to [Assignment:

Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats,
vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk management decisions. The
terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess/analyze security controls and
information security-related risks at a frequency sufficient to support organizational risk-based
decisions. The results of continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response
actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs also allow organizations to maintain
the security authorizations of information systems and common controls over time in highly
dynamic environments of operation with changing mission/business needs, threats, vulnerabilities,
and technologies. Having access to security-related information on a continuing basis through
reports/dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make more effective and timely
risk management decisions, including ongoing security authorization decisions. Automation
supports more frequent updates to security authorization packages, hardware/software/firmware
inventories, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous
monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable,
relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security
categories of information systems. Related controls: CA-2, CA-5, CA-6, CM-3, CM-4, PM-6, PM9, RA-5, SA-11, SA-12, SI-2, SI-4.

CONTINUOUS MONITORING | INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT
The organization employs assessors or assessment teams with [Assignment: organization-defined
level of independence] to monitor the security controls in the information system on an ongoing
basis.

Organizations can maximize the value of assessments of security
controls during the continuous monitoring process by requiring that such assessments be
conducted by assessors or assessment teams with appropriate levels of independence based on
continuous monitoring strategies. Assessor independence provides a degree of impartiality to
the monitoring process. To achieve such impartiality, assessors should not: (i) create a mutual
or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted; (ii)
assess their own work; (iii) act as management or employees of the organizations they are
serving; or (iv) place themselves in advocacy positions for the organizations acquiring their
services.

Trend analyses can include, for example, examining recent threat
information regarding the types of threat events that have occurred within the organization or
across the federal government, success rates of certain types of cyber attacks, emerging
vulnerabilities in information technologies, evolving social engineering techniques, results
from multiple security control assessments, the effectiveness of configuration settings, and

PENETRATION TESTING
Control: The organization conducts penetration testing [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency] on [Assignment: organization-defined information systems or system components].

Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on
information systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be
exploited by adversaries. Such testing can be used to either validate vulnerabilities or determine
the degree of resistance organizational information systems have to adversaries within a set of
specified constraints (e.g., time, resources, and/or skills). Penetration testing attempts to duplicate
the actions of adversaries in carrying out hostile cyber attacks against organizations and provides a
more in-depth analysis of security-related weaknesses/deficiencies. Organizations can also use the
results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be
conducted on the hardware, software, or firmware components of an information system and can
exercise both physical and technical security controls. A standard method for penetration testing
includes, for example: (i) pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the target system; (ii) pretest
identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and (iii) testing designed to
determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the rules of engagement
before the commencement of penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the penetration
testing rules of engagement with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be
employed by adversaries carrying out attacks. Organizational risk assessments guide decisions on
the level of independence required for personnel conducting penetration testing. Related control:

implies that penetration agents or teams are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of
interest with regard to the development, operation, or management of the information systems
that are the targets of the penetration testing. Supplemental guidance for CA-2 (1) provides

PENETRATION TESTING | RED TEAM EXERCISES

The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined red team exercises] to simulate
attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information systems in accordance with
[Assignment: organization-defined rules of engagement].

Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing by
examining the security posture of organizations and their ability to implement effective cyber
defenses. As such, red team exercises reflect simulated adversarial attempts to compromise
organizational mission/business functions and provide a comprehensive assessment of the
security state of information systems and organizations. Simulated adversarial attempts to
compromise organizational missions/business functions and the information systems that
support those missions/functions may include technology-focused attacks (e.g., interactions
with hardware, software, or firmware components and/or mission/business processes) and
social engineering-based attacks (e.g., interactions via email, telephone, shoulder surfing, or
personal conversations). While penetration testing may be largely laboratory-based testing,
organizations use red team exercises to provide more comprehensive assessments that reflect

organizations to apply the configuration management that is most appropriate for each type of
configuration. For example, management of operational configurations typically emphasizes
the need for stability, while management of development/test configurations requires greater
flexibility. Configurations in the test environment mirror the configurations in the operational
environment to the extent practicable so that the results of the testing are representative of the

When it is known that information systems, system components, or
devices (e.g., notebook computers, mobile devices) will be located in high-risk areas,
additional security controls may be implemented to counter the greater threat in such areas
coupled with the lack of physical security relative to organizational-controlled areas. For
example, organizational policies and procedures for notebook computers used by individuals
departing on and returning from travel include, for example, determining which locations are
of concern, defining required configurations for the devices, ensuring that the devices are
configured as intended before travel is initiated, and applying specific safeguards to the
device after travel is completed. Specially configured notebook computers include, for
example, computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and additional hardening
(e.g., more stringent configuration settings). Specified safeguards applied to mobile devices
upon return from travel include, for example, examining the device for signs of physical
tampering and purging/reimaging the hard disk drive. Protecting information residing on
mobile devices is covered in the media protection family..

CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
Control:

The organization:

a.

Establishes and documents configuration settings for information technology products
employed within the information system using [Assignment: organization-defined security
configuration checklists] that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational
requirements;

b.

Implements the configuration settings;

c.

Identifies, documents, and approves any deviations from established configuration settings for
[Assignment: organization-defined information system components] based on [Assignment:
organization-defined operational requirements]; and

d.

Monitors and controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational
policies and procedures.

Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in
hardware, software, or firmware components of the information system that affect the security
posture and/or functionality of the system. Information technology products for which securityrelated configuration settings can be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers
(e.g., database, electronic mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations,
input/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls,
routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors),
operating systems, middleware, and applications. Security-related parameters are those parameters
impacting the security state of information systems including the parameters required to satisfy
other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example: (i) registry
settings; (ii) account, file, directory permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions, ports,
protocols, services, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide
configuration settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information systems. The
established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline.
Supplemental Guidance:

Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown
and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide
recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings
for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those
information system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations
can be developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information technology
product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and
other organizations in the public and private sectors. Common secure configurations include the

Configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities; and

b.

Prohibits or restricts the use of the following functions, ports, protocols, and/or services:
[Assignment: organization-defined prohibited or restricted functions, ports, protocols, and/or
services].

Information systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services.
Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential
organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient
to provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases
risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit
component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not
both). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual
components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for
elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing).
Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g.,
Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information
systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or
unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and

Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system
component inventories that include components from all organizational information systems. In
such situations, organizations ensure that the resulting inventories include system-specific
information required for proper component accountability (e.g., information system association,
information system owner). Information deemed necessary for effective accountability of
information system components includes, for example, hardware inventory specifications,
software license information, software version numbers, component owners, and for networked
components or devices, machine names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include,

INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ACCOUNTABILITY INFORMATION
The organization includes in the information system component inventory information, a means for
identifying by [Selection (one or more): name; position; role], individuals responsible/accountable
for administering those components.

Identifying individuals who are both responsible and accountable for
administering information system components helps to ensure that the assigned components

components.

Organizations may choose to implement centralized information
system component inventories that include components from all organizational information
systems. Centralized repositories of information system component inventories provide
opportunities for efficiencies in accounting for organizational hardware, software, and
firmware assets. Such repositories may also help organizations rapidly identify the location
and responsible individuals of system components that have been compromised, breached, or

for the information system that:

a.

Addresses roles, responsibilities, and configuration management processes and procedures;

b.

Establishes a process for identifying configuration items throughout the system development
life cycle and for managing the configuration of the configuration items;

c.

Defines the configuration items for the information system and places the configuration items
under configuration management; and

d.

Protects the configuration management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration
management policies while being tailored to individual information systems. Such plans define
detailed processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system
development life cycle activities at the information system level. Configuration management plans
are typically developed during the development/acquisition phase of the system development life
cycle. The plans describe how to move changes through change management processes, how to
update configuration settings and baselines, how to maintain information system component
inventories, how to control development, test, and operational environments, and how to develop,
release, and update key documents. Organizations can employ templates to help ensure consistent
and timely development and implementation of configuration management plans. Such templates
can represent a master configuration management plan for the organization at large with subsets of
the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management approval processes
include designation of key management stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving
proposed changes to information systems, and personnel that conduct security impact analyses
prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the information
system items (hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) to be configuration-managed. As
information systems continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration items
may be identified and some existing configuration items may no longer need to be under
configuration control. Related controls: CM-2, CM-3, CM-4, CM-5, CM-8, SA-10.

This separation of duties ensures that organizations establish and maintain a sufficient degree
of independence between the information system development and integration processes and
configuration management processes to facilitate quality control and more effective oversight.

Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall
organizational program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions.
Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation of
alternative mission/business processes when systems are compromised. The effectiveness of
contingency planning is maximized by considering such planning throughout the phases of the
system development life cycle. Performing contingency planning on hardware, software, and
firmware development can be an effective means of achieving information system resiliency.
Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational information
systems since not all systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of
operations desired. Information system recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, Executive
Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition to information
system availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in a
reduction in mission and/or business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the
confidentiality or integrity of information systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans
include, for example, orderly/graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a
manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are
under attack. By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities,
organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency planning activities are in place and
activated in the event of a security incident. Related controls: AC-14, CP-6, CP-7, CP-8, CP-9,

the primary means of implementing the security function is unavailable or compromised.

This control supports information system resiliency and contingency
planning/continuity of operations. To ensure mission/business continuity, organizations can
implement alternative or supplemental security mechanisms. These mechanisms may be less
effective than the primary mechanisms (e.g., not as easy to use, not as scalable, or not as secure).
However, having the capability to readily employ these alternative/supplemental mechanisms
enhances overall mission/business continuity that might otherwise be adversely impacted if
organizational operations had to be curtailed until the primary means of implementing the
functions was restored. Given the cost and level of effort required to provide such alternative
capabilities, this control would typically be applied only to critical security capabilities provided

organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such
access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type
of network access that involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet).
Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of
encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) for network connections between organizationcontrolled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal
networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information
traversing the network.
Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements in this control by
complying with the requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with
the specific organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the use of
two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors are defined as: (i) something
you know (e.g., password, personal identification number [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g.,
cryptographic identification device, token); or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor
solutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for
example, hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart
cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD common
access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information system level
(i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification and authentication mechanisms at the
application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security. Identification and
authentication requirements for other than organizational users are described in IA-8. Related
controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8.

The organization requires individuals to be authenticated with an individual authenticator when a
group authenticator is employed.

Requiring individuals to use individual authenticators as a second level
of authentication helps organizations to mitigate the risk of using group authenticators.

Supplemental Guidance:

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS - REPLAY RESISTANT

The information system implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network
access to privileged accounts.

Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to
achieve successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages. Replayresistant techniques include, for example, protocols that use nonces or challenges such as
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and time synchronous or challenge-response one-time
authenticators.

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS - REPLAY RESISTANT

The information system implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network
access to non-privileged accounts.

Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to
achieve successful authentications by recording/replaying previous authentication messages.
Replay-resistant techniques include, for example, protocols that use nonces or challenges such
as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and time synchronous or challenge-response one-time
authenticators.
Supplemental Guidance:

(10) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | SINGLE SIGN-ON
The information system provides a single sign-on capability for [Assignment: organization-defined
list of information system accounts and services].

Single sign-on enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple
information system resources. Organizations consider the operational efficiencies provided by
single sign-on capabilities with the increased risk from disclosures of single authenticators
providing access to multiple system resources.

Supplemental Guidance:

(11) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | REMOTE ACCESS - SEPARATE DEVICE
The information system implements multifactor authentication for remote access to privileged and
non-privileged accounts such that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the
system gaining access and the device meets [Assignment: organization-defined strength of
mechanism requirements].
Supplemental Guidance: For remote access to privileged/non-privileged accounts, the purpose
of requiring a device that is separate from the information system gaining access for one of
the factors during multifactor authentication is to reduce the likelihood of compromising
authentication credentials stored on the system. For example, adversaries deploying malicious
code on organizational information systems can potentially compromise such credentials
resident on the system and subsequently impersonate authorized users. Related control: AC-6.
(12) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | ACCEPTANCE OF PIV CREDENTIALS
The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
credentials.

This control enhancement applies to organizations implementing
logical access control systems (LACS) and physical access control systems (PACS). Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) credentials are those credentials issued by federal agencies that
conform to FIPS Publication 201 and supporting guidance documents. OMB Memorandum
11-11 requires federal agencies to continue implementing the requirements specified in
HSPD-12 to enable agency-wide use of PIV credentials. Related controls: AU-2, PE-3, SA-4.

Supplemental Guidance:

(13) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | OUT-OF-BAND AUTHENTICATION
The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined out-of-band authentication]
under [Assignment: organization-defined conditions].
Supplemental Guidance: Out-of-band authentication (OOBA) refers to the use of two separate
communication paths to identify and authenticate users or devices to an information system.
The first path (i.e., the in-band path), is used to identify and authenticate users or devices, and
generally is the path through which information flows. The second path (i.e., the out-of-band
path) is used to independently verify the authentication and/or requested action. For example,
a user authenticates via a notebook computer to a remote server to which the user desires
access, and requests some action of the server via that communication path. Subsequently, the
server contacts the user via the user’s cell phone to verify that the requested action originated

from the user. The user may either confirm the intended action to an individual on the
telephone or provide an authentication code via the telephone. This type of authentication can
be employed by organizations to mitigate actual or suspected man-in the-middle attacks. The
conditions for activation can include, for example, suspicious activities, new threat indicators
or elevated threat levels, or the impact level or classification level of information in requested
transactions. Related controls: IA-10, IA-11, SC-37.

DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates [Assignment: organizationdefined specific and/or types of devices] before establishing a [Selection (one or more): local;
remote; network] connection.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational devices requiring unique device-to-device identification and
authentication may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type/device. Information
systems typically use either shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or
organizational authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol
[EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to
identify/authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks. Organizations determine the
required strength of authentication mechanisms by the security categories of information systems.
Because of the challenges of applying this control on large scale, organizations are encouraged to
only apply the control to those limited number (and type) of devices that truly need to support this
capability. Related controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, CA-3, IA-4, IA-5.
Control Enhancements:

DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | CRYPTOGRAPHIC BIDIRECTIONAL AUTHENTICATION

The information system authenticates [Assignment: organization-defined specific devices and/or
types of devices] before establishing [Selection (one or more): local; remote; network] connection
using bidirectional authentication that is cryptographically based.

A local connection is any connection with a device communicating
without the use of a network. A network connection is any connection with a device that
communicates through a network (e.g., local area or wide area network, Internet). A remote
connection is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g.,
the Internet). Bidirectional authentication provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity
of other devices for connections that are of greater risk (e.g., remote connections). Related
controls: SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.

DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | DEVICE ATTESTATION

The organization ensures that device identification and authentication based on attestation is
handled by [Assignment: organization-defined configuration management process].

Device attestation refers to the identification and authentication of a
device based on its configuration and known operating state. This might be determined via
some cryptographic hash of the device. If device attestation is the means of identification and
authentication, then it is important that patches and updates to the device are handled via a
configuration management process such that the those patches/updates are done securely and
at the same time do not disrupt the identification and authentication to other devices.

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT
Control:

The organization manages information system identifiers by:

a.

Receiving authorization from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to assign
an individual, group, role, or device identifier;

b.

Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, or device;

c.

Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, or device;

d.

Preventing reuse of identifiers for [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and

e.

Disabling the identifier after [Assignment: organization-defined time period of inactivity].

Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control
(MAC), Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management of
individual identifiers is not applicable to shared information system accounts (e.g., guest and
anonymous accounts). Typically, individual identifiers are the user names of the information
system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account management
activities of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. This control also addresses individual
identifiers not necessarily associated with information system accounts (e.g., identifiers used in
physical security control databases accessed by badge reader systems for access to information
systems). Preventing reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used
individual, group, role, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, or devices.
Related controls: AC-2, IA-2, IA-3, IA-5, IA-8, SC-37.
Supplemental Guidance:

Control Enhancements:
(1)

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | PROHIBIT ACCOUNT IDENTIFIERS AS PUBLIC IDENTIFIERS
The organization prohibits the use of information system account identifiers that are the same as
public identifiers for individual electronic mail accounts.

Prohibiting the use of information systems account identifiers that are
the same as some public identifier such as the individual identifier section of an electronic
mail address, makes it more difficult for adversaries to guess user identifiers on organizational
information systems. Related control: AT-2.
Supplemental Guidance:

(2)

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | SUPERVISOR AUTHORIZATION

The organization requires that the registration process to receive an individual identifier includes
supervisor authorization.

(3)

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | MULTIPLE FORMS OF CERTIFICATION

The organization requires multiple forms of certification of individual identification such as
documentary evidence or a combination of documents and biometrics be presented to the
registration authority.

Requiring multiple forms of identification reduces the likelihood of
individuals using fraudulent identification to establish an identity, or at least increases the
work factor of potential adversaries.
Supplemental Guidance:

(4)

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | IDENTIFY USER STATUS

The organization manages individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual as
[Assignment: organization-defined characteristic identifying individual status].
Supplemental Guidance: Characteristics identifying the status of individuals include, for
example, contractors and foreign nationals. Identifying the status of individuals by specific
characteristics provides additional information about the people with whom organizational
personnel are communicating. For example, it might be useful for a government employee to
know that one of the individuals on an email message is a contractor. Related control: AT-2.
(5)

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC MANAGEMENT

The information system dynamically manages identifiers.

In contrast to conventional approaches to identification which presume
static accounts for preregistered users, many distributed information systems including, for
example, service-oriented architectures, rely on establishing identifiers at run time for entities
that were previously unknown. In these situations, organizations anticipate and provision for
the dynamic establishment of identifiers. Preestablished trust relationships and mechanisms
with appropriate authorities to validate identities and related credentials are essential. Related
control: AC-16.
Supplemental Guidance:

(6)

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | CROSS-ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT

The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] for
cross-organization management of identifiers.
Supplemental Guidance: Cross-organization identifier management provides the capability for
organizations to appropriately identify individuals, groups, roles, or devices when conducting
cross-organization activities involving the processing, storage, or transmission of information.
(7)

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | IN-PERSON REGISTRATION
The organization requires that the registration process to receive an individual identifier be
conducted in person before a designated registration authority.

Supplemental Guidance: In-person registration reduces the likelihood of fraudulent identifiers
being issued because it requires the physical presence of individuals and actual face-to-face
interactions with designated registration authorities.

Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group,
role, or device receiving the authenticator;

b.

Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by the organization;

c.

Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;

APPENDIX F-IA

________________________________________________________________________________________________

d.

Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution,
for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;

e.

Changing default content of authenticators prior to information system installation;

f.

Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for
authenticators;

g.

Changing/refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time period by
authenticator type];

h.

Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;

i.

Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to
protect authenticators; and

j.

Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.

Supplemental Guidance: Individual authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens,
biometrics, PKI certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g.,
the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum
password length). In many cases, developers ship information system components with factory
default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default
authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant
security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control
PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and
SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information systems (e.g., passwords stored
in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with
administrator privileges). Information systems support individual authenticator management by
organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including,
for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time
synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of
biometric authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators include, for
example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing individual
authenticators with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately.
Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators
for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include,
for example, certificates and passwords. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, CM-6, IA-2, IA-4,
IA-8, PL-4, PS-5, PS-6, SC-12, SC-13, SC-17, SC-28.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | PASSWORD-BASED AUTHENTICATION

The information system, for password-based authentication:
(a)

Enforces minimum password complexity of [Assignment: organization-defined requirements
for case sensitivity, number of characters, mix of upper-case letters, lower-case letters,
numbers, and special characters, including minimum requirements for each type];

(b) Enforces at least the following number of changed characters when new passwords are
created: [Assignment: organization-defined number];
(c)

Stores and transmits only encrypted representations of passwords;

(d) Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of [Assignment: organizationdefined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime maximum];
(e)

Prohibits password reuse for [Assignment: organization-defined number] generations; and

(f)

Allows the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a
permanent password.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to single-factor authentication of
individuals using passwords as individual or group authenticators, and in a similar manner,
when passwords are part of multifactor authenticators. This control enhancement does not
apply when passwords are used to unlock hardware authenticators (e.g., Personal Identity

APPENDIX F-IA

PAGE F-96

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Verification cards). The implementation of such password mechanisms may not meet all of
the requirements in the enhancement. Encrypted representations of passwords include, for
example, encrypted versions of passwords and one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords.
The number of changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to
the total number of positions in the current password. Password lifetime restrictions do not
apply to temporary passwords. Related control: IA-6.
(2)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | PKI-BASED AUTHENTICATION

The information system, for PKI-based authentication:
(a)

Validates certifications by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust
anchor including checking certificate status information;

(b) Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key;
(c)

Maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and

(d) Implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation in case
of inability to access revocation information via the network.

Status information for certification paths includes, for example,
certificate revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards, validation of
certifications involves the construction and verification of a certification path to the Common
Policy Root trust anchor including certificate policy processing. Related control: IA-6.

Supplemental Guidance:

(3)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | IN-PERSON OR TRUSTED THIRD-PARTY REGISTRATION
The organization requires that the registration process to receive [Assignment: organizationdefined types of and/or specific authenticators] be conducted [Selection: in person; by a trusted
third party] before [Assignment: organization-defined registration authority] with authorization by
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].

(4)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR PASSWORD STRENGTH DETERMINATION
The organization employs automated tools to determine if password authenticators are sufficiently
strong to satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined requirements].

This control enhancement focuses on the creation of strong passwords
and the characteristics of such passwords (e.g., complexity) prior to use, the enforcement of
which is carried out by organizational information systems in IA-5 (1). Related controls: CA2, CA-7, RA-5.
Supplemental Guidance:

(5)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | CHANGE AUTHENTICATORS PRIOR TO DELIVERY

The organization requires developers/installers of information system components to provide
unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery/installation.

This control enhancement extends the requirement for organizations to
change default authenticators upon information system installation, by requiring developers
and/or installers to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators for system
components prior to delivery and/or installation. However, it typically does not apply to the
developers of commercial off-the-shelve information technology products. Requirements for
unique authenticators can be included in acquisition documents prepared by organizations
when procuring information systems or system components.
Supplemental Guidance:

(6)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | PROTECTION OF AUTHENTICATORS

The organization protects authenticators commensurate with the security category of the
information to which use of the authenticator permits access.

For information systems containing multiple security categories of
information without reliable physical or logical separation between categories, authenticators
used to grant access to the systems are protected commensurate with the highest security
category of information on the systems.

Supplemental Guidance:

(7)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | NO EMBEDDED UNENCRYPTED STATIC AUTHENTICATORS

The organization ensures that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications
or access scripts or stored on function keys.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations exercise caution in determining whether embedded or
stored authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are used in the
manner stored, then those representations are considered unencrypted authenticators. This is

APPENDIX F-IA

irrespective of whether that representation is perhaps an encrypted version of something else
(e.g., a password).
(8)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | MULTIPLE INFORMATION SYSTEM ACCOUNTS

The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to manage
the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple information systems.

When individuals have accounts on multiple information systems,
there is the risk that the compromise of one account may lead to the compromise of other
accounts if individuals use the same authenticators. Possible alternatives include, for example:
(i) having different authenticators on all systems; (ii) employing some form of single sign-on
mechanism; or (iii) including some form of one-time passwords on all systems.

Supplemental Guidance:

(9)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | CROSS-ORGANIZATION CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT

The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] for
cross-organization management of credentials.

Cross-organization management of credentials provides the capability
for organizations to appropriately authenticate individuals, groups, roles, or devices when
conducting cross-organization activities involving the processing, storage, or transmission of
information.

Supplemental Guidance:

(10) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC CREDENTIAL ASSOCIATION
The information system dynamically provisions identities.

Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity and
the authenticator used to confirm the identity. In conventional approaches, this binding is
established by pre-provisioning both the identity and the authenticator to the information
system. For example, the binding between a username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e.,
authenticator) is accomplished by provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair in the
information system. New authentication techniques allow the binding between the identity
and the authenticator to be implemented outside an information system. For example, with
smartcard credentials, the identity and the authenticator are bound together on the card. Using
these credentials, information systems can authenticate identities that have not been preprovisioned, dynamically provisioning the identity after authentication. In these situations,
organizations can anticipate the dynamic provisioning of identities. Preestablished trust
relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate identities and related
credentials are essential.
Supplemental Guidance:

(11) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | HARDWARE TOKEN-BASED AUTHENTICATION
The information system, for hardware token-based authentication, employs mechanisms that
satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined token quality requirements].

Hardware token-based authentication typically refers to the use of
PKI-based tokens, such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card.
Organizations define specific requirements for tokens, such as working with a particular PKI.

Supplemental Guidance:

(12) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION
The information system, for biometric-based authentication, employs mechanisms that satisfy
[Assignment: organization-defined biometric quality requirements].
Supplemental Guidance: Unlike password-based authentication which provides exact matches
of user-input passwords to stored passwords, biometric authentication does not provide such
exact matches. Depending upon the type of biometric and the type of collection mechanism,
there is likely to be some divergence from the presented biometric and stored biometric which
serves as the basis of comparison. There will likely be both false positives and false negatives
when making such comparisons. The rate at which the false accept and false reject rates are
equal is known as the crossover rate. Biometric quality requirements include, for example,
acceptable crossover rates, as that essentially reflects the accuracy of the biometric.
(13) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | EXPIRATION OF CACHED AUTHENTICATORS
The information system prohibits the use of cached authenticators after [Assignment:
organization-defined time period].

The organization, for PKI-based authentication, employs a deliberate organization-wide
methodology for managing the content of PKI trust stores installed across all platforms including
networks, operating systems, browsers, and applications.
(15) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | FICAM-APPROVED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AUTHENTICATOR FEEDBACK
Control: The information system obscures feedback of authentication information during the
authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized
individuals.

The feedback from information systems does not provide information that
would allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types
of information systems or system components, for example, desktops/notebooks with relatively
large monitors, the threat (often referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types
of systems or components, for example, mobile devices with 2-4 inch screens, this threat may be
less significant, and may need to be balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input
errors due to the small keyboards. Therefore, the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is
selected accordingly. Obscuring the feedback of authentication information includes, for example,
displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices, or displaying feedback for a
very limited time before fully obscuring it. Related control: PE-18.

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)
Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates non-organizational users (or
processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users).

Non-organizational users include information system users other than
organizational users explicitly covered by IA-2. These individuals are uniquely identified and
authenticated for accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented in AC14. In accordance with the E-Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of nonorganizational users accessing federal information systems may be required to protect federal,
proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national security systems).
Organizations use risk assessments to determine authentication needs and consider scalability,
practicality, and security in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal

Adversaries may compromise individual authentication mechanisms and
subsequently attempt to impersonate legitimate users. This situation can potentially occur with any
authentication mechanisms employed by organizations. To address this threat, organizations may
employ specific techniques/mechanisms and establish protocols to assess suspicious behavior
(e.g., individuals accessing information that they do not typically access as part of their normal
duties, roles, or responsibilities, accessing greater quantities of information than the individuals
would routinely access, or attempting to access information from suspicious network addresses).
In these situations when certain preestablished conditions or triggers occur, organizations can
require selected individuals to provide additional authentication information. Another potential use
for adaptive identification and authentication is to increase the strength of mechanism based on the

INCIDENT HANDLING
Control:

The organization:

a.

Implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes preparation,
detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery;

b.

Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities; and

c.

Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response
procedures, training, and testing/exercises, and implements the resulting changes accordingly.

Organizations recognize that incident response capability is dependent on
the capabilities of organizational information systems and the mission/business processes being
supported by those systems. Therefore, organizations consider incident response as part of the
definition, design, and development of mission/business processes and information systems.
Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example,
audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user/administrator reports, and
reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling capability includes coordination among
many organizational entities including, for example, mission/business owners, information system
owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices,
legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk executive (function).

information system components] as part of the incident response capability.

Dynamic reconfiguration includes, for example, changes to router
rules, access control lists, intrusion detection/prevention system parameters, and filter rules
for firewalls and gateways. Organizations perform dynamic reconfiguration of information
systems, for example, to stop attacks, to misdirect attackers, and to isolate components of
systems, thus limiting the extent of the damage from breaches or compromises. Organizations
include time frames for achieving the reconfiguration of information systems in the definition
of the reconfiguration capability, considering the potential need for rapid response in order to
effectively address sophisticated cyber threats. Related controls: AC-2, AC-4, AC-16, CM-2,

INCIDENT HANDLING | CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS

The organization identifies [Assignment: organization-defined classes of incidents] and
[Assignment: organization-defined actions to take in response to classes of incidents] to ensure
continuation of organizational missions and business functions.

Classes of incidents include, for example, malfunctions due to
design/implementation errors and omissions, targeted malicious attacks, and untargeted
malicious attacks. Appropriate incident response actions include, for example, graceful
degradation, information system shutdown, fall back to manual mode/alternative technology
whereby the system operates differently, employing deceptive measures, alternate information
flows, or operating in a mode that is reserved solely for when systems are under attack.

Supplemental Guidance:

(4)

INCIDENT HANDLING | INFORMATION CORRELATION

The organization correlates incident information and individual incident responses to achieve an
organization-wide perspective on incident awareness and response.

Sometimes the nature of a threat event, for example, a hostile cyber
attack, is such that it can only be observed by bringing together information from different
sources including various reports and reporting procedures established by organizations.

INCIDENT HANDLING | INSIDER THREATS - INTRA-ORGANIZATION COORDINATION
The organization coordinates incident handling capability for insider threats across [Assignment:
organization-defined components or elements of the organization].

Incident handling for insider threat incidents (including preparation,
detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery) requires close coordination
among a variety of organizational components or elements to be effective. These components
or elements include, for example, mission/business owners, information system owners,
human resources offices, procurement offices, personnel/physical security offices, operations
personnel, and risk executive (function). In addition, organizations may require external
support from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.

Supplemental Guidance:

(8)

INCIDENT HANDLING | CORRELATION WITH EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS

The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] to

Supplemental Guidance: The coordination of incident information with external organizations
including, for example, mission/business partners, military/coalition partners, customers, and
multitiered developers, can provide significant benefits. Cross-organizational coordination
with respect to incident handling can serve as an important risk management capability. This
capability allows organizations to leverage critical information from a variety of sources to
effectively respond to information security-related incidents potentially affecting the
organization’s operations, assets, and individuals.
(9)

INCIDENT HANDLING | DYNAMIC RESPONSE CAPABILITY

The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined dynamic response capabilities] to
effectively respond to security incidents.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses the deployment of replacement or
new capabilities in a timely manner in response to security incidents (e.g., adversary actions
during hostile cyber attacks). This includes capabilities implemented at the mission/business
process level (e.g., activating alternative mission/business processes) and at the information
system level. Related control: CP-10.
(10) INCIDENT HANDLING | SUPPLY CHAIN COORDINATION
The organization coordinates incident handling activities involving supply chain events with other
organizations involved in the supply chain.

Information spillage refers to instances where either classified or sensitive
information is inadvertently placed on information systems that are not authorized to process such
information. Such information spills often occur when information that is initially thought to be of
lower sensitivity is transmitted to an information system and then is subsequently determined to be
of higher sensitivity. At that point, corrective action is required. The nature of the organizational
response is generally based upon the degree of sensitivity of the spilled information (e.g., security
category or classification level), the security capabilities of the information system, the specific
nature of contaminated storage media, and the access authorizations (e.g., security clearances) of
individuals with authorized access to the contaminated system. The methods used to communicate
information about the spill after the fact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual
spill to minimize the risk of further spreading the contamination before such contamination is
isolated and eradicated.

Control:

Supplemental Guidance: Having an integrated team for incident response facilitates information
sharing. Such capability allows organizational personnel, including developers, implementers, and
operators, to leverage the team knowledge of the threat in order to implement defensive measures
that will enable organizations to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, it promotes the rapid
detection of intrusions, development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective

TIMELY MAINTENANCE | PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE

The organization performs preventive maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined
information system components] at [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals].

Preventive maintenance includes proactive care and servicing of
organizational information systems components for the purpose of maintaining equipment and
facilities in satisfactory operating condition. Such maintenance provides for the systematic
inspection, tests, measurements, adjustments, parts replacement, detection, and correction of
incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects. The
primary goal of preventive maintenance is to avoid/mitigate the consequences of equipment
failures. Preventive maintenance is designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by
replacing worn components before they actually fail. Methods of determining what preventive
(or other) failure management policies to apply include, for example, original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) recommendations, statistical failure records, requirements of codes,
legislation, or regulations within a jurisdiction, expert opinion, maintenance that has already
been conducted on similar equipment, or measured values and performance indications.
Supplemental Guidance:

(2)

TIMELY MAINTENANCE | PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE

The organization performs predictive maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined
information system components] at [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals].
Supplemental Guidance: Predictive maintenance, or condition-based maintenance, attempts to
evaluate the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous (online) equipment
condition monitoring. The goal of predictive maintenance is to perform maintenance at a
scheduled point in time when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective and before the
equipment loses performance within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive
maintenance stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition.
This approach uses principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the
future maintenance activities will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are
performed while equipment is in service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal system
operations. Predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system
reliability. Predictive maintenance tends to include measurement of the item. To evaluate
equipment condition, predictive maintenance utilizes nondestructive testing technologies such
as infrared, acoustic (partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection, vibration
analysis, sound level measurements, oil analysis, and other specific online tests.
(3)

TIMELY MAINTENANCE | AUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE

The organization employs automated mechanisms to transfer predictive maintenance data to a
computerized maintenance management system.

A computerized maintenance management system maintains a
computer database of information about the maintenance operations of organizations and
automates processing equipment condition data in order to trigger maintenance planning,
execution, and reporting.

and/or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting information
and/or information systems.

Supplemental Guidance:

Physical and technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security category or
classification of the information residing on the media. Safeguards to protect media during
transport include, for example, locked containers and cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms
can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used.
Activities associated with transport include the actual transport as well as those activities such as
releasing media for transport and ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes.
For the actual transport, authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals from
outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport or delivery service).
Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes, for example, restricting transport
activities to authorized personnel, and tracking and/or obtaining explicit records of transport
activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss,

MEDIA SANITIZATION
Control:

The organization:

a.

Sanitizes [Assignment: organization-defined information system media] prior to disposal,
release out of organizational control, or release for reuse using [Assignment: organizationdefined sanitization techniques and procedures] in accordance with applicable federal and
organizational standards and policies; and

b.

Employs sanitization mechanisms with the strength and integrity commensurate with the
security category or classification of the information.

This control applies to all information system media, both digital and nondigital, subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples
include media found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network
components, and mobile devices. The sanitization process removes information from the media
such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including
clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to
unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations
determine the appropriate sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes
necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations
use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media
containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to
have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal.

Sanitization of non-digital media includes, for example, removing a classified appendix from an
otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by
obscuring the redacted sections/words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them
from the document. NSA standards and policies control the sanitization process for media
containing classified information. Related controls: MA-2, MA-4, RA-3, SC-4.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

MEDIA SANITIZATION | REVIEW / APPROVE / TRACK / DOCUMENT / VERIFY
The organization reviews, approves, tracks, documents, and verifies media sanitization and
disposal actions.

Organizations review and approve media to be sanitized to ensure
compliance with records-retention policies. Tracking/documenting actions include, for
example, listing personnel who reviewed and approved sanitization and disposal actions,
types of media sanitized, specific files stored on the media, sanitization methods used, date
and time of the sanitization actions, personnel who performed the sanitization, verification
actions taken, personnel who performed the verification, and disposal action taken.
Organizations verify that the sanitization of the media was effective prior to disposal. Related
control: SI-12.
Supplemental Guidance:

(2)

MEDIA SANITIZATION | EQUIPMENT TESTING

The organization tests sanitization equipment and procedures [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency] to verify that the intended sanitization is being achieved.
Supplemental Guidance: Testing of sanitization equipment and procedures may be conducted by
qualified and authorized external entities (e.g., other federal agencies or external service
providers).
(3)

MEDIA SANITIZATION | NONDESTRUCTIVE TECHNIQUES

The organization applies nondestructive sanitization techniques to portable storage devices prior
to connecting such devices to the information system under the following circumstances:
[Assignment: organization-defined circumstances requiring sanitization of portable storage
devices].

This control enhancement applies to digital media containing classified
information and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Portable storage devices can be
the source of malicious code insertions into organizational information systems. Many of
these devices are obtained from unknown and potentially untrustworthy sources and may
contain malicious code that can be readily transferred to information systems through USB
ports or other entry portals. While scanning such storage devices is always recommended,
sanitization provides additional assurance that the devices are free of malicious code to
include code capable of initiating zero-day attacks. Organizations consider nondestructive
sanitization of portable storage devices when such devices are first purchased from the
manufacturer or vendor prior to initial use or when organizations lose a positive chain of
custody for the devices. Related control: SI-3.

MEDIA SANITIZATION | REMOTE PURGING / WIPING OF INFORMATION
The organization provides the capability to purge/wipe information from [Assignment:
organization-defined information systems, system components, or devices] either remotely or
under the following conditions: [Assignment: organization-defined conditions].

This control enhancement protects data/information on organizational
information systems, system components, or devices (e.g., mobile devices) if such systems,
components, or devices are obtained by unauthorized individuals. Remote purge/wipe
commands require strong authentication to mitigate the risk of unauthorized individuals
purging/wiping the system/component/device. The purge/wipe function can be implemented
in a variety of ways including, for example, by overwriting data/information multiple times or
by destroying the key necessary to decrypt encrypted data.

MEDIA USE

The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of [Assignment: organizationdefined types of information system media] on [Assignment: organization-defined information
systems or system components] using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards].

Control:

Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media.
Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk
drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for
example, paper and microfilm. This control also applies to mobile devices with information
storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers). In contrast to MP-2, which restricts user
access to media, this control restricts the use of certain types of media on information systems, for
example, restricting/prohibiting the use of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations
can employ technical and nontechnical safeguards (e.g., policies, procedures, rules of behavior) to
restrict the use of information system media. Organizations may restrict the use of portable storage
devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to certain external
ports, or disabling/removing the ability to insert, read or write to such devices. Organizations may
also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices including, for example,
devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and
devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable
storage devices based on the type of device, for example, prohibiting the use of writeable, portable
storage devices, and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write
to such devices. Related controls: AC-19, PL-4.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

MEDIA USE | PROHIBIT USE WITHOUT OWNER

The organization prohibits the use of portable storage devices in organizational information
systems when such devices have no identifiable owner.

Requiring identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or
projects) for portable storage devices reduces the risk of using such technologies by allowing
organizations to assign responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities
in the devices (e.g., malicious code insertion). Related control: PL-4.

authorizations of the potential recipients of the downgraded information;

c.

Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined information system media requiring
downgrading]; and

d.

Downgrades the identified information system media using the established process.

Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to all information system media, digital and nondigital, subject to release outside of the organization, whether or not the media is considered
removable. The downgrading process, when applied to system media, removes information from
the media, typically by security category or classification level, such that the information cannot
be retrieved or reconstructed. Downgrading of media includes redacting information to enable
wider release and distribution. Downgrading of media also ensures that empty space on the media
(e.g., slack space within files) is devoid of information.
Control Enhancements:

b.

Distributes copies of the security plan and communicates subsequent changes to the plan to
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];

c.

frequency];

d.

Updates the plan to address changes to the information system/environment of operation or
problems identified during plan implementation or security control assessments; and

e.

Protects the security plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

Security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls and
control enhancements. Security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls and
control enhancements meet those security requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical
descriptions of the specific design or implementation of the controls/enhancements. Security plans
contain sufficient information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment and
selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is
unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is
implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the security control
baselines in Appendix D and CNSS Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use
or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or missions/environments of operation (e.g.,
DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential, and Access
Management, space operations). Appendix I provides guidance on developing overlays.

Supplemental Guidance:

Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of various documents
including documents that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of references
to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications)
where more detailed information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements
associated with security programs and maintains security-related information in other established
management/operational areas related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle,
systems engineering, and acquisition. For example, security plans do not contain detailed
contingency plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly or by
reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans. Related

a.

Establishes and makes readily available to individuals requiring access to the information
system, the rules that describe their responsibilities and expected behavior with regard to
information and information system usage;

b.

Receives a signed acknowledgment from such individuals, indicating that they have read,
understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior, before authorizing access to
information and the information system;

c.

Reviews and updates the rules of behavior [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

d.

Requires individuals who have signed a previous version of the rules of behavior to read and
resign when the rules of behavior are revised/updated.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to organizational users. Organizations
consider rules of behavior based on individual user roles and responsibilities, differentiating, for
example, between rules that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to general users.
Establishing rules of behavior for some types of non-organizational users including, for example,
individuals who simply receive data/information from federal information systems, is often not
feasible given the large number of such users and the limited nature of their interactions with the
systems. Rules of behavior for both organizational and non-organizational users can also be
established in AC-8, System Use Notification. PL-4 b. (the signed acknowledgment portion of this
control) may be satisfied by the security awareness training and role-based security training
programs conducted by organizations if such training includes rules of behavior. Organizations
can use electronic signatures for acknowledging rules of behavior. Related controls: AC-2, AC-6,

use of social media/networking sites: (i) when organizational personnel are using such sites
for official duties or in the conduct of official business; (ii) when organizational information
is involved in social media/networking transactions; and (iii) when personnel are accessing
social media/networking sites from organizational information systems. Organizations also

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

This control addresses actions taken by organizations in the design and
development of information systems. The information security architecture at the individual
information system level is consistent with and complements the more global, organization-wide
information security architecture described in PM-7 that is integral to and developed as part of the
enterprise architecture. The information security architecture includes an architectural description,
the placement/allocation of security functionality (including security controls), security-related
information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the
protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security architecture can
include other important security-related information, for example, user roles and access privileges
assigned to each role, unique security requirements, the types of information processed, stored,
and transmitted by the information system, restoration priorities of information and information
system services, and any other specific protection needs.
Supplemental Guidance:

In today’s modern architecture, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all
information resources. There are going to be key dependencies on external information services
and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is
important to developing a comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing,
developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline configuration
for organizational information systems is critical to implementing and maintaining an effective
information security architecture. The development of the information security architecture is
coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to
ensure that security controls needed to support privacy requirements are identified and effectively
implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure
that organizations develop an information security architecture for the information system, and
that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture
through the organization-wide information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily
directed at external information technology product/system developers and integrators (although
SA-17 could be used internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17,
which is complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of
information systems or information system components to external entities, and there is a need to
demonstrate/show consistency with the organization’s enterprise architecture and information
security architecture. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6, PL-2, PM-7, SA-5, SA-17, Appendix J.
Control Enhancements:

INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE | DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH

The organization designs its security architecture using a defense-in-depth approach that:
(a)

Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to [Assignment:
organization-defined locations and architectural layers]; and

(b) Ensures that the allocated security safeguards operate in a coordinated and mutually
reinforcing manner.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations strategically allocate security safeguards (procedural,
technical, or both) in the security architecture so that adversaries have to overcome multiple
safeguards to achieve their objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple mechanisms
makes it more difficult to successfully attack critical information resources (i.e., increases
adversary work factor) and also increases the likelihood of detection. The coordination of
allocated safeguards is essential to ensure that an attack that involves one safeguard does not
create adverse unintended consequences (e.g., lockout, cascading alarms) by interfering with
another safeguard. Placement of security safeguards is a key activity. Greater asset criticality
or information value merits additional layering. Thus, an organization may choose to place
anti-virus software at organizational boundary layers, email/web servers, notebook computers,
and workstations to maximize the number of related safeguards adversaries must penetrate
before compromising the information and information systems. Related controls: SC-29, SC36.

INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE | SUPPLIER DIVERSITY

The organization requires that [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] allocated to
[Assignment: organization-defined locations and architectural layers] are obtained from different
suppliers.

Different information technology products have different strengths and
weaknesses. Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual offerings.
For example, vendors offering malicious code protection typically update their products at
different times, often developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms according to
their priorities and development schedules. By having different products at different locations
(e.g., server, boundary, desktop) there is an increased likelihood that at least one will detect
the malicious code. Related control: SA-12.

CENTRAL MANAGEMENT
Control: The organization centrally manages [Assignment: organization-defined security controls
and related processes].
Supplemental Guidance: Central management refers to the organization-wide management and
implementation of selected security controls and related processes. Central management includes
planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally
managed security controls and processes. As central management of security controls is generally
associated with common controls, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of
security control implementations and management and judicious use of organizational resources.
Centrally-managed security controls and processes may also meet independence requirements for
assessments in support of initial and ongoing authorizations to operate as part of organizational
continuous monitoring. As part of the security control selection process, organizations determine
which controls may be suitable for central management based on organizational resources and
capabilities. Organizations consider that it may not always be possible to centrally manage every
aspect of a security control. In such cases, the security control is treated as a hybrid control with
the control managed and implemented either centrally or at the information system level. Controls
and control enhancements that are candidates for full or partial central management include, but
are not limited to: AC-2 (1) (2) (3) (4); AC-17 (1) (2) (3) (9); AC-18 (1) (3) (4) (5); AC-19 (4) (6)

Conducts an assessment of risk, including the likelihood and magnitude of harm, from the
unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the
information system and the information it processes, stores, or transmits;

b.

Documents risk assessment results in [Selection: security plan; risk assessment report;
[Assignment: organization-defined document]];

c.

e.

Updates the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or whenever there
are significant changes to the information system or environment of operation (including the
identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the
security state of the system.

Supplemental Guidance: Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective
risk assessments. Risk assessments take into account threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and
impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
based on the operation and use of information systems. Risk assessments also take into account
risk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on
behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing
entities). In accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of
public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or
privacy-related information. As such, organizational assessments of risk also address public access
to federal information systems.

Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk
management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information
system level) and at any phase in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be
conducted at various steps in the Risk Management Framework, including categorization, security
control selection, security control implementation, security control assessment, information
system authorization, and security control monitoring. RA-3 is noteworthy in that the control must
be partially implemented prior to the implementation of other controls in order to complete the
first two steps in the Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can play an important role
in security control selection processes, particularly during the application of tailoring guidance,
which includes security control supplementation. Related controls: RA-2, PM-9.

VULNERABILITY SCANNING
Control:

The organization:

a.

Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined
process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are
identified and reported;

b.

Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among
tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
1.

Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;

2.

Formatting checklists and test procedures; and

3.

Measuring vulnerability impact;

c.

Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;

d.

Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in
accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and

e.

Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control
assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate
similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or
deficiencies).

Security categorization of information systems guides the frequency and
comprehensiveness of vulnerability scans. Organizations determine the required vulnerability
scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities
such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for
custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic
analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these
analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis
tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example:
(i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should
not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly
operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express
vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that
use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of
vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness
Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security
control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities
for which to scan. Organizations also consider using tools that express vulnerability impact by the

A well-defined system development life cycle provides the foundation for
the successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems.
To apply the required security controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic
understanding of information security, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical
missions/business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 cannot be properly
applied if individuals that design, code, and test information systems and system components
(including information technology products) do not understand security. Therefore, organizations
include qualified personnel, for example, chief information security officers, security architects,
security engineers, and information system security officers in system development life cycle
activities to ensure that security requirements are incorporated into organizational information
systems. It is equally important that developers include individuals on the development team that
possess the requisite security expertise and skills to ensure that needed security capabilities are
effectively integrated into the information system. Security awareness and training programs can
help ensure that individuals having key security roles and responsibilities have the appropriate
experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities. The
effective integration of security requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that
important security considerations are addressed early in the system development life cycle and that
those considerations are directly related to the organizational mission/business processes. This
process also facilitates the integration of the information security architecture into the enterprise
architecture, consistent with organizational risk management and information security strategies.

Information system components are discrete, identifiable information
technology assets (e.g., hardware, software, or firmware) that represent the building blocks of an
information system. Information system components include commercial information technology
products. Security functional requirements include security capabilities, security functions, and
security mechanisms. Security strength requirements associated with such capabilities, functions,
and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness, resistance to direct attack, and
resistance to tampering or bypass. Security assurance requirements include: (i) development
processes, procedures, practices, and methodologies; and (ii) evidence from development and
assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the required security functionality has
been implemented and the required security strength has been achieved. Security documentation
requirements address all phases of the system development life cycle.

Supplemental Guidance:

Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed in terms of
security controls and control enhancements that have been selected through the tailoring process.
The security control tailoring process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values
through the use of assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform
dependencies and implementation information. Security documentation provides user and
administrator guidance regarding the implementation and operation of security controls. The level
of detail required in security documentation is based on the security category or classification level
of the information system and the degree to which organizations depend on the stated security
capability, functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined in the
organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements can also include organizationally
mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports, protocols, and services.
Acceptance criteria for information systems, information system components, and information
system services are defined in the same manner as such criteria for any organizational acquisition
or procurement. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information
security requirements from FISMA. Related controls: CM-6, PL-2, PS-7, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA11, SA-12.

ACQUISITION PROCESS | FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF SECURITY CONTROLS

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to provide a description of the functional properties of the security
controls to be employed.
Supplemental Guidance: Functional properties of security controls describe the functionality
(i.e., security capability, functions, or mechanisms) visible at the interfaces of the controls and
specifically exclude functionality and data structures internal to the operation of the controls.
Related control: SA-5.

ACQUISITION PROCESS | DESIGN / IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION FOR SECURITY CONTROLS

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to provide design and implementation information for the security
controls to be employed that includes: [Selection (one or more): security-relevant external system
interfaces; high-level design; low-level design; source code or hardware schematics; [Assignment:
organization-defined design/implementation information]] at [Assignment: organization-defined
level of detail].

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Organizations may require different levels of detail in design and
implementation documentation for security controls employed in organizational information
systems, system components, or information system services based on mission/business
requirements, requirements for trustworthiness/resiliency, and requirements for analysis and
testing. Information systems can be partitioned into multiple subsystems. Each subsystem
within the system can contain one or more modules. The high-level design for the system is
expressed in terms of multiple subsystems and the interfaces between subsystems providing
security-relevant functionality. The low-level design for the system is expressed in terms of
modules with particular emphasis on software and firmware (but not excluding hardware) and
the interfaces between modules providing security-relevant functionality. Source code and
hardware schematics are typically referred to as the implementation representation of the
information system. Related control: SA-5.

ACQUISITION PROCESS | DEVELOPMENT METHODS / TECHNIQUES / PRACTICES

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle that
includes [Assignment: organization-defined state-of-the-practice system/security engineering
methods, software development methods, testing/evaluation/validation techniques, and quality
control processes].
Supplemental Guidance: Following a well-defined system development life cycle that includes
state-of-the-practice software development methods, systems/security engineering methods,
quality control processes, and testing, evaluation, and validation techniques helps to reduce
the number and severity of latent errors within information systems, system components, and
information system services. Reducing the number/severity of such errors reduces the number
of vulnerabilities in those systems, components, and services. Related control: SA-12.

(a)

Deliver the system, component, or service with [Assignment: organization-defined security
configurations] implemented; and

(b) Use the configurations as the default for any subsequent system, component, or service
reinstallation or upgrade.

Security configurations include, for example, the U.S. Government
Configuration Baseline (USGCB) and any limitations on functions, ports, protocols, and
services. Security characteristics include, for example, requiring that all default passwords
have been changed. Related control: CM-8.

ACQUISITION PROCESS | USE OF INFORMATION ASSURANCE PRODUCTS

The organization:
(a)

Employs only government off-the-shelf (GOTS) or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
information assurance (IA) and IA-enabled information technology products that compose an
NSA-approved solution to protect classified information when the networks used to transmit
the information are at a lower classification level than the information being transmitted; and

(b) Ensures that these products have been evaluated and/or validated by NSA or in accordance
with NSA-approved procedures.
Supplemental Guidance: COTS IA or IA-enabled information technology products used to
protect classified information by cryptographic means may be required to use NSA-approved
key management. Related controls: SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.

ACQUISITION PROCESS | CONTINUOUS MONITORING PLAN
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to produce a plan for the continuous monitoring of security control
effectiveness that contains [Assignment: organization-defined level of detail].

The objective of continuous monitoring plans is to determine if the
complete set of planned, required, and deployed security controls within the information
system, system component, or information system service continue to be effective over time
based on the inevitable changes that occur. Developer continuous monitoring plans include a
sufficient level of detail such that the information can be incorporated into the continuous
monitoring strategies and programs implemented by organizations. Related control: CA-7.

Supplemental Guidance:

(9)

ACQUISITION PROCESS | FUNCTIONS / PORTS / PROTOCOLS / SERVICES IN USE

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to identify early in the system development life cycle, the functions,
ports, protocols, and services intended for organizational use.

The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services early in
the system development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements definition and design
phases) allows organizations to influence the design of the information system, information
system component, or information system service. This early involvement in the life cycle
helps organizations to avoid or minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that
pose unnecessarily high risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific
ports, protocols, or services (or when requiring information system service providers to do
so). Early identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services avoids costly retrofitting
of security controls after the information system, system component, or information system
service has been implemented. SA-9 describes requirements for external information system
services with organizations identifying which functions, ports, protocols, and services are
provided from external sources. Related controls: CM-7, SA-9.

b.

Obtains user documentation for the information system, system component, or information
system service that describes:
1.

User-accessible security functions/mechanisms and how to effectively use those security
functions/mechanisms;

2.

Methods for user interaction, which enables individuals to use the system, component, or
service in a more secure manner; and

3.

User responsibilities in maintaining the security of the system, component, or service;

c.

service documentation when such documentation is either unavailable or nonexistent and
[Assignment: organization-defined actions] in response;

d.

Protects documentation as required, in accordance with the risk management strategy; and

e.

Distributes documentation to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].

This control helps organizational personnel understand the implementation
and operation of security controls associated with information systems, system components, and
information system services. Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine
the quality/completeness of the content provided. The inability to obtain needed documentation
may occur, for example, due to the age of the information system/component or lack of support
from developers and contractors. In those situations, organizations may need to recreate selected
documentation if such documentation is essential to the effective implementation or operation of
security controls. The level of protection provided for selected information system, component, or
service documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system.
For example, documentation associated with a key DoD weapons system or command and control
system would typically require a higher level of protection than a routine administrative system.
Documentation that addresses information system vulnerabilities may also require an increased
level of protection. Secure operation of the information system, includes, for example, initially
starting the system and resuming secure system operation after any lapse in system operation.

SECURITY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES
Control: The organization applies information system security engineering principles in the
specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the information system.

Organizations apply security engineering principles primarily to new
development information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades. For legacy systems,
organizations apply security engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the
extent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware within those systems.
Security engineering principles include, for example: (i) developing layered protections; (ii)
establishing sound security policy, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design; (iii)
incorporating security requirements into the system development life cycle; (iv) delineating
physical and logical security boundaries; (v) ensuring that system developers are trained on how to
build secure software; (vi) tailoring security controls to meet organizational and operational needs;
(vii) performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors, and attack
patterns as well as compensating controls and design patterns needed to mitigate risk; and (viii)
reducing risk to acceptable levels, thus enabling informed risk management decisions. Related

EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SERVICES
Control:

The organization:

a.

Requires that providers of external information system services comply with organizational
information security requirements and employ [Assignment: organization-defined security
controls] in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
regulations, standards, and guidance;

b.

Defines and documents government oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard
to external information system services; and

c.

Employs [Assignment: organization-defined processes, methods, and techniques] to monitor
security control compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis.

Supplemental Guidance: External information system services are services that are implemented
outside of the authorization boundaries of organizational information systems. This includes
services that are used by, but not a part of, organizational information systems. FISMA and OMB
policy require that organizations using external service providers that are processing, storing, or
transmitting federal information or operating information systems on behalf of the federal
government ensure that such providers meet the same security requirements that federal agencies
are required to meet. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a
variety of ways including, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, contracts,
interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and supply chain
exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external information system
services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust
requires that organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating

provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection
for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the
relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis
for trust relationships so the relationships can be monitored over time. External information
system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and
responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define expectations of
performance for security controls, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and
response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance. Related controls: CA-3, IR-7,
PS-7.
Control Enhancements:

EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | RISK ASSESSMENTS / ORGANIZATIONAL APPROVALS

The organization:
(a)

Conducts an organizational assessment of risk prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of
dedicated information security services; and

(b) Ensures that the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services is
approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].

Dedicated information security services include, for example, incident
monitoring, analysis and response, operation of information security-related devices such as
firewalls, or key management services. Related controls: CA-6, RA-3.

Supplemental Guidance:

(2)

EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | IDENTIFICATION OF FUNCTIONS / PORTS / PROTOCOLS / SERVICES
The organization requires providers of [Assignment: organization-defined external information
system services] to identify the functions, ports, protocols, and other services required for the use
of such services.

Information from external service providers regarding the specific
functions, ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be
particularly useful when the need arises to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting
certain functions/services or blocking certain ports/protocols. Related control: CM-7.
Supplemental Guidance:

(3)

EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | ESTABLISH / MAINTAIN TRUST RELATIONSHIP WITH PROVIDERS

The organization establishes, documents, and maintains trust relationships with external service
providers based on [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements, properties, factors,
or conditions defining acceptable trust relationships].

The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is
at an acceptable level depends on the trust that organizations place in the external providers,
individually or in combination. Trust relationships can help organization to gain increased
levels of confidence that participating service providers are providing adequate protection for
the services rendered. Such relationships can be complicated due to the number of potential
entities participating in the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and
levels of trust, and the types of interactions between the parties. In some cases, the degree of
trust is based on the amount of direct control organizations are able to exert on external
service providers with regard to employment of security controls necessary for the protection
of the service/information and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those
controls. The level of control is typically established by the terms and conditions of the
contracts or service-level agreements and can range from extensive control (e.g., negotiating
contracts or agreements that specify security requirements for the providers) to very limited
control (e.g., using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain commodity services such as
commercial telecommunications services). In other cases, levels of trust are based on factors
that convince organizations that required security controls have been employed and that
determinations of control effectiveness exist. For example, separately authorized external
information system services provided to organizations through well-established business
relationships may provide degrees of trust in such services within the tolerable risk range of
the organizations using the services. External service providers may also outsource selected
services to other external entities, making the trust relationship more difficult and complicated
to manage. Depending on the nature of the services, organizations may find it very difficult to

place significant trust in external providers. This is not due to any inherent untrustworthiness
on the part of providers, but to the intrinsic level of risk in the services.
(4)

EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | CONSISTENT INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to ensure that
the interests of [Assignment: organization-defined external service providers] are consistent with
and reflect organizational interests.

Supplemental Guidance: As organizations increasingly use external service providers, the
possibility exists that the interests of the service providers may diverge from organizational
interests. In such situations, simply having the correct technical, procedural, or operational
safeguards in place may not be sufficient if the service providers that implement and control
those safeguards are not operating in a manner consistent with the interests of the consuming
organizations. Possible actions that organizations might take to address such concerns include,
for example, requiring background checks for selected service provider personnel, examining
ownership records, employing only trustworthy service providers (i.e., providers with which
organizations have had positive experiences), and conducting periodic/unscheduled visits to
service provider facilities.
(5)

EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | PROCESSING, STORAGE, AND SERVICE LOCATION

The organization restricts the location of [Selection (one or more): information processing;
information/data; information system services] to [Assignment: organization-defined locations]
based on [Assignment: organization-defined requirements or conditions].

The location of information processing, information/data storage, or
information system services that are critical to organizations can have a direct impact on the
ability of those organizations to successfully execute their missions/business functions. This
situation exists when external providers control the location of processing, storage or services.
The criteria external providers use for the selection of processing, storage, or service locations
may be different from organizational criteria. For example, organizations may want to ensure
that data/information storage locations are restricted to certain locations to facilitate incident
response activities (e.g., forensic analyses, after-the-fact investigations) in case of information
security breaches/compromises. Such incident response activities may be adversely affected
by the governing laws or protocols in the locations where processing and storage occur and/or
the locations from which information system services emanate.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: This control also applies to organizations conducting internal information
systems development and integration. Organizations consider the quality and completeness of the
configuration management activities conducted by developers as evidence of applying effective
security safeguards. Safeguards include, for example, protecting from unauthorized modification
or destruction, the master copies of all material used to generate security-relevant portions of the
system hardware, software, and firmware. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the information
system, information system component, or information system service requires configuration
control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent
unauthorized changes. Configuration items that are placed under configuration management (if
existence/use is required by other security controls) include: the formal model; the functional,
high-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation documentation;
source code and hardware schematics; the running version of the object code; tools for comparing
new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and software/firmware source code with
previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission/business needs
of organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide
configuration management support during the operations and maintenance phases of the life cycle.

DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | SOFTWARE / FIRMWARE INTEGRITY VERIFICATION
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to enable integrity verification of software and firmware components.

This control enhancement allows organizations to detect unauthorized
changes to software and firmware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or
mechanisms provided by developers. Integrity checking mechanisms can also address
counterfeiting of software and firmware components. Organizations verify the integrity of

DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PROCESSES

The organization provides an alternate configuration management process using organizational
personnel in the absence of a dedicated developer configuration management team.

Alternate configuration management processes may be required, for
example, when organizations use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information technology
products. Alternate configuration management processes include organizational personnel
that: (i) are responsible for reviewing/approving proposed changes to information systems,
system components, and information system services; and (ii) conduct security impact
analyses prior to the implementation of any changes to systems, components, or services (e.g.,
a configuration control board that considers security impacts of changes during development
and includes representatives of both the organization and the developer, when applicable).
Supplemental Guidance:

(3)

DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | HARDWARE INTEGRITY VERIFICATION

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to enable integrity verification of hardware components.

This control enhancement allows organizations to detect unauthorized
changes to hardware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or mechanisms
provided by developers. Organizations verify the integrity of hardware components, for
example, with hard-to-copy labels and verifiable serial numbers provided by developers, and
by requiring the implementation of anti-tamper technologies. Delivered hardware components
also include updates to such components. Related control: SI-7.
Supplemental Guidance:

version.

This control enhancement addresses changes to hardware, software,
and firmware components during initial development and during system life cycle updates.
Maintaining the integrity between the master copies of security-relevant hardware, software,
and firmware (including designs and source code) and the equivalent data in master copies
on-site in operational environments is essential to ensure the availability of organizational
information systems supporting critical missions and/or business functions.

DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | TRUSTED DISTRIBUTION

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to execute procedures for ensuring that security-relevant hardware,
software, and firmware updates distributed to the organization are exactly as specified by the
master copies.

The trusted distribution of security-relevant hardware, software, and
firmware updates helps to ensure that such updates are faithful representations of the master
copies maintained by the developer and have not been tampered with during distribution.

Create and implement a security assessment plan;

b.

Perform [Selection (one or more): unit; integration; system; regression] testing/evaluation at
[Assignment: organization-defined depth and coverage];

Developmental security testing/evaluation occurs at all post‐design phases
of the system development life cycle. Such testing/evaluation confirms that the required security
controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security policy,
and meeting established security requirements. Security properties of information systems may be
affected by the interconnection of system components or changes to those components. These
interconnections or changes (e.g., upgrading or replacing applications and operating systems) may
adversely affect previously implemented security controls. This control provides additional types
of security testing/evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws.
Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as static analysis, dynamic

analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Developers can employ these
analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis
tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Security assessment plans provide the specific
activities that developers plan to carry out including the types of analyses, testing, evaluation, and
reviews of software and firmware components, the degree of rigor to be applied, and the types of
artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of security testing/evaluation refers to the
rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process (e.g., black box, gray box, or white
box testing). The coverage of security testing/evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type)
of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for
security assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans/processes
have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence,
and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the
information system. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements. Related

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | STATIC CODE ANALYSIS

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and
document the results of the analysis.

Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for
security reviews. Such analysis can be used to identify security vulnerabilities and enforce
security coding practices. Static code analysis is most effective when used early in the
development process, when each code change can be automatically scanned for potential
weaknesses. Static analysis can provide clear remediation guidance along with defects to
enable developers to fix such defects. Evidence of correct implementation of static analysis
can include, for example, aggregate defect density for critical defect types, evidence that
defects were inspected by developers or security professionals, and evidence that defects were
fixed. An excessively high density of ignored findings (commonly referred to as ignored or
false positives) indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or tool. In such cases,
organizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from other sources.

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to perform threat and vulnerability analyses and subsequent
testing/evaluation of the as-built system, component, or service.

Applications may deviate significantly from the functional and design
specifications created during the requirements and design phases of the system development
life cycle. Therefore, threat and vulnerability analyses of information systems, system
components, and information system services prior to delivery are critical to the effective
operation of those systems, components, and services. Threat and vulnerability analyses at
this phase of the life cycle help to ensure that design or implementation changes have been
accounted for, and that any new vulnerabilities created as a result of those changes have been
reviewed and mitigated. Related controls: PM-15, RA-5.

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION OF ASSESSMENT PLANS /
EVIDENCE

The organization:
(a)

Requires an independent agent satisfying [Assignment: organization-defined independence
criteria] to verify the correct implementation of the developer security assessment plan and
the evidence produced during security testing/evaluation; and

(b) Ensures that the independent agent either is provided with sufficient information to complete
the verification process or has been granted the authority to obtain such information.

Independent agents have the necessary qualifications (i.e., expertise,
skills, training, and experience) to verify the correct implementation of developer security
assessment plans. Related controls: AT-3, CA-7, RA-5, SA-12.

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | MANUAL CODE REVIEWS

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to perform a manual code review of [Assignment: organization-defined
specific code] using [Assignment: organization-defined processes, procedures, and/or
techniques].
Supplemental Guidance: Manual code reviews are usually reserved for the critical software and
firmware components of information systems. Such code reviews are uniquely effective at
identifying weaknesses that require knowledge of the application’s requirements or context
which are generally unavailable to more automated analytic tools and techniques such as
static or dynamic analysis. Components benefiting from manual review include for example,
verifying access control matrices against application controls and reviewing more detailed
aspects of cryptographic implementations and controls.
(5)

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | PENETRATION TESTING / ANALYSIS

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to perform penetration testing at [Assignment: organization-defined
breadth/depth] and with [Assignment: organization-defined constraints].
Supplemental Guidance: Penetration testing is an assessment methodology in which assessors,
using all available information technology product and/or information system documentation
(e.g., product/system design specifications, source code, and administrator/operator manuals)
and working under specific constraints, attempt to circumvent implemented security features
of information technology products and information systems. Penetration testing can include,
for example, white, gray, or black box testing with analyses performed by skilled security
professionals simulating adversary actions. The objective of penetration testing is to uncover
potential vulnerabilities in information technology products and information systems resulting
from implementation errors, configuration faults, or other operational deployment weaknesses
or deficiencies. Penetration tests can be performed in conjunction with automated and manual
code reviews to provide greater levels of analysis than would ordinarily be possible.
(6)

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | ATTACK SURFACE REVIEWS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to perform attack surface reviews.

Attack surfaces of information systems are exposed areas that make
those systems more vulnerable to cyber attacks. This includes any accessible areas where
weaknesses or deficiencies in information systems (including the hardware, software, and
firmware components) provide opportunities for adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities. Attack
surface reviews ensure that developers: (i) analyze both design and implementation changes
to information systems; and (ii) mitigate attack vectors generated as a result of the changes.
Correction of identified flaws includes, for example, deprecation of unsafe functions.
Supplemental Guidance:

(7)

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | VERIFY SCOPE OF TESTING / EVALUATION
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to verify that the scope of security testing/evaluation provides
complete coverage of required security controls at [Assignment: organization-defined depth of
testing/evaluation].

Supplemental Guidance: Verifying that security testing/evaluation provides complete coverage
of required security controls can be accomplished by a variety of analytic techniques ranging
from informal to formal. Each of these techniques provides an increasing level of assurance
corresponding to the degree of formality of the analysis. Rigorously demonstrating security
control coverage at the highest levels of assurance can be provided by the use of formal
modeling and analysis techniques including correlation between control implementation and
corresponding test cases.
(8)

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | DYNAMIC CODE ANALYSIS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to employ dynamic code analysis tools to identify common flaws and
document the results of the analysis.

Dynamic code analysis provides run-time verification of software
programs, using tools capable of monitoring programs for memory corruption, user privilege

issues, and other potential security problems. Dynamic code analysis employs run-time tools
to help to ensure that security functionality performs in the manner in which it was designed.
A specialized type of dynamic analysis, known as fuzz testing, induces program failures by
deliberately introducing malformed or random data into software programs. Fuzz testing
strategies derive from the intended use of applications and the functional and design
specifications for the applications.

SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION
Control: The organization protects against supply chain threats to the information system, system
component, or information system service by employing [Assignment: organization-defined
security safeguards] as part of a comprehensive, defense-in-breadth information security strategy.

Information systems (including system components that compose those
systems) need to be protected throughout the system development life cycle (i.e., during design,
development, manufacturing, packaging, assembly, distribution, system integration, operations,
maintenance, and retirement). Protection of organizational information systems is accomplished
through threat awareness, by the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at
each phase of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to
respond to risk. Organizations consider implementing a standardized process to address supply
chain risk with respect to information systems and system components, and to educate the
acquisition workforce on threats, risk, and required security controls. Organizations use the
acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement necessary security
safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the supply
chain; and (ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking
delivery of such systems/components. This control enhancement also applies to information
system services. Security safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development
systems, development facilities, and external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting
development personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing.
Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, evidence, and documentation are
commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system.
Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements. Related controls: AT-3, CM-8, IR4, PE-16, PL-8, SA-3, SA-4, SA-8, SA-10, SA-14, SA-15, SA-18, SA-19, SC-29, SC-30, SC-38,

SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | ACQUISITION STRATEGIES / TOOLS / METHODS

The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined tailored acquisition strategies,
contract tools, and procurement methods] for the purchase of the information system, system
component, or information system service from suppliers.

The use of acquisition and procurement processes by organizations
early in the system development life cycle provides an important vehicle to protect the supply
chain. Organizations use available all-source intelligence analysis to inform the tailoring of
acquisition strategies, tools, and methods. There are a number of different tools and
techniques available (e.g., obscuring the end use of an information system or system
component, using blind or filtered buys). Organizations also consider creating incentives for
suppliers who: (i) implement required security safeguards; (ii) promote transparency into their
organizational processes and security practices; (iii) provide additional vetting of the
processes and security practices of subordinate suppliers, critical information system

components, and services; (iv) restrict purchases from specific suppliers or countries; and (v)
provide contract language regarding the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components. In
addition, organizations consider minimizing the time between purchase decisions and required
delivery to limit opportunities for adversaries to corrupt information system components or
products. Finally, organizations can use trusted/controlled distribution, delivery, and
warehousing options to reduce supply chain risk (e.g., requiring tamper-evident packaging of
information system components during shipping and warehousing). Related control: SA-19.
(2)

SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | SUPPLIER REVIEWS

The organization conducts a supplier review prior to entering into a contractual agreement to
acquire the information system, system component, or information system service.

Supplier reviews include, for example: (i) analysis of supplier
processes used to design, develop, test, implement, verify, deliver, and support information
systems, system components, and information system services; and (ii) assessment of supplier
training and experience in developing systems, components, or services with the required
security capability. These reviews provide organizations with increased levels of visibility
into supplier activities during the system development life cycle to promote more effective
supply chain risk management. Supplier reviews can also help to determine whether primary
suppliers have security safeguards in place and a practice for vetting subordinate suppliers, for
example, second- and third-tier suppliers, and any subcontractors.

The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to limit harm
from potential adversaries identifying and targeting the organizational supply chain.
Supplemental Guidance: Supply chain risk is part of the advanced persistent threat (APT).
Security safeguards and countermeasures to reduce the probability of adversaries successfully
identifying and targeting the supply chain include, for example: (i) avoiding the purchase of
custom configurations to reduce the risk of acquiring information systems, components, or
products that have been corrupted via supply chain actions targeted at specific organizations;
(ii) employing a diverse set of suppliers to limit the potential harm from any given supplier in
the supply chain; (iii) employing approved vendor lists with standing reputations in industry,
and (iv) using procurement carve outs (i.e., exclusions to commitments or obligations).

SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | ASSESSMENTS PRIOR TO SELECTION / ACCEPTANCE / UPDATE
The organization conducts an assessment of the information system, system component, or
information system service prior to selection, acceptance, or update.

Assessments include, for example, testing, evaluations, reviews, and
analyses. Independent, third-party entities or organizational personnel conduct assessments of
systems, components, products, tools, and services. Organizations conduct assessments to
uncover unintentional vulnerabilities and intentional vulnerabilities including, for example,
malicious code, malicious processes, defective software, and counterfeits. Assessments can
include, for example, static analyses, dynamic analyses, simulations, white, gray, and black
box testing, fuzz testing, penetration testing, and ensuring that components or services are
genuine (e.g., using tags, cryptographic hash verifications, or digital signatures). Evidence
generated during security assessments is documented for follow-on actions carried out by
organizations. Related controls: CA-2, SA-11.

SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | USE OF ALL-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE

The organization uses all-source intelligence analysis of suppliers and potential suppliers of the
information system, system component, or information system service.

APPENDIX F-SA

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: All-source intelligence analysis is employed by organizations to
inform engineering, acquisition, and risk management decisions. All-source intelligence
consists of intelligence products and/or organizations and activities that incorporate all
sources of information, most frequently including human intelligence, imagery intelligence,
measurement and signature intelligence, signals intelligence, and open source data in the
production of finished intelligence. Where available, such information is used to analyze the
risk of both intentional and unintentional vulnerabilities from development, manufacturing,
and delivery processes, people, and the environment. This review is performed on suppliers at
multiple tiers in the supply chain sufficient to manage risks. Related control: SA-15.
(9)

SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | OPERATIONS SECURITY

The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined Operations Security (OPSEC)
safeguards] in accordance with classification guides to protect supply chain-related information
for the information system, system component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: Supply chain information includes, for example: user identities; uses
for information systems, information system components, and information system services;
supplier identities; supplier processes; security requirements; design specifications; testing
and evaluation results; and system/component configurations. This control enhancement
expands the scope of OPSEC to include suppliers and potential suppliers. OPSEC is a process
of identifying critical information and subsequently analyzing friendly actions attendant to
operations and other activities to: (i) identify those actions that can be observed by potential
adversaries; (ii) determine indicators that adversaries might obtain that could be interpreted or
pieced together to derive critical information in sufficient time to cause harm to organizations;
(iii) implement safeguards or countermeasures to eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level,
exploitable vulnerabilities; and (iv) consider how aggregated information may compromise
the confidentiality of users or uses of the supply chain. OPSEC may require organizations to
withhold critical mission/business information from suppliers and may include the use of
intermediaries to hide the end use, or users, of information systems, system components, or
information system services. Related control: PE-21.
(10) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | VALIDATE AS GENUINE AND NOT ALTERED
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to validate that
the information system or system component received is genuine and has not been altered.

For some information system components, especially hardware, there
are technical means to help determine if the components are genuine or have been altered.
Security safeguards used to validate the authenticity of information systems and information
system components include, for example, optical/nanotechnology tagging and side-channel
analysis. For hardware, detailed bill of material information can highlight the elements with
embedded logic complete with component and production location.
Supplemental Guidance:

(11) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | PENETRATION TESTING / ANALYSIS OF ELEMENTS, PROCESSES, AND ACTORS
The organization employs [Selection (one or more): organizational analysis, independent thirdparty analysis, organizational penetration testing, independent third-party penetration testing] of
[Assignment: organization-defined supply chain elements, processes, and actors] associated with
the information system, system component, or information system service.

This control enhancement addresses analysis and/or testing of the
supply chain, not just delivered items. Supply chain elements are information technology
products or product components that contain programmable logic and that are critically
important to information system functions. Supply chain processes include, for example: (i)
hardware, software, and firmware development processes; (ii) shipping/handling procedures;
(iii) personnel and physical security programs; (iv) configuration management tools/measures
to maintain provenance; or (v) any other programs, processes, or procedures associated with
the production/distribution of supply chain elements. Supply chain actors are individuals with
specific roles and responsibilities in the supply chain. The evidence generated during analyses
and testing of supply chain elements, processes, and actors is documented and used to inform
organizational risk management activities and decisions. Related control: RA-5.

(12) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | INTER-ORGANIZATIONAL AGREEMENTS
The organization establishes inter-organizational agreements and procedures with entities
involved in the supply chain for the information system, system component, or information system
service.
Supplemental Guidance: The establishment of inter-organizational agreements and procedures
provides for notification of supply chain compromises. Early notification of supply chain
compromises that can potentially adversely affect or have adversely affected organizational
information systems, including critical system components, is essential for organizations to
provide appropriate responses to such incidents.
(13) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | CRITICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to ensure an
adequate supply of [Assignment: organization-defined critical information system components].

Adversaries can attempt to impede organizational operations by
disrupting the supply of critical information system components or corrupting supplier
operations. Safeguards to ensure adequate supplies of critical information system components
include, for example: (i) the use of multiple suppliers throughout the supply chain for the
identified critical components; and (ii) stockpiling of spare components to ensure operation
during mission-critical times.

Supplemental Guidance:

(14) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | IDENTITY AND TRACEABILITY
The organization establishes and retains unique identification of [Assignment: organizationdefined supply chain elements, processes, and actors] for the information system, system
component, or information system service.

Knowing who and what is in the supply chains of organizations is
critical to gaining visibility into what is happening within such supply chains, as well as
monitoring and identifying high-risk events and activities. Without reasonable visibility and
traceability into supply chains (i.e., elements, processes, and actors), it is very difficult for
organizations to understand and therefore manage risk, and to reduce the likelihood of adverse
events. Uniquely identifying acquirer and integrator roles, organizations, personnel, mission
and element processes, testing and evaluation procedures, delivery mechanisms, support
mechanisms, communications/delivery paths, and disposal/final disposition activities as well
as the components and tools used, establishes a foundational identity structure for assessment
of supply chain activities. For example, labeling (using serial numbers) and tagging (using
radio-frequency identification [RFID] tags) individual supply chain elements including
software packages, modules, and hardware devices, and processes associated with those
elements can be used for this purpose. Identification methods are sufficient to support the
provenance in the event of a supply chain issue or adverse supply chain event.
Supplemental Guidance:

(15) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | PROCESSES TO ADDRESS WEAKNESSES OR DEFICIENCIES
The organization establishes a process to address weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain
elements identified during independent or organizational assessments of such elements.

Evidence generated during independent or organizational assessments
of supply chain elements (e.g., penetration testing, audits, verification/validation activities) is
documented and used in follow-on processes implemented by organizations to respond to the
risks related to the identified weaknesses and deficiencies. Supply chain elements include, for
example, supplier development processes and supplier distribution systems.

TRUSTWORTHINESS
Control:

The organization:

a.

Describes the trustworthiness required in the [Assignment: organization-defined information
system, information system component, or information system service] supporting its critical
missions/business functions; and

b.

Implements [Assignment: organization-defined assurance overlay] to achieve such
trustworthiness.

Supplemental Guidance: This control helps organizations to make explicit trustworthiness decisions
when designing, developing, and implementing information systems that are needed to conduct
critical organizational missions/business functions. Trustworthiness is a characteristic/property of
an information system that expresses the degree to which the system can be expected to preserve
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information it processes, stores, or transmits.
Trustworthy information systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within
defined levels of risk despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks
that are expected to occur in the specified environments of operation. Trustworthy systems are
important to mission/business success. Two factors affecting the trustworthiness of information
systems include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the security features, functions, and/or mechanisms
employed within the system and its environment of operation); and (ii) security assurance (i.e., the
grounds for confidence that the security functionality is effective in its application). Developers,
implementers, operators, and maintainers of organizational information systems can increase the
level of assurance (and trustworthiness), for example, by employing well-defined security policy
models, structured and rigorous hardware, software, and firmware development techniques, sound
system/security engineering principles, and secure configuration settings (defined by a set of
assurance-related security controls in Appendix E).

Assurance is also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the system development
life cycle. Critical missions/business functions are supported by high-impact systems and the
associated assurance requirements for such systems. The additional assurance controls in Table E4 in Appendix E (designated as optional) can be used to develop and implement high-assurance
solutions for specific information systems and system components using the concept of overlays
described in Appendix I. Organizations select assurance overlays that have been developed,
validated, and approved for community adoption (e.g., cross-organization, governmentwide),
limiting the development of such overlays on an organization-by-organization basis. Organizations
can conduct criticality analyses as described in SA-14, to determine the information systems,
system components, or information system services that require high-assurance solutions.
Trustworthiness requirements and assurance overlays can be described in the security plans for
organizational information systems. Related controls: RA-2, SA-4, SA-8, SA-14, SC-3.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: Criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and
informs the prioritization of supply chain protection activities such as attack surface reduction, use
of all-source intelligence, and tailored acquisition strategies. Information system engineers can
conduct an end-to-end functional decomposition of an information system to identify missioncritical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of
core organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to
perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that
implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within
and beyond the information system boundary. Information system components that allow for
unmediated access to critical components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent
vulnerabilities such components create. Criticality is assessed in terms of the impact of the
function or component failure on the ability of the component to complete the organizational
missions supported by the information system. A criticality analysis is performed whenever an
architecture or design is being developed or modified, including upgrades. Related controls: CP-2,

Development tools include, for example, programming languages and
computer-aided design (CAD) systems. Reviews of development processes can include, for
example, the use of maturity models to determine the potential effectiveness of such processes.
Maintaining the integrity of changes to tools and processes enables accurate supply chain risk
assessment and mitigation, and requires robust configuration control throughout the life cycle

Organizations use quality metrics to establish minimum acceptable
levels of information system quality. Metrics may include quality gates which are collections
of completion criteria or sufficiency standards representing the satisfactory execution of
particular phases of the system development project. A quality gate, for example, may require
the elimination of all compiler warnings or an explicit determination that the warnings have
no impact on the effectiveness of required security capabilities. During the execution phases
of development projects, quality gates provide clear, unambiguous indications of progress.
Other metrics apply to the entire development project. These metrics can include defining the

DEVELOPER-PROVIDED TRAINING
Control: The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to provide [Assignment: organization-defined training] on the correct
use and operation of the implemented security functions, controls, and/or mechanisms.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to external and internal (in-house) developers. Training
of personnel is an essential element to ensure the effectiveness of security controls implemented
within organizational information systems. Training options include, for example, classroom-style
training, web-based/computer-based training, and hands-on training. Organizations can also
request sufficient training materials from developers to conduct in-house training or offer selftraining to organizational personnel. Organizations determine the type of training necessary and
may require different types of training for different security functions, controls, or mechanisms.

DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN
Control: The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to produce a design specification and security architecture that:

a.

Is consistent with and supportive of the organization’s security architecture which is
established within and is an integrated part of the organization’s enterprise architecture;

b.

Accurately and completely describes the required security functionality, and the allocation of
security controls among physical and logical components; and

c.

Expresses how individual security functions, mechanisms, and services work together to
provide required security capabilities and a unified approach to protection.

Supplemental Guidance: This control is primarily directed at external developers, although it could
also be used for internal (in-house) development. In contrast, PL-8 is primarily directed at internal
developers to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture and such
security architecture is integrated or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. This distinction
is important if/when organizations outsource the development of information systems, information
system components, or information system services to external entities, and there is a requirement
to demonstrate consistency with the organization’s enterprise architecture and information security
architecture. Related controls: PL-8, PM-7, SA-3, SA-8.

DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | FORMAL POLICY MODEL

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to:

________________________________________________________________________________________________
(a)

Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal policy model describing the
[Assignment: organization-defined elements of organizational security policy] to be enforced;
and

(b) Prove that the formal policy model is internally consistent and sufficient to enforce the
defined elements of the organizational security policy when implemented.

Formal models describe specific behaviors or security policies using
formal languages, thus enabling the correctness of those behaviors/policies to be formally
proven. Not all components of information systems can be modeled, and generally, formal
specifications are scoped to specific behaviors or policies of interest (e.g., nondiscretionary
access control policies). Organizations choose the particular formal modeling language and
approach based on the nature of the behaviors/policies to be described and the available tools.
Formal modeling tools include, for example, Gypsy and Zed.
Supplemental Guidance:

DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | SECURITY-RELEVANT COMPONENTS

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to:
(a)

Define security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and

(b) Provide a rationale that the definition for security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware is
complete.
Supplemental Guidance: Security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware represent the
portion of the information system, component, or service that must be trusted to perform
correctly in order to maintain required security properties. Related control: SA-5.
(3)

DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | FORMAL CORRESPONDENCE
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to:

(a)

Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal top-level specification that
specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of
exceptions, error messages, and effects;

(b) Show via proof to the extent feasible with additional informal demonstration as necessary,
that the formal top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;
(c)

Show via informal demonstration, that the formal top-level specification completely covers the
interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;

(d) Show that the formal top-level specification is an accurate description of the implemented
security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and
(e)

Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed
in the formal top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware,
software, and firmware.

Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained through
modeling. It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation of the model,
and that any additional code or implementation details present have no impact on the
behaviors or policies being modeled. Formal methods can be used to show that the high-level
security properties are satisfied by the formal information system description, and that the
formal system description is correctly implemented by a description of some lower level, for
example a hardware description. Consistency between the formal top-level specification and
the formal policy models is generally not amenable to being fully proven. Therefore, a
combination of formal/informal methods may be needed to show such consistency.
Consistency between the formal top-level specification and the implementation may require
the use of an informal demonstration due to limitations in the applicability of formal methods
to prove that the specification accurately reflects the implementation. Hardware, software, and
firmware mechanisms strictly internal to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware
include, for example, mapping registers and direct memory input/output. Related control: SA5.

feasible] that the descriptive top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;
(c)

Show via informal demonstration, that the descriptive top-level specification completely
covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;

TAMPER RESISTANCE AND DETECTION | MULTIPLE PHASES OF SDLC

The organization employs anti-tamper technologies and techniques during multiple phases in the
system development life cycle including design, development, integration, operations, and
maintenance.

Organizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques
for tamper resistance and detection. Organizations employ obfuscation and self-checking, for
example, to make reverse engineering and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and
expensive for adversaries. Customization of information systems and system components can
make substitutions easier to detect and therefore limit damage. Related control: SA-3.

detect tampering.

This control enhancement addresses both physical and logical
tampering and is typically applied to mobile devices, notebook computers, or other system

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations determine that certain information system components likely
cannot be trusted due to specific threats to and vulnerabilities in those components, and for which
there are no viable security controls to adequately mitigate the resulting risk. Re-implementation
or custom development of such components helps to satisfy requirements for higher assurance.
This is accomplished by initiating changes to system components (including hardware, software,
and firmware) such that the standard attacks by adversaries are less likely to succeed. In situations
where no alternative sourcing is available and organizations choose not to re-implement or custom
develop critical information system components, additional safeguards can be employed (e.g.,
enhanced auditing, restrictions on source code and system utility access, and protection from
deletion of system and application files. Related controls: CP-2, SA-8, SA-14.

Satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined additional personnel screening criteria].

Because the information system, system component, or information system
service may be employed in critical activities essential to the national and/or economic security
interests of the United States, organizations have a strong interest in ensuring that the developer is
trustworthy. The degree of trust required of the developer may need to be consistent with that of
the individuals accessing the information system/component/service once deployed. Examples of
authorization and personnel screening criteria include clearance, satisfactory background checks,
citizenship, and nationality. Trustworthiness of developers may also include a review and analysis
of company ownership and any relationships the company has with entities potentially affecting
the quality/reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed. Related controls:

Provides justification and documents approval for the continued use of unsupported system
components required to satisfy mission/business needs.

Support for information system components includes, for example,
software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. Unsupported
components (e.g., when vendors are no longer providing critical software patches), provide a
substantial opportunity for adversaries to exploit new weaknesses discovered in the currently
installed components. Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components may include, for
example, systems that provide critical mission/business capability where newer technologies are

This control enhancement addresses the need to provide continued
support for selected information system components that are no longer supported by the
original developers, vendors, or manufacturers when such components remain essential to
mission/business operations. Organizations can establish in-house support, for example, by
developing customized patches for critical software components or secure the services of
external providers who through contractual relationships, provide ongoing support for the

SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION CONTROLS
DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, AND SERVICES

With the renewed emphasis on trustworthy information systems and supply chain security, it is
essential that organizations have the capability to express their information security requirements
with clarity and specificity in order to engage the information technology industry and obtain the
systems, components, and services necessary for mission and business success. To ensure that
organizations have such capability, this publication provides a set of security controls in the System
and Services Acquisition family (i.e., SA family) addressing requirements for the development of
information systems, information technology products, and information system services. Therefore,
many of the controls in the SA family are directed at developers of those systems, components, and
services. It is important for organizations to recognize that the scope of the security controls in the
SA family includes all system/component/service development and the developers associated with
such development whether the development is conducted by internal organizational personnel or by
external developers through the contracting/acquisition process. Affected controls include SA-8,
SA-10, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-20, and SA-21.

effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the SC family.
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

APPLICATION PARTITIONING

The information system separates user functionality (including user interface services)
from information system management functionality.

Control:

Information system management functionality includes, for example,
functions necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and
typically requires privileged user access. The separation of user functionality from information
system management functionality is either physical or logical. Organizations implement separation
of system management-related functionality from user functionality by using different computers,
different central processing units, different instances of operating systems, different network
addresses, virtualization techniques, or combinations of these or other methods, as appropriate.
This type of separation includes, for example, web administrative interfaces that use separate
authentication methods for users of any other information system resources. Separation of system
and user functionality may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains and
with additional access controls. Related controls: SA-4, SA-8, SC-3.

This control enhancement ensures that administration options (e.g.,
administrator privileges) are not available to general users (including prohibiting the use of
the grey-out option commonly used to eliminate accessibility to such information). Such

SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION
Control:

The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions.

The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity
functions by means of an isolation boundary (implemented via partitions and domains). Such
isolation controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that
perform those security functions. Information systems implement code separation (i.e., separation
of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including, for example,
through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel
code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to
protect the code on disk, and address space protections that protect executing code. Information
systems restrict access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by
implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal is for all of the code within the security
function isolation boundary to only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to
include nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundary as an exception. Related controls: AC3, AC-6, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-13, SC-2, SC-7, SC-39.

Supplemental Guidance:

Control Enhancements:
(1)

SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | HARDWARE SEPARATION

The information system utilizes underlying hardware separation mechanisms to implement
security function isolation.

Underlying hardware separation mechanisms include, for example,
hardware ring architectures, commonly implemented within microprocessors, and hardwareenforced address segmentation used to support logically distinct storage objects with separate
attributes (i.e., readable, writeable).

Supplemental Guidance:

(2)

SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | ACCESS / FLOW CONTROL FUNCTIONS

The information system isolates security functions enforcing access and information flow control
from nonsecurity functions and from other security functions.

Security function isolation occurs as a result of implementation; the
functions can still be scanned and monitored. Security functions that are potentially isolated
from access and flow control enforcement functions include, for example, auditing, intrusion
detection, and anti-virus functions.

Supplemental Guidance:

(3)

SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | MINIMIZE NONSECURITY FUNCTIONALITY

The organization minimizes the number of nonsecurity functions included within the isolation
boundary containing security functions.

In those instances where it is not feasible to achieve strict isolation of
nonsecurity functions from security functions, it is necessary to take actions to minimize the
nonsecurity-relevant functions within the security function boundary. Nonsecurity functions

APPENDIX F-SC

and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

contained within the isolation boundary are considered security-relevant because errors or
maliciousness in such software, by virtue of being within the boundary, can impact the
security functions of organizational information systems. The design objective is that the
specific portions of information systems providing information security are of minimal
size/complexity. Minimizing the number of nonsecurity functions in the security-relevant
components of information systems allows designers and implementers to focus only on those
functions which are necessary to provide the desired security capability (typically access
enforcement). By minimizing nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundaries, the
amount of code that must be trusted to enforce security policies is reduced, thus contributing
to understandability.
(4)

SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | MODULE COUPLING AND COHESIVENESS

The organization implements security functions as largely independent modules that maximize
internal cohesiveness within modules and minimize coupling between modules.

The reduction in inter-module interactions helps to constrain security
functions and to manage complexity. The concepts of coupling and cohesion are important
with respect to modularity in software design. Coupling refers to the dependencies that one
module has on other modules. Cohesion refers to the relationship between the different
functions within a particular module. Good software engineering practices rely on modular
decomposition, layering, and minimization to reduce and manage complexity, thus producing
software modules that are highly cohesive and loosely coupled.

Supplemental Guidance:

(5)

SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | LAYERED STRUCTURES

The organization implements security functions as a layered structure minimizing interactions
between layers of the design and avoiding any dependence by lower layers on the functionality or
correctness of higher layers.

The implementation of layered structures with minimized interactions
among security functions and non-looping layers (i.e., lower-layer functions do not depend on
higher-layer functions) further enables the isolation of security functions and management of
complexity.

INFORMATION IN SHARED RESOURCES

The information system prevents unauthorized and unintended information transfer via
shared system resources.

Control:

This control prevents information, including encrypted representations of
information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on
behalf of prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or current processes)
that obtain access to shared system resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those
resources have been released back to information systems. The control of information in shared
resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection. This
control does not address: (i) information remanence which refers to residual representation of data
that has been nominally erased or removed; (ii) covert channels (including storage and/or timing
channels) where shared resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or (iii)
components within information systems for which there are only single users/roles. Related

DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION

The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following types of
denial of service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined types of denial of service attacks or
reference to source for such information] by employing [Assignment: organization-defined
security safeguards].

Control:

A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the
effects of denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain
types of packets to protect information system components on internal organizational networks
from being directly affected by denial of service attacks. Employing increased capacity and
bandwidth combined with service redundancy may also reduce the susceptibility to denial of
service attacks. Related controls: SC-6, SC-7.

Supplemental Guidance:

Control Enhancements:
(1)

DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION | RESTRICT INTERNAL USERS

The information system restricts the ability of individuals to launch [Assignment: organizationdefined denial of service attacks] against other information systems.
Supplemental Guidance:

Restricting the ability of individuals to launch denial of service attacks
requires that the mechanisms used for such attacks are unavailable. Individuals of concern can
include, for example, hostile insiders or external adversaries that have successfully breached
the information system and are using the system as a platform to launch cyber attacks on third
parties. Organizations can restrict the ability of individuals to connect and transmit arbitrary
information on the transport medium (i.e., network, wireless spectrum). Organizations can
also limit the ability of individuals to use excessive information system resources. Protection
against individuals having the ability to launch denial of service attacks may be implemented
on specific information systems or on boundary devices prohibiting egress to potential target
systems.

(2)

DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION | EXCESS CAPACITY / BANDWIDTH / REDUNDANCY

The information system manages excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the
effects of information flooding denial of service attacks.
Supplemental Guidance: Managing excess capacity ensures that sufficient capacity is available

sufficient resources exist to prevent effective denial of service attacks.

Organizations consider utilization and capacity of information system
resources when managing risk from denial of service due to malicious attacks. Denial of
service attacks can originate from external or internal sources. Information system resources
sensitive to denial of service include, for example, physical disk storage, memory, and CPU
cycles. Common safeguards to prevent denial of service attacks related to storage utilization
and capacity include, for example, instituting disk quotas, configuring information systems to
automatically alert administrators when specific storage capacity thresholds are reached, using
file compression technologies to maximize available storage space, and imposing separate
partitions for system and user data. Related controls: CA-7, SI-4.

BOUNDARY PROTECTION
Control:

The information system:

a.

Monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system and at key
internal boundaries within the system;

b.

Implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are [Selection:
physically; logically] separated from internal organizational networks; and

c.

Connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces
consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational
security architecture.

Managed interfaces include, for example, gateways, routers, firewalls,
guards, network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels
implemented within a security architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application
gateways residing on protected subnetworks). Subnetworks that are physically or logically
separated from internal networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or
prohibiting interfaces within organizational information systems includes, for example, restricting
external web traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external

commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls associated
with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on
network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial
customers, and may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements.
Such transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security
provisions. Related controls: AC-4, AC-17, CA-3, CM-7, CP-8, IR-4, RA-3, SC-5, SC-13.

BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ACCESS POINTS

The organization limits the number of external network connections to the information system.

Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates more

Internet Connection (TIC) initiative is an example of limiting the number of external network
connections.

BOUNDARY PROTECTION | EXTERNAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES

The organization:
(a)

Implements a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;

(b) Establishes a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;
(c)

Protects the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each
interface;

(d) Documents each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission/business need
and duration of that need; and

BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DENY BY DEFAULT / ALLOW BY EXCEPTION

The information system at managed interfaces denies network communications traffic by default
and allows network communications traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).

network communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications
traffic policy ensures that only those connections which are essential and approved are
allowed.

BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT SPLIT TUNNELING FOR REMOTE DEVICES
The information system, in conjunction with a remote device, prevents the device from
simultaneously establishing non-remote connections with the system and communicating via
some other connection to resources in external networks.

This control enhancement is implemented within remote devices (e.g.,
notebook computers) through configuration settings to disable split tunneling in those devices,
and by preventing those configuration settings from being readily configurable by users. This
control enhancement is implemented within the information system by the detection of split
tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by
prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. Split tunneling might
be desirable by remote users to communicate with local information system resources such as
printers/file servers. However, split tunneling would in effect allow unauthorized external
connections, making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational

information. The use of VPNs for remote connections, when adequately provisioned with
appropriate security controls, may provide the organization with sufficient assurance that it
can effectively treat such connections as non-remote connections from the confidentiality and
integrity perspective. VPNs thus provide a means for allowing non-remote communications
paths from remote devices. The use of an adequately provisioned VPN does not eliminate the
need for preventing split tunneling.

BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ROUTE TRAFFIC TO AUTHENTICATED PROXY SERVERS

The information system routes [Assignment: organization-defined internal communications traffic]
to [Assignment: organization-defined external networks] through authenticated proxy servers at
managed interfaces.

External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A
proxy server is a server (i.e., information system or application) that acts as an intermediary
for clients requesting information system resources (e.g., files, connections, web pages, or
services) from other organizational servers. Client requests established through an initial
connection to the proxy server are evaluated to manage complexity and to provide additional
protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of the most
common proxy servers providing access to the Internet. Proxy servers support logging
individual Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sessions and blocking specific Uniform
Resource Locators (URLs), domain names, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Web proxies
can be configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites.
Related controls: AC-3, AU-2.

Supplemental Guidance:

BOUNDARY PROTECTION | RESTRICT THREATENING OUTGOING COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC

The information system:
(a)

Detects and denies outgoing communications traffic posing a threat to external information
systems; and

(b) Audits the identity of internal users associated with denied communications.

Detecting outgoing communications traffic from internal actions that
may pose threats to external information systems is sometimes termed extrusion detection.
Extrusion detection at information system boundaries as part of managed interfaces includes
the analysis of incoming and outgoing communications traffic searching for indications of
internal threats to the security of external systems. Such threats include, for example, traffic
indicative of denial of service attacks and traffic containing malicious code. Related controls:
AU-2, AU-6, SC-38, SC-44, SI-3, SI-4.
Supplemental Guidance:

(10) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED EXFILTRATION
The organization prevents the unauthorized exfiltration of information across managed interfaces.

Safeguards implemented by organizations to prevent unauthorized
exfiltration of information from information systems include, for example: (i) strict adherence
to protocol formats; (ii) monitoring for beaconing from information systems; (iii) monitoring
for steganography; (iv) disconnecting external network interfaces except when explicitly
needed; (v) disassembling and reassembling packet headers; and (vi) employing traffic profile
analysis to detect deviations from the volume/types of traffic expected within organizations or
call backs to command and control centers. Devices enforcing strict adherence to protocol
formats include, for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. These
devices verify adherence to protocol formats and specification at the application layer and
serve to identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network or
transport layers. This control enhancement is closely associated with cross-domain solutions
and system guards enforcing information flow requirements. Related control: SI-3.

Supplemental Guidance:

(11) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | RESTRICT INCOMING COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC
The information system only allows incoming communications from [Assignment: organizationdefined authorized sources] routed to [Assignment: organization-defined authorized destinations].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement provides determinations that source and
destination address pairs represent authorized/allowed communications. Such determinations
can be based on several factors including, for example, the presence of source/destination

address pairs in lists of authorized/allowed communications, the absence of address pairs in
lists of unauthorized/disallowed pairs, or meeting more general rules for authorized/allowed
source/destination pairs. Related control: AC-3.
(12) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | HOST-BASED PROTECTION
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined host-based boundary protection
mechanisms] at [Assignment: organization-defined information system components].

Host-based boundary protection mechanisms include, for example,
host-based firewalls. Information system components employing host-based boundary
protection mechanisms include, for example, servers, workstations, and mobile devices.

Supplemental Guidance:

(13) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ISOLATION OF SECURITY TOOLS / MECHANISMS / SUPPORT COMPONENTS
The organization isolates [Assignment: organization-defined information security tools,
mechanisms, and support components] from other internal information system components by
implementing physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces to other components of
the system.

Physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces are useful,
for example, in isolating computer network defenses from critical operational processing
networks to prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and forensics techniques of
organizations. Related controls: SA-8, SC-2, SC-3.

Supplemental Guidance:

(14) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PROTECTS AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED PHYSICAL CONNECTIONS
The organization protects against unauthorized physical connections at [Assignment:
organization-defined managed interfaces].

Information systems operating at different security categories or
classification levels may share common physical and environmental controls, since the
systems may share space within organizational facilities. In practice, it is possible that these
separate information systems may share common equipment rooms, wiring closets, and cable
distribution paths. Protection against unauthorized physical connections can be achieved, for
example, by employing clearly identified and physically separated cable trays, connection
frames, and patch panels for each side of managed interfaces with physical access controls
enforcing limited authorized access to these items. Related controls: PE-4, PE-19.

Supplemental Guidance:

(15) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ROUTE PRIVILEGED NETWORK ACCESSES
The information system routes all networked, privileged accesses through a dedicated, managed
interface for purposes of access control and auditing.
Supplemental Guidance:

Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AU-2, SI-4.

(16) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT DISCOVERY OF COMPONENTS / DEVICES
The information system prevents discovery of specific system components composing a managed
interface.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement protects network addresses of information
system components that are part of managed interfaces from discovery through common tools
and techniques used to identify devices on networks. Network addresses are not available for
discovery (e.g., network address not published or entered in domain name systems), requiring
prior knowledge for access. Another obfuscation technique is to periodically change network
addresses.
(17) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT OF PROTOCOL FORMATS
The information system enforces adherence to protocol formats.

Information system components that enforce protocol formats include,
for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. Such system components
verify adherence to protocol formats/specifications (e.g., IEEE) at the application layer and
identify significant vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network
or transport layers. Related control: SC-4.
Supplemental Guidance:

(18) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | FAIL SECURE
The information system fails securely in the event of an operational failure of a boundary
protection device.

APPENDIX F-SC

PAGE F-191

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Fail secure is a condition achieved by employing information system
mechanisms to ensure that in the event of operational failures of boundary protection devices
at managed interfaces (e.g., routers, firewalls, guards, and application gateways residing on
protected subnetworks commonly referred to as demilitarized zones), information systems do
not enter into unsecure states where intended security properties no longer hold. Failures of
boundary protection devices cannot lead to, or cause information external to the devices to
enter the devices, nor can failures permit unauthorized information releases. Related controls:
CP-2, SC-24.

Supplemental Guidance:

(19) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | BLOCKS COMMUNICATION FROM NON-ORGANIZATIONALLY CONFIGURED HOSTS
The information system blocks both inbound and outbound communications traffic between
[Assignment: organization-defined communication clients] that are independently configured by
end users and external service providers.

Communication clients independently configured by end users and
external service providers include, for example, instant messaging clients. Traffic blocking
does not apply to communication clients that are configured by organizations to perform
authorized functions.

Supplemental Guidance:

(20) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DYNAMIC ISOLATION / SEGREGATION
The information system provides the capability to dynamically isolate/segregate [Assignment:
organization-defined information system components] from other components of the system.

The capability to dynamically isolate or segregate certain internal
components of organizational information systems is useful when it is necessary to partition
or separate certain components of dubious origin from those components possessing greater
trustworthiness. Component isolation reduces the attack surface of organizational information
systems. Isolation of selected information system components is also a means of limiting the
damage from successful cyber attacks when those attacks occur.
Supplemental Guidance:

(21) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ISOLATION OF INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS
The organization employs boundary protection mechanisms to separate [Assignment:
organization-defined information system components] supporting [Assignment: organizationdefined missions and/or business functions].

Organizations can isolate information system components performing
different missions and/or business functions. Such isolation limits unauthorized information
flows among system components and also provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of
protection for selected components. Separating system components with boundary protection
mechanisms provides the capability for increased protection of individual components and to
more effectively control information flows between those components. This type of enhanced
protection limits the potential harm from cyber attacks and errors. The degree of separation
provided varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen. Boundary protection mechanisms
include, for example, routers, gateways, and firewalls separating system components into
physically separate networks or subnetworks, cross-domain devices separating subnetworks,
virtualization techniques, and encrypting information flows among system components using
distinct encryption keys. Related controls: CA-9, SC-3.
Supplemental Guidance:

(22) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | SEPARATE SUBNETS FOR CONNECTING TO DIFFERENT SECURITY DOMAINS
The information system implements separate network addresses (i.e., different subnets) to connect
to systems in different security domains.
Supplemental Guidance: Decomposition of information systems into subnets helps to provide
the appropriate level of protection for network connections to different security domains
containing information with different security categories or classification levels.
(23) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DISABLE SENDER FEEDBACK ON PROTOCOL VALIDATION FAILURE
The information system disables feedback to senders on protocol format validation failure.

Disabling feedback to senders when there is a failure in protocol
validation format prevents adversaries from obtaining information which would otherwise be
unavailable.

TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY

The information system protects the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of
transmitted information.

Control:

This control applies to both internal and external networks and all types of
information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile
devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines). Communication
paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of
interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and/or integrity of organizational
information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., by employing physical distribution
systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing encryption techniques). Organizations relying on
commercial providers offering transmission services as commodity services rather than as fully
dedicated services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to individual customer needs),
may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed
security controls for transmission confidentiality/integrity. In such situations, organizations
determine what types of confidentiality/integrity services are available in standard, commercial
telecommunication service packages. If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary
security controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles,
organizations implement appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accept the
additional risk. Related controls: AC-17, PE-4.
Supplemental Guidance:

Control Enhancements:

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to [Selection (one or more):
prevent unauthorized disclosure of information; detect changes to information] during
transmission unless otherwise protected by [Assignment: organization-defined alternative physical
safeguards].
Supplemental Guidance: Encrypting information for transmission protects information from
unauthorized disclosure and modification. Cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect
information integrity include, for example, cryptographic hash functions which have common
application in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes. Alternative
physical security safeguards include, for example, protected distribution systems. Related

TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | PRE / POST TRANSMISSION HANDLING

The information system maintains the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of
information during preparation for transmission and during reception.

Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or
modified during preparation for transmission or during reception including, for example,
during aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during packing/unpacking. These
unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the
information. Related control: AU-10.

TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION FOR MESSAGE EXTERNALS

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect message externals
unless otherwise protected by [Assignment: organization-defined alternative physical safeguards].

This control enhancement addresses protection against unauthorized
disclosure of information. Message externals include, for example, message headers/routing
information. This control enhancement prevents the exploitation of message externals and
applies to both internal and external networks or links that may be visible to individuals who
are not authorized users. Header/routing information is sometimes transmitted unencrypted
because the information is not properly identified by organizations as having significant value

TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | CONCEAL / RANDOMIZE COMMUNICATIONS

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to conceal or randomize
communication patterns unless otherwise protected by [Assignment: organization-defined
alternative physical safeguards].

This control enhancement addresses protection against unauthorized
disclosure of information. Communication patterns include, for example, frequency, periods,
amount, and predictability. Changes to communications patterns can reveal information
having intelligence value especially when combined with other available information related
to missions/business functions supported by organizational information systems. This control
enhancement prevents the derivation of intelligence based on communications patterns and
applies to both internal and external networks or links that may be visible to individuals who
are not authorized users. Encrypting the links and transmitting in continuous, fixed/random
patterns prevents the derivation of intelligence from the system communications patterns.
Alternative physical safeguards include, for example, protected distribution systems. Related
controls: SC-12, SC-13.

Control:

Trusted paths are mechanisms by which users (through input devices) can
communicate directly with security functions of information systems with the requisite assurance
to support information security policies. The mechanisms can be activated only by users or the
security functions of organizational information systems. User responses via trusted paths are
protected from modifications by or disclosure to untrusted applications. Organizations employ
trusted paths for high-assurance connections between security functions of information systems
and users (e.g., during system logons). Enforcement of trusted communications paths is typically
provided via an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept. Related controls: AC16, AC-25.

Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions
including, for example, the protection of classified and Controlled Unclassified Information, the
provision of digital signatures, and the enforcement of information separation when authorized
individuals have the necessary clearances for such information but lack the necessary formal

Information systems that provide name and address resolution services
include, for example, domain name system (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of failure
and to enhance redundancy, organizations employ at least two authoritative domain name system
servers, one configured as the primary server and the other configured as the secondary server.
Additionally, organizations typically deploy the servers in two geographically separated network
subnetworks (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). For role separation, DNS servers with
internal roles only process name and address resolution requests from within organizations (i.e.,
from internal clients). DNS servers with external roles only process name and address resolution
information requests from clients external to organizations (i.e., on external networks including
the Internet). Organizations specify clients that can access authoritative DNS servers in particular
roles (e.g., by address ranges, explicit lists). Related controls: SC-2, SC-20, SC-21, SC-24.

System-related information requiring protection includes, for example, configurations or rule sets
for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator
content. Organizations may employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity
protections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity
protection can be achieved, for example, by implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM)
technologies. Organizations may also employ other security controls including, for example,
secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate protection of information at rest
cannot otherwise be achieved and/or continuous monitoring to identify malicious code at rest.

Selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect
the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is
commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. This control
enhancement applies to significant concentrations of digital media in organizational areas
designated for media storage and also to limited quantities of media generally associated with
information system components in operational environments (e.g., portable storage devices,
mobile devices). Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage
devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or

The organization removes from online storage and stores off-line in a secure location [Assignment:
organization-defined information].

Removing organizational information from online information system
storage to off-line storage eliminates the possibility of individuals gaining unauthorized
access to the information through a network. Therefore, organizations may choose to move
information to off-line storage in lieu of protecting such information in online storage.

HETEROGENEITY
Control: The organization employs a diverse set of information technologies for [Assignment:

system.
Supplemental Guidance: Increasing the diversity of information technologies within organizational
information systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations of specific technologies and also
defends against common mode failures, including those failures induced by supply chain attacks.
Diversity in information technologies also reduces the likelihood that the means adversaries use to
compromise one information system component will be equally effective against other system
components, thus further increasing the adversary work factor to successfully complete planned
cyber attacks. An increase in diversity may add complexity and management overhead which
could ultimately lead to mistakes and unauthorized configurations. Related controls: SA-12, SA14, SC-27.

HETEROGENEITY | VIRTUALIZATION TECHNIQUES

The organization employs virtualization techniques to support the deployment of a diversity of
operating systems and applications that are changed [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency].

While frequent changes to operating systems and applications pose
configuration management challenges, the changes can result in an increased work factor for
adversaries in order to carry out successful cyber attacks. Changing virtual operating systems
or applications, as opposed to changing actual operating systems/applications, provide virtual
changes that impede attacker success while reducing configuration management efforts. In
addition, virtualization techniques can assist organizations in isolating untrustworthy software
and/or software of dubious provenance into confined execution environments.

CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION

The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined concealment and
misdirection techniques] for [Assignment: organization-defined information systems] at
[Assignment: organization-defined time periods] to confuse and mislead adversaries.
Control:

Concealment and misdirection techniques can significantly reduce the
targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available attack surface) to
initiate and complete cyber attacks. For example, virtualization techniques provide organizations
with the ability to disguise information systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful
attacks without the cost of having multiple platforms. Increased use of concealment/misdirection
techniques including, for example, randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization, may sufficiently
confuse and mislead adversaries and subsequently increase the risk of discovery and/or exposing
tradecraft. Concealment/misdirection techniques may also provide organizations additional time to
successfully perform core missions and business functions. Because of the time and effort required
to support concealment/misdirection techniques, it is anticipated that such techniques would be
used by organizations on a very limited basis. Related controls: SC-26, SC-29, SI-14.

CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | RANDOMNESS

The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined techniques] to introduce
randomness into organizational operations and assets.

Randomness introduces increased levels of uncertainty for adversaries
regarding the actions organizations take in defending against cyber attacks. Such actions may
impede the ability of adversaries to correctly target information resources of organizations
supporting critical missions/business functions. Uncertainty may also cause adversaries to
hesitate before initiating or continuing attacks. Misdirection techniques involving randomness
include, for example, performing certain routine actions at different times of day, employing
different information technologies (e.g., browsers, search engines), using different suppliers,
and rotating roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel.
Supplemental Guidance:

(3)

CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CHANGE PROCESSING / STORAGE LOCATIONS

The organization changes the location of [Assignment: organization-defined processing and/or
storage] [Selection: [Assignment: organization-defined time frequency]; at random time intervals]].

Adversaries target critical organizational missions/business functions
and the information resources supporting those missions and functions while at the same time,
trying to minimize exposure of their existence and tradecraft. The static, homogeneous, and
deterministic nature of organizational information systems targeted by adversaries, make such
systems more susceptible to cyber attacks with less adversary cost and effort to be successful.
Changing organizational processing and storage locations (sometimes referred to as moving
target defense) addresses the advanced persistent threat (APT) using techniques such as
virtualization, distributed processing, and replication. This enables organizations to relocate
the information resources (i.e., processing and/or storage) supporting critical missions and
business functions. Changing locations of processing activities and/or storage sites introduces
uncertainty into the targeting activities by adversaries. This uncertainty increases the work
factor of adversaries making compromises or breaches to organizational information systems
much more difficult and time-consuming, and increases the chances that adversaries may
inadvertently disclose aspects of tradecraft while attempting to locate critical organizational
resources.

The organization employs realistic, but misleading information in [Assignment: organizationdefined information system components] with regard to its security state or posture.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement misleads potential adversaries regarding the
nature and extent of security safeguards deployed by organizations. As a result, adversaries
may employ incorrect (and as a result ineffective) attack techniques. One way of misleading
adversaries is for organizations to place misleading information regarding the specific security
controls deployed in external information systems that are known to be accessed or targeted
by adversaries. Another technique is the use of deception nets (e.g., honeynets, virtualized
environments) that mimic actual aspects of organizational information systems but use, for
example, out-of-date software configurations.

CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CONCEALMENT OF SYSTEM COMPONENTS
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined techniques] to hide or conceal
[Assignment: organization-defined information system components].

By hiding, disguising, or otherwise concealing critical information

target and successfully compromise those assets. Potential means for organizations to hide
and/or conceal information system components include, for example, configuration of routers
or the use of honeynets or virtualization techniques.

traffic, or nonelectronic paths such as the US Postal Service. This is in contrast with using the
same channels (i.e., in-band channels) that carry routine operational traffic. Out-of-band channels
do not have the same vulnerability/exposure as in-band channels, and hence the confidentiality,
integrity, or availability compromises of in-band channels will not compromise the out-of-band
channels. Organizations may employ out-of-band channels in the delivery or transmission of many
organizational items including, for example, identifiers/authenticators, configuration management
changes for hardware, firmware, or software, cryptographic key management information, security
updates, system/data backups, maintenance information, and malicious code protection updates.

OPERATIONS SECURITY

The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined operations security
safeguards] to protect key organizational information throughout the system development life
cycle.

Control:

Operations security (OPSEC) is a systematic process by which potential
adversaries can be denied information about the capabilities and intentions of organizations by
identifying, controlling, and protecting generally unclassified information that specifically relates
to the planning and execution of sensitive organizational activities. The OPSEC process involves
five steps: (i) identification of critical information (e.g., the security categorization process); (ii)
analysis of threats; (iii) analysis of vulnerabilities; (iv) assessment of risks; and (v) the application
of appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC safeguards are applied to both organizational information
systems and the environments in which those systems operate. OPSEC safeguards help to protect
the confidentiality of key information including, for example, limiting the sharing of information
with suppliers and potential suppliers of information system components, information technology
products and services, and with other non-organizational elements and individuals. Information
critical to mission/business success includes, for example, user identities, element uses, suppliers,
supply chain processes, functional and security requirements, system design specifications, testing
protocols, and security control implementation details. Related controls: RA-2, RA-5, SA-12.

PROCESS ISOLATION
Control:

The information system maintains a separate execution domain for each executing

process.
Information systems can maintain separate execution domains for each
executing process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each information system
process has a distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in a
manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing
code of another process. Maintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be
achieved, for example, by implementing separate address spaces. This capability is available in
most commercial operating systems that employ multi-state processor technologies. Related

WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION
Control: The information system protects external and internal [Assignment: organization-defined
wireless links] from [Assignment: organization-defined types of signal parameter attacks or
references to sources for such attacks].

This control applies to internal and external wireless communication links
that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized information system users. Adversaries
can exploit the signal parameters of wireless links if such links are not adequately protected. There
are many ways to exploit the signal parameters of wireless links to gain intelligence, deny service,
or to spoof users of organizational information systems. This control reduces the impact of attacks
that are unique to wireless systems. If organizations rely on commercial service providers for
transmission services as commodity items rather than as fully dedicated services, it may not be
possible to implement this control. Related controls: AC-18, SC-5.

Supplemental Guidance:

WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION | ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms that achieve [Assignment:
organization-defined level of protection] against the effects of intentional electromagnetic
interference.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement protects against intentional jamming that
might deny or impair communications by ensuring that wireless spread spectrum waveforms
used to provide anti-jam protection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. The
control enhancement may also coincidentally help to mitigate the effects of unintentional
jamming due to interference from legitimate transmitters sharing the same spectrum. Mission
requirements, projected threats, concept of operations, and applicable legislation, directives,
regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines determine levels of wireless link availability
and performance/cryptography needed. Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.

WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION | REDUCE DETECTION POTENTIAL

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to reduce the detection potential
of wireless links to [Assignment: organization-defined level of reduction].

This control enhancement is needed for covert communications and
protecting wireless transmitters from being geo-located by their transmissions. The control
enhancement ensures that spread spectrum waveforms used to achieve low probability of
detection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. Mission requirements, projected
threats, concept of operations, and applicable legislation, directives, regulations, policies,
standards, and guidelines determine the levels to which wireless links should be undetectable.

cameras, microphones, Global Positioning System (GPS) mechanisms, and accelerometers. While
the sensors on mobiles devices provide an important function, if activated covertly, such devices
can potentially provide a means for adversaries to learn valuable information about individuals

SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA | AUTHORIZED USE

The organization employs the following measures: [Assignment: organization-defined measures],
so that data or information collected by [Assignment: organization-defined sensors] is only used
for authorized purposes.
Supplemental Guidance: Information collected by sensors for a specific authorized purpose
potentially could be misused for some unauthorized purpose. For example, GPS sensors that
are used to support traffic navigation could be misused to track movements of individuals.

execute Universal Resource Locator (URL) requests in the safety of an isolated environment or
virtualized sandbox. These protected and isolated execution environments provide a means of
determining whether the associated attachments/applications contain malicious code. While
related to the concept of deception nets, the control is not intended to maintain a long-term
environment in which adversaries can operate and their actions can be observed. Rather, it is
intended to quickly identify malicious code and reduce the likelihood that the code is propagated

continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. Organizations take
advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws discovered in organizational
information systems. By incorporating flaw remediation into ongoing configuration management
processes, required/anticipated remediation actions can be tracked and verified. Flaw remediation
actions that can be tracked and verified include, for example, determining whether organizations
follow US-CERT guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts. Organization-defined
time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of
factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of
the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw
remediation may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the degree and
type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and
also the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations
may determine that the testing of software and/or firmware updates is not necessary or practical,
for example, when implementing simple anti-virus signature updates. Organizations may also
consider in testing decisions, whether security-relevant software or firmware updates are obtained
from authorized sources with appropriate digital signatures. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-3,

detect and eradicate malicious code;

b.

Updates malicious code protection mechanisms whenever new releases are available in
accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures;

c.

Configures malicious code protection mechanisms to:

d.

1.

Perform periodic scans of the information system [Assignment: organization-defined

Addresses the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and
the resulting potential impact on the availability of the information system.

Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls,
electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers, workstations, notebook
computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan
horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE,
Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography.
Malicious code can be transported by different means including, for example, web accesses,
electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code
insertions occur through the exploitation of information system vulnerabilities. Malicious code
protection mechanisms include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based
technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of
malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity
controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial
off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could
include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that could affect
organizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms
cannot always detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards
including, for example, secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted
procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform
functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that in response to the
detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, organizations can
define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, actions in response to
detection of malicious downloads, and/or actions in response to detection of maliciousness when
attempting to open or execute files. Related controls: CM-3, MP-2, SA-4, SA-8, SA-12, SA-13,

g.

Provides [Assignment: organization-defined information system monitoring information] to

[Assignment: organization-defined frequency]].

Information system monitoring includes external and internal monitoring.
External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the information system
boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes
the observation of events occurring within the information system. Organizations can monitor
information systems, for example, by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other
system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring
objectives may guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability is
achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion
prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring
software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for
example, selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with
such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7
and AC-17. Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland Security can
also be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information collected is
based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of information systems to
support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, Hyper Text
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is
an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output
from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs.
A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g.,

INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | PROTECTION OF MONITORING INFORMATION

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-4].
(9)

INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | TESTING OF MONITORING TOOLS

The organization tests intrusion-monitoring tools [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
Supplemental Guidance: Testing intrusion-monitoring tools is necessary to ensure that the tools
are operating correctly and continue to meet the monitoring objectives of organizations. The
frequency of testing depends on the types of tools used by organizations and methods of
deployment. Related control: CP-9.
(10) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | VISIBILITY OF ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATIONS
The organization makes provisions so that [Assignment: organization-defined encrypted
communications traffic] is visible to [Assignment: organization-defined information system
monitoring tools].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations balance the potentially conflicting needs for encrypting
communications traffic and for having insight into such traffic from a monitoring perspective.
For some organizations, the need to ensure the confidentiality of communications traffic is
paramount; for others, mission-assurance is of greater concern. Organizations determine
whether the visibility requirement applies to internal encrypted traffic, encrypted traffic
intended for external destinations, or a subset of the traffic types.
(11) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | ANALYZE COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC ANOMALIES
The organization analyzes outbound communications traffic at the external boundary of the
information system and selected [Assignment: organization-defined interior points within the
system (e.g., subnetworks, subsystems)] to discover anomalies.

Anomalies within organizational information systems include, for
example, large file transfers, long-time persistent connections, unusual protocols and ports in

(c)

Uses the traffic/event profiles in tuning system-monitoring devices to reduce the number of
false positives and the number of false negatives.

(14) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | WIRELESS INTRUSION DETECTION
The organization employs a wireless intrusion detection system to identify rogue wireless devices
and to detect attack attempts and potential compromises/breaches to the information system.

Wireless signals may radiate beyond the confines of organizationcontrolled facilities. Organizations proactively search for unauthorized wireless connections
including the conduct of thorough scans for unauthorized wireless access points. Scans are not
limited to those areas within facilities containing information systems, but also include areas
outside of facilities as needed, to verify that unauthorized wireless access points are not
connected to the systems. Related controls: AC-18, IA-3.

Supplemental Guidance:

(15) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | WIRELESS TO WIRELINE COMMUNICATIONS
The organization employs an intrusion detection system to monitor wireless communications
traffic as the traffic passes from wireless to wireline networks.
Supplemental Guidance:

Related control: AC-18.

(16) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | CORRELATE MONITORING INFORMATION
The organization correlates information from monitoring tools employed throughout the
information system.

Correlating information from different monitoring tools can provide a
more comprehensive view of information system activity. The correlation of monitoring tools
that usually work in isolation (e.g., host monitoring, network monitoring, anti-virus software)
can provide an organization-wide view and in so doing, may reveal otherwise unseen attack
patterns. Understanding the capabilities/limitations of diverse monitoring tools and how to
maximize the utility of information generated by those tools can help organizations to build,
operate, and maintain effective monitoring programs. Related control: AU-6.

Supplemental Guidance:

(17) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | INTEGRATED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS
The organization correlates information from monitoring physical, cyber, and supply chain
activities to achieve integrated, organization-wide situational awareness.

This control enhancement correlates monitoring information from a
more diverse set of information sources to achieve integrated situational awareness. Integrated
situational awareness from a combination of physical, cyber, and supply chain monitoring
activities enhances the capability of organizations to more quickly detect sophisticated cyber
attacks and investigate the methods and techniques employed to carry out such attacks. In
contrast to SI-4 (16) which correlates the various cyber monitoring information, this control
enhancement correlates monitoring beyond just the cyber domain. Such monitoring may help
reveal attacks on organizations that are operating across multiple attack vectors. Related
control: SA-12.

Supplemental Guidance:

(18) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | ANALYZE TRAFFIC / COVERT EXFILTRATION
The organization analyzes outbound communications traffic at the external boundary of the
information system (i.e., system perimeter) and at [Assignment: organization-defined interior
points within the system (e.g., subsystems, subnetworks)] to detect covert exfiltration of
information.

Supplemental Guidance:

(23) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | HOST-BASED DEVICES
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined host-based monitoring
mechanisms] at [Assignment: organization-defined information system components].
Supplemental Guidance: Information system components where host-based monitoring can be
implemented include, for example, servers, workstations, and mobile devices. Organizations
consider employing host-based monitoring mechanisms from multiple information technology
product developers.
(24) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE
The information system discovers, collects, distributes, and uses indicators of compromise.

Indicators of compromise (IOC) are forensic artifacts from intrusions
that are identified on organizational information systems (at the host or network level). IOCs
provide organizations with valuable information on objects or information systems that have
been compromised. IOCs for the discovery of compromised hosts can include for example,
the creation of registry key values. IOCs for network traffic include, for example, Universal
Resource Locator (URL) or protocol elements that indicate malware command and control
servers. The rapid distribution and adoption of IOCs can improve information security by
reducing the time that information systems and organizations are vulnerable to the same
exploit or attack.

Unauthorized modifications to boot firmware may be indicative of a
sophisticated, targeted cyber attack. These types of cyber attacks can result in a permanent
denial of service (e.g., if the firmware is corrupted) or a persistent malicious code presence
(e.g., if code is embedded within the firmware). Devices can protect the integrity of the boot
firmware in organizational information systems by: (i) verifying the integrity and authenticity
of all updates to the boot firmware prior to applying changes to the boot devices; and (ii)
preventing unauthorized processes from modifying the boot firmware.

Supplemental Guidance:

(11) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CONFINED ENVIRONMENTS WITH LIMITED PRIVILEGES
The organization requires that [Assignment: organization-defined user-installed software] execute
in a confined physical or virtual machine environment with limited privileges.

Organizations identify software that may be of greater concern with
regard to origin or potential for containing malicious code. For this type of software, user
installations occur in confined environments of operation to limit or contain damage from
malicious code that may be executed.

Supplemental Guidance:

(12) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | INTEGRITY VERIFICATION
The organization requires that the integrity of [Assignment: organization-defined user-installed
software] be verified prior to execution.

Organizations verify the integrity of user-installed software prior to
execution to reduce the likelihood of executing malicious code or code that contains errors
from unauthorized modifications. Organizations consider the practicality of approaches to
verifying software integrity including, for example, availability of checksums of adequate
trustworthiness from software developers or vendors.

INFORMATION INPUT RESTRICTIONS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, AC-6].

SI-10

INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION
Control: The information system checks the validity of [Assignment: organization-defined
information inputs].

Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs
(e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match
specified definitions for format and content. Software applications typically follow well-defined
protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between
software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured
data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attackersupplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then
the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be
interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that
receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data
incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being
unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct
inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.

INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | REVIEW / RESOLUTION OF ERRORS

The organization ensures that input validation errors are reviewed and resolved within
[Assignment: organization-defined time period].

Resolution of input validation errors includes, for example, correcting
systemic causes of errors and resubmitting transactions with corrected input.

Supplemental Guidance:
(3)

INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | PREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR

The information system behaves in a predictable and documented manner that reflects
organizational and system objectives when invalid inputs are received.

A common vulnerability in organizational information systems is
unpredictable behavior when invalid inputs are received. This control enhancement ensures
that there is predictable behavior in the face of invalid inputs by specifying information
system responses that facilitate transitioning the system to known states without adverse,
unintended side effects.

Supplemental Guidance:

(4)

INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | REVIEW / TIMING INTERACTIONS

The organization accounts for timing interactions among information system components in
determining appropriate responses for invalid inputs.

In addressing invalid information system inputs received across
protocol interfaces, timing interfaces become relevant, where one protocol needs to consider
the impact of the error response on other protocols within the protocol stack. For example,
802.11 standard wireless network protocols do not interact well with Transmission Control
Protocols (TCP) when packets are dropped (which could be due to invalid packet input). TCP
assumes packet losses are due to congestion, while packets lost over 802.11 links are typically
dropped due to collisions or noise on the link. If TCP makes a congestion response, it takes

precisely the wrong action in response to a collision event. Adversaries may be able to use
apparently acceptable individual behaviors of the protocols in concert to achieve adverse
effects through suitable construction of invalid input.

INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | RESTRICT INPUTS TO TRUSTED SOURCES AND APPROVED FORMATS

The organization restricts the use of information inputs to [Assignment: organization-defined
trusted sources] and/or [Assignment: organization-defined formats].

This control enhancement applies the concept of whitelisting to

The extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error conditions is guided
by organizational policy and operational requirements. Information that could be exploited by
adversaries includes, for example, erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as
the username, mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly by)
information recorded, and personal information such as account numbers, social security numbers,
and credit card numbers. In addition, error messages may provide a covert channel for transmitting
information. Related controls: AU-2, AU-3, SC-31.

PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION
Control:

The organization:

a.

Determines mean time to failure (MTTF) for [Assignment: organization-defined information
system components] in specific environments of operation; and

b.

Provides substitute information system components and a means to exchange active and
standby components at [Assignment: organization-defined MTTF substitution criteria].

While MTTF is primarily a reliability issue, this control addresses potential
failures of specific information system components that provide security capability. Failure rates
reflect installation-specific consideration, not industry-average. Organizations define criteria for
substitution of information system components based on MTTF value with consideration for
resulting potential harm from component failures. Transfer of responsibilities between active and
standby components does not compromise safety, operational readiness, or security capability
(e.g., preservation of state variables). Standby components remain available at all times except for
maintenance issues or recovery failures in progress. Related controls: CP-2, CP-10, MA-6.
Supplemental Guidance:

Control Enhancements:

components [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] if the mean time to failure exceeds
[Assignment: organization-defined time period].
(4)

PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION | STANDBY COMPONENT INSTALLATION / NOTIFICATION

The organization, if information system component failures are detected:
(a)

Ensures that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within
[Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and

(b) [Selection (one or more): activates [Assignment: organization-defined alarm]; automatically
shuts down the information system].

Automatic or manual transfer of components from standby to active

PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION | FAILOVER CAPABILITY

The organization provides [Selection: real-time; near real-time] [Assignment: organization-defined
failover capability] for the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Failover refers to the automatic switchover to an alternate information
system upon the failure of the primary information system. Failover capability includes, for
example, incorporating mirrored information system operations at alternate processing sites or
periodic data mirroring at regular intervals defined by recovery time periods of organizations.

NON-PERSISTENCE
Control: The organization implements non-persistent [Assignment: organization-defined
information system components and services] that are initiated in a known state and terminated
[Selection (one or more): upon end of session of use; periodically at [Assignment: organizationdefined frequency]].

This control mitigates risk from advanced persistent threats (APTs) by
significantly reducing the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and
available attack surface) to initiate and complete cyber attacks. By implementing the concept of
non-persistence for selected information system components, organizations can provide a known
state computing resource for a specific period of time that does not give adversaries sufficient time
on target to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational information systems and the environments in
which those systems operate. Since the advanced persistent threat is a high-end threat with regard
to capability, intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period of time, a
percentage of cyber attacks will be successful. Non-persistent information system components and
services are activated as required using protected information and terminated periodically or upon
the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the work factor of adversaries in attempting to
compromise or breach organizational information systems.
Supplemental Guidance:

Non-persistent system components can be implemented, for example, by periodically re-imaging
components or by using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services
can be implemented using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new instances
of processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent).The benefit of periodic
refreshes of information system components/services is that it does not require organizations to
first determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that
may often be difficult for organizations to determine). The refresh of selected information system
components and services occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact
of attacks, but not with such frequency that it makes the information system unstable. In some
instances, refreshes of critical components and services may be done periodically in order to
hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows of vulnerabilities. Related controls:
SC-30, SC-34.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

NON-PERSISTENCE | REFRESH FROM TRUSTED SOURCES

The organization ensures that software and data employed during information system component
and service refreshes are obtained from [Assignment: organization-defined trusted sources].

Trusted sources include, for example, software/data from write-once,
read-only media or from selected off-line secure storage facilities.

Control:

Certain types of cyber attacks (e.g., SQL injections) produce output results
that are unexpected or inconsistent with the output results that would normally be expected from
software programs or applications. This control enhancement focuses on detecting extraneous
content, preventing such extraneous content from being displayed, and alerting monitoring tools

INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAMS
ORGANIZATION-WIDE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONTROLS

T

he Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requires organizations to
develop and implement an organization-wide information security program to address
information security for the information and information systems that support the
operations and assets of the organization, including those provided or managed by another
organization, contractor, or other source. The information security program management (PM)
controls described in this appendix are typically implemented at the organization level and not
directed at individual organizational information systems. The program management controls
have been designed to facilitate compliance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
directives, policies, regulations, and standards. The controls are independent of any FIPS
Publication 200 impact levels and therefore, are not directly associated with any of the security
control baselines described in Appendix D. The program management controls do, however,
complement the security controls in Appendix F and focus on the programmatic, organizationwide information security requirements that are independent of any particular information system
and are essential for managing information security programs. Tailoring guidance can be applied
to the program management controls in a manner similar to how the guidance is applied to
security controls in Appendix F. Organizations specify the individual or individuals responsible
and accountable for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring
of the program management controls. Organizations document program management controls in
the information security program plan. The organization-wide information security program plan
supplements the individual security plans developed for each organizational information system.
Together, the security plans for the individual information systems and the information security
program cover the totality of security controls employed by the organization.
In addition to documenting the information security program management controls, the security
program plan provides a vehicle for the organization, in a central repository, to document all
security controls from Appendix F that have been designated as common controls (i.e., security
controls inheritable by organizational information systems). 111 The information security program
management controls and common controls contained in the information security program plan
are implemented, assessed for effectiveness, 112 and authorized by a senior organizational official,
with the same or similar authority and responsibility for managing risk as the authorization
officials for information systems. Plans of action and milestones are developed and maintained
for the program management and common controls that are deemed through assessment to be less
than effective. Information security program management and common controls are also subject
to the same continuous monitoring requirements as security controls employed in individual
organizational information systems.

111

Common controls are those security controls that are inheritable by one or more organizational information systems,
and thus are separate and distinct from information security program management controls.
112

Assessment procedures for program management controls and common controls can be found in NIST Special
Publication 800-53A.

Cautionary Note
Organizations are required to implement security program management controls to provide a foundation
for the organizational information security program. The successful implementation of security controls
for organizational information systems depends on the successful implementation of organization-wide
program management controls. However, the manner in which organizations implement the program
management controls depends on specific organizational characteristics including, for example, the size,
complexity, and mission/business requirements of the respective organizations.

PM-1

INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM PLAN
Control:

a.

The organization:

Develops and disseminates an organization-wide information security program plan that:
1.

Provides an overview of the requirements for the security program and a description of
the security program management controls and common controls in place or planned for
meeting those requirements;

2.

Includes the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities, management
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance;

3.

Reflects coordination among organizational entities responsible for the different aspects
of information security (i.e., technical, physical, personnel, cyber-physical); and

4.

Is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for the risk being
incurred to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;

b.

Reviews the organization-wide information security program plan [Assignment: organizationdefined frequency];

c.

Updates the plan to address organizational changes and problems identified during plan
implementation or security control assessments; and

d.

Protects the information security program plan from unauthorized disclosure and
modification.

Information security program plans can be represented in single documents
or compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans document the program
management controls and organization-defined common controls. Information security program
plans provide sufficient information about the program management controls/common controls
(including specification of parameters for any assignment and selection statements either explicitly
or by reference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of
the plans and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the plans are implemented as intended.

Supplemental Guidance:

The security plans for individual information systems and the organization-wide information
security program plan together, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed
within the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s
information security program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for
an information system (e.g., security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system
providing organization-wide boundary protection inherited by one or more organizational
information systems). The organization-wide information security program plan will indicate
which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls.
Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple
documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are
included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the information security
program plan contains multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document the
organizational official or officials responsible for the development, implementation, assessment,
authorization, and monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization
may require that the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and
continuously monitor common physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family
when such controls are not associated with a particular information system but instead, support
multiple information systems. Related control: PM-8.

security program and is subject to federal reporting requirements established by OMB. With the
increasing emphasis on organization-wide risk management across all three tiers in the risk
management hierarchy (i.e., organization, mission/business process, and information system),
organizations view plans of action and milestones from an organizational perspective, prioritizing
risk response actions and ensuring consistency with the goals and objectives of the organization.

ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE

The organization develops an enterprise architecture with consideration for information
security and the resulting risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation.

Control:

The enterprise architecture developed by the organization is aligned with
the Federal Enterprise Architecture. The integration of information security requirements and
associated security controls into the organization’s enterprise architecture helps to ensure that
security considerations are addressed by organizations early in the system development life cycle
and are directly and explicitly related to the organization’s mission/business processes. This
process of security requirements integration also embeds into the enterprise architecture, an
integral information security architecture consistent with organizational risk management and
information security strategies. For PM-7, the information security architecture is developed at a
system-of-systems level (organization-wide), representing all of the organizational information
systems. For PL-8, the information security architecture is developed at a level representing an
individual information system but at the same time, is consistent with the information security
architecture defined for the organization. Security requirements and security control integration
are most effectively accomplished through the application of the Risk Management Framework
and supporting security standards and guidelines. The Federal Segment Architecture Methodology
provides guidance on integrating information security requirements and security controls into
enterprise architectures. Related controls: PL-2, PL-8, PM-11, RA-2, SA-3.

information systems;

b.

Implements the risk management strategy consistently across the organization; and

c.

Reviews and updates the risk management strategy [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency] or as required, to address organizational changes.

An organization-wide risk management strategy includes, for example, an
unambiguous expression of the risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable risk assessment
methodologies, risk mitigation strategies, a process for consistently evaluating risk across the
organization with respect to the organization’s risk tolerance, and approaches for monitoring risk
over time. The use of a risk executive function can facilitate consistent, organization-wide
application of the risk management strategy. The organization-wide risk management strategy can
be informed by risk-related inputs from other sources both internal and external to the organization
to ensure the strategy is both broad-based and comprehensive. Related control: RA-3.

a.

Manages (i.e., documents, tracks, and reports) the security state of organizational information
systems and the environments in which those systems operate through security authorization
processes;

b.

Designates individuals to fulfill specific roles and responsibilities within the organizational
risk management process; and

c.

Fully integrates the security authorization processes into an organization-wide risk
management program.

Supplemental Guidance: Security authorization processes for information systems and environments
of operation require the implementation of an organization-wide risk management process, a Risk
Management Framework, and associated security standards and guidelines. Specific roles within
the risk management process include an organizational risk executive (function) and designated
authorizing officials for each organizational information system and common control provider.
Security authorization processes are integrated with organizational continuous monitoring

MISSION/BUSINESS PROCESS DEFINITION
Control:

The organization:

a.

Defines mission/business processes with consideration for information security and the
resulting risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation; and

b.

Determines information protection needs arising from the defined mission/business processes
and revises the processes as necessary, until achievable protection needs are obtained.

Supplemental Guidance: Information protection needs are technology-independent, required
capabilities to counter threats to organizations, individuals, or the Nation through the compromise
of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). Information protection needs
are derived from the mission/business needs defined by the organization, the mission/business
processes selected to meet the stated needs, and the organizational risk management strategy.
Information protection needs determine the required security controls for the organization and the
associated information systems supporting the mission/business processes. Inherent in defining an
organization’s information protection needs is an understanding of the level of adverse impact that
could result if a compromise of information occurs. The security categorization process is used to
make such potential impact determinations. Mission/business process definitions and associated
information protection requirements are documented by the organization in accordance with
organizational policy and procedure. Related controls: PM-7, PM-8, RA-2.

INSIDER THREAT PROGRAM
Control: The organization implements an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline
insider threat incident handling team.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations handling classified information are required, under
Executive Order 13587 and the National Policy on Insider Threat, to establish insider threat
programs. The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified
environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of Controlled Unclassified
Information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include security controls to
detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis of
both technical and non-technical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior
organizational official is designated by the department/agency head as the responsible individual
to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and
analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare department/agency insider
threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of individual
employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat awareness
training to employees, receive access to information from all offices within the department/agency
(e.g., human resources, legal, physical security, personnel security, information technology,
information system security, and law enforcement) for insider threat analysis, and conduct selfassessments of department/agency insider threat posture.

Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams organizations may
already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources

records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some
types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace (e.g.,
ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues).
These precursors can better inform and guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted
monitoring efforts. The participation of a legal team is important to ensure that all monitoring
activities are performed in accordance with appropriate legislation, directives, regulations,

Information security workforce development and improvement programs
include, for example: (i) defining the knowledge and skill levels needed to perform information
security duties and tasks; (ii) developing role-based training programs for individuals assigned
information security roles and responsibilities; and (iii) providing standards for measuring and
building individual qualifications for incumbents and applicants for information security-related
positions. Such workforce programs can also include associated information security career paths
to encourage: (i) information security professionals to advance in the field and fill positions with
greater responsibility; and (ii) organizations to fill information security-related positions with
qualified personnel. Information security workforce development and improvement programs are
complementary to organizational security awareness and training programs. Information security

are coordinated. With the importance of continuous monitoring programs, the implementation of
information security across the three tiers of the risk management hierarchy, and the widespread
use of common controls, organizations coordinate and consolidate the testing and monitoring
activities that are routinely conducted as part of ongoing organizational assessments supporting a
variety of security controls. Security training activities, while typically focused on individual
information systems and specific roles, also necessitate coordination across all organizational
elements. Testing, training, and monitoring plans and activities are informed by current threat and
vulnerability assessments. Related controls: AT-3, CA-7, CP-4, IR-3, SI-4.

a.

To facilitate ongoing security education and training for organizational personnel;

b.

To maintain currency with recommended security practices, techniques, and technologies; and

c.

To share current security-related information including threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents.

Ongoing contact with security groups and associations is of paramount
importance in an environment of rapidly changing technologies and threats. Security groups and
associations include, for example, special interest groups, forums, professional associations, news
groups, and/or peer groups of security professionals in similar organizations. Organizations select

THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM
Control: The organization implements a threat awareness program that includes a crossorganization information-sharing capability.

Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of
adversaries, especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it is becoming more likely that
adversaries may successfully breach or compromise organizational information systems. One of
the best techniques to address this concern is for organizations to share threat information. This
can include, for example, sharing threat events (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) that
organizations have experienced, mitigations that organizations have found are effective against
certain types of threats, threat intelligence (i.e., indications and warnings about threats that are
likely to occur). Threat information sharing may be bilateral (e.g., government-commercial
cooperatives, government-government cooperatives), or multilateral (e.g., organizations taking
part in threat-sharing consortia). Threat information may be highly sensitive requiring special
agreements and protection, or less sensitive and freely shared. Related controls: PM-12, PM-16.

INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS
SECURITY CONTROL MAPPINGS FOR ISO/IEC 27001 AND 15408

T

he mapping tables in this appendix provide organizations with a general indication of
security control coverage with respect to ISO/IEC 27001, Information technology–Security
techniques–Information security management systems–Requirements 113 and ISO/IEC
15408, Information technology -- Security techniques -- Evaluation criteria for IT security. 114
ISO/IEC 27001 applies to all types of organizations and specifies requirements for establishing,
implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and improving a documented
information security management system (ISMS) within the context of business risks. NIST
Special Publication 800-39 includes guidance on managing risk at the organizational level,
mission/business process level, and information system level, is consistent with ISO/IEC 27001,
and provides additional implementation detail for the federal government and its contractors.
ISO/IEC 15408 (also known as the Common Criteria) provides functionality and assurance
requirements for developers of information systems and information system components (i.e.,
information technology products). Since many of the technical security controls defined in
Appendix F are implemented in hardware, software, and firmware components of information
systems, organizations can obtain significant benefit from the acquisition and employment of
information technology products evaluated against the requirements of ISO/IEC 15408. The use
of such products can provide evidence that certain security controls are implemented correctly,
operating as intended, and producing the desired effect in satisfying stated security requirements.

113

ISO/IEC 27001 was published in October 2005 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
114
ISO/IEC 15408 was published in September 2012 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and
the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Table H-1 provides a mapping from the security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 to
the security controls in ISO/IEC 27001. The mappings are created by using the primary security
topic identified in each of the Special Publication 800-53 and searching for a similar security
topic in ISO/IEC 27001. Security controls with similar functional meaning are included in the
mapping table. For example, Special Publication 800-53 contingency planning and ISO/IEC
27001 business continuity were deemed to have similar, but not the same, functionality. In some
cases, similar topics are addressed in the security control sets but provide a different context,
perspective, or scope. For example, Special Publication 800-53 addresses information flow
control broadly in terms of approved authorizations for controlling access between source and
destination objects, whereas ISO/IEC 27001 addresses the information flow more narrowly as it
applies to interconnected network domains. Table H-2 provides a reverse mapping from the
security controls in ISO/IEC 27001 to the security controls in Special Publication 800-53. 115

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Table H-3 provides a generalized mapping from the functional and assurance requirements in
ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria) to the security controls in Special Publication 800-53. The
table represents an informal correspondence between security requirements and security controls
(i.e., the table is not intended to determine whether the ISO/IEC 15408 security requirements are
fully, partially, or not satisfied by the associated security controls). However, the table can serve
as a beneficial starting point for further correspondence analysis. Organizations are cautioned that
satisfying ISO/IEC 15408 security requirements for an particular evaluated and validated
information technology product as represented by the presence of certain security controls from
Appendix F, does not imply that such requirements have been satisfied throughout the entire
information system (which may consist of multiple, integrated individual component products).
Additional information explaining the specific mappings that appear in Table H-3 is available at
the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) website at: http://www.niap-ccevs.org.

APPENDIX I

OVERLAY TEMPLATE
APPLYING TAILORING GUIDANCE FOR SPECIAL CONDITIONS OR COMMUNITY-WIDE USE

116

O

rganizations may use the following template when developing tailored baselines using the
concept of overlays. 117 The template is provided as an example only—organizations may
choose to use other formats or modify the format in this appendix based on organizational
needs and the type of overlay being developed. The level of detail included in the overlay is at the
discretion of the organization initiating the overlay but should be of sufficient breadth and depth
to provide an appropriate rationale and justification for the resulting tailored baseline developed,
including any risk-based decisions made during the overlay development process. Security
control baseline tailoring using the concept of overlays results in security plans that are subject to
approval by authorizing officials. The example template consists of eight sections:
•

Identification;

•

Overlay Characteristics;

•

Applicability;

•

Overlay Summary;

•

Detailed Overlay Control Specifications;

•

Tailoring Considerations;

•

Definitions; and

•

Additional Information or Instructions.

How Overlays Can Be Used
Within the Risk Management Framework (RMF), overlays are implemented as part of the
tailoring process after the completion of an initial security categorization process described in
Section 3.1 and any organization-specific guidance. The security categorization process results in
the determination of an impact level of the information system, and is subsequently used to select
an initial set of security controls from one of the security control baselines in Appendix D.118
After the initial set of security controls is identified, organizations initiate the tailoring process to
modify and align the controls more closely with the specific conditions within the organizations.
Overlays provide tailoring guidance from a community-wide perspective to address specialized
requirements, missions/business functions, technologies, or environments of operation. Overlays
provide uniformity and efficiency of security control selection by presenting tailoring options

116

Tailored baselines produced using the concept of overlays can be published independently in a variety of venues and
publications including, for example, OMB policies, CNSS Instructions, NIST Special Publications, industry standards,
and sector-specific guidance. As part of the overlay initiative, the previous guidance in Appendix I regarding industrial
and process control system security will be transferred to NIST Special Publication 800-82.
117
While organizations are encouraged to use the overlay concept to tailor security control baselines, generating widely
divergent overlays on the same topic may prove to be counterproductive. The overlay concept is most effective when
communities of interest work together to create consensus-based overlays that are not duplicative.
118
CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security categorization guidance and security control baselines for national security
systems.

APPENDIX I

developed by security experts and other subject matter experts to information system owners
responsible for implementing and maintaining such systems.
There is a considerable range of options that can be used to construct overlays, depending on the
specificity desired by the overlay developers. Some overlays may be very specific with respect to
the hardware, firmware, and software that form the key components the information system and
the environment in which the system operates. Other overlays may be more abstract in order to be
applicable to a large class of information systems that may be deployed in different environments.
The example template described below can be used for any level of specificity on this continuum
of potential options for overlays.
Overlays that provide greater specificity are typically developed by organizations with authority
over the information system owners and environments of operation. Organizations decide on the
appropriate tailoring actions for the selected baseline security controls as described in Section 3.2.
Many of the variables and conditions that qualify the overlay for use on a specific information
system are made explicit to ensure consistency when applying the overlay. Overlays that provide
less specificity can also be developed by security and subject matter experts for application to
large classes of information systems or in situations where there is less than full knowledge about
the specific implementation details related to the system. Less specific overlays may require
additional tailoring to customize the set of security controls for the specific information system.
These overlays leave many of the assignment and selection statements in the security controls
(i.e., the variable portion of the controls) to be completed by the organization that owns and
operates the information system. The eight sections comprising the overlay are described below.
Identification
Organizations identify the overlay by providing: (i) a unique name for the overlay; (ii) a version
number and date; (iii) the version of NIST Special Publication 800-53 used to create the overlay;
(iv) other documentation used to create the overlay; (v) author or authoring group and point of
contact; and (vi) type of organizational approval received. Organizations define how long the
overlay is to be in effect and any events that may trigger an update to the overlay other than
changes to NIST Special Publication 800-53 or organization-specific security guidance. If there
are no unique events that can trigger an update for the overlay, this section provides that notation.
Overlay Characteristics
Organizations describe the characteristics that define the intended use of the overlay in order to
help potential users select the most appropriate overlay for their missions/business functions. This
may include, for example, a description of: (i) the environment in which the information system
will be used (e.g., inside a guarded building within the continental United States, in an unmanned
space vehicle, while traveling for business to a foreign country that is known for attempting to
gain access to sensitive or classified information, or in a mobile vehicle that is in close proximity
to hostile entities); (ii) the type of information that will be processed, stored, or transmitted (e.g.,
personal identity and authentication information, financial management information, facilities,
fleet, and equipment management information, defense and national security information, system
development information); (iii) the functionality within the information system or the type of
system (e.g., standalone system, industrial/process control system, or cross-domain system); and
(iv) other characteristics related to the overlay that help protect organizational missions/business
functions, information systems, information, or individuals from a specific set of threats that may
not be addressed by the assumptions described in Chapter Three.

Applicability
Organizations provide criteria to assist potential users of the overlay in determining whether or
not the overlay applies to a particular information system or environment of operation. Typical
formats include, for example, a list of questions or a decision tree based on the description of the
characteristics of the information system (including associated applications) and its environment
of operation at the level of specificity appropriate to the overlay.
Overlay Summary
Organizations provide a brief summary of the salient characteristics of the overlay. This summary
may include, for example: (i) the security controls and control enhancements that are affected by
the overlay; (ii) an indication of which controls/enhancements are selected or not selected based
on the characteristics and assumptions in the overlay, the tailoring guidance provided in Section
3.2, or any organization-specific guidance; (iii) the selected controls/enhancements including an
overview of new supplemental guidance and parameter values; and (iv) references to applicable
laws, Executive Orders, directives, instructions, regulations, policies, or standards.
Detailed Overlay Control Specifications
Organizations provide a comprehensive expression of the security controls/control enhancements
in the overlay as part of the tailoring process. This may include, for example: (i) justification for
selecting or not selecting a specific security control/control enhancement; (ii) modifications to the
supplemental guidance or the addition of new supplemental guidance for the security controls and
control enhancements to address the characteristics of the overlay and the environments in which
the overlay is intended to operate; (iii) unique parameter values for security control selection or
assignment statements; (iv) specific statutory and/or regulatory requirements (above and beyond
FISMA) that are met by a security control or control enhancement; (v) recommendations for
compensating controls, as appropriate; and (vi) guidance that extends the basic capability of the
control/enhancement by specifying additional functionality, altering the strength of mechanism,
or adding or limiting implementation options.
Tailoring Considerations
Organizations provide information to information system owners and authorizing officials to
consider during the tailoring process when determining the set of security controls applicable to
their specific information systems. This is especially important for overlays that are used in an
environment of operation different from the one assumed by the security control baselines (as
defined in Section 3.1). In addition, organizations can provide guidance on the use of multiple
overlays applied to a security control baseline and address any potential conflicts that may arise
between overlay specifications and baseline controls.
Definitions
Organizations provide any terms and associated definitions that are unique and relevant to the
overlay. The terms and definitions are listed in alphabetical order. If there are no unique terms or
definitions for the overlay, this is stated in this section.
Additional Information or Instructions
Organizations provide any additional information or instructions relevant to the overlay not
covered in the previous sections.

he need to protect an individual's privacy is as important today as it was in 1974 when the
Privacy Act first sought to balance the government's need to collect information from an
individual with a citizen's right to be notified as to how that information was being used,
collected, maintained, and disposed of after the requisite period of use. These concerns are also
shared in the private sector, where healthcare, financial, and other services continue to be
delivered via the web with increasingly higher levels of personalization. The proliferation of
social media, Smart Grid, mobile, and cloud computing, as well as the transition from structured
to unstructured data and metadata environments, have added significant complexities and
challenges for federal organizations in safeguarding privacy. These challenges extend well
beyond the traditional information technology security view of protecting privacy which focused
primarily on ensuring confidentiality. Now there are greater implications with respect to
controlling the integrity of an individual's information, and with ensuring that an individual's
information is available on demand. The challenging landscape requires federal organizations to
expand their view of privacy, in order to meet citizen expectations of privacy that go beyond
information security.

Privacy, with respect to personally identifiable information (PII), 119 is a core value that can be
obtained only with appropriate legislation, policies, procedures, and associated controls to ensure
compliance with requirements. Protecting the privacy of individuals and their PII that is collected,
used, maintained, shared, and disposed of by programs and information systems, is a fundamental
responsibility of federal organizations. Privacy also involves each individual’s right to decide
when and whether to share personal information, how much information to share, and the
particular circumstances under which that information can be shared. In today’s digital world,
effective privacy for individuals depends on the safeguards employed within the information
systems that are processing, storing, and transmitting PII and the environments in which those
systems operate. Organizations cannot have effective privacy without a basic foundation of
information security. Privacy is more than security, however, and includes, for example, the
principles of transparency, notice, and choice.
This appendix provides a structured set of controls for protecting privacy and serves as a roadmap
for organizations to use in identifying and implementing privacy controls concerning the entire
life cycle of PII, whether in paper or electronic form. The controls focus on information privacy
as a value distinct from, but highly interrelated with, information security. Privacy controls are
119

OMB Memorandum 07-16 defines PII as information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s
identity such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc., alone, or when combined with other
personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth,
mother’s maiden name, etc. OMB Memorandum 10-22 further states that “the definition of PII is not anchored to any
single category of information or technology. Rather, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an
individual can be identified by examining the context of use and combination of data elements. In performing this
assessment, it is important for agencies to recognize that non-PII can become PII, whenever additional information is
made publicly available, in any medium and from any source that, when combined with other available information,
could be used to identify an individual.” NIST Special Publication 800-122 also includes a definition of PII that differs
from this appendix because it was focused on the security objective of confidentiality and not privacy in the broad
sense. Organizational definitions of PII may vary based on the consideration of additional regulatory requirements. The
privacy controls in this appendix apply regardless of the definition of PII by organizations.

the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards employed within organizations to protect
and ensure the proper handling of PII. 120 Organizations may also engage in activities that do not
involve the collection and use of PII, but may nevertheless raise privacy concerns and associated
risk. The privacy controls are equally applicable to those activities and can be used to analyze the
privacy risk and mitigate such risk when necessary.
The privacy controls in this appendix are based on the Fair Information Practice Principles
(FIPPs) 121 embodied in the Privacy Act of 1974, Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002,
and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies. The FIPPs are designed to build public
trust in the privacy practices of organizations and to help organizations avoid tangible costs and
intangible damages from privacy incidents. There are eight privacy control families, each aligning
with one of the FIPPs. The privacy families can be implemented at the organization, department,
agency, component, office, program, or information system level, under the leadership and
oversight of the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) 122 and
in coordination with the Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Information Officer, program
officials, legal counsel, and others as appropriate. Table J-1 provides a summary of the privacy
controls by family in the privacy control catalog.

In 2010, the Federal CIO Council Privacy Committee issued a framework for designing and implementing a privacy
program entitled Best Practices: Elements of a Federal Privacy Program (Elements White Paper). The privacy controls
in this appendix mirror a number of the elements included in the paper. Organizations can use the privacy controls and
the guidance in the paper to develop an organization-wide privacy program or enhance an already existing program.
121

The FIPPs are widely accepted in the United States and internationally as a general framework for privacy and are
reflected in other federal and international laws and policies. In a number of organizations, FIPPs serve as the basis for
analyzing privacy risks and determining appropriate mitigation strategies. The Federal Enterprise Architecture Security
and Privacy Profile (FEA-SPP) also provided information and materials in development of the privacy controls.
122

All federal agencies and departments designate an SAOP/CPO as the senior organizational official with the overall
organization-wide responsibility for information privacy issues. OMB Memorandum 05-08 provides guidance for the
designation of SAOPs/CPOs. The term SAOP/CPO as used in this appendix means an organization’s senior privacy
leader, whose job title may vary from organization to organization.

There is a strong similarity between the structure of the privacy controls in this appendix and the
structure of the security controls in Appendices F and G. For example, the control AR-1
(Governance and Privacy Program) requires organizations to develop privacy plans that can be
implemented at the organizational or program level. These plans can also be used in conjunction
with security plans to provide an opportunity for organizations to select the appropriate set of
security and privacy controls in accordance with organizational mission/business requirements
and the environments in which the organizations operate. Incorporating the fundamental concepts
associated with managing information security risk helps to ensure that the employment of
privacy controls is carried out in a cost-effective and risk-based manner while simultaneously
meeting compliance requirements. Standardized privacy controls and assessment procedures
(developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the controls) will provide a more disciplined and
structured approach for satisfying federal privacy requirements and demonstrating compliance
with those requirements.
In summary, the Privacy Appendix achieves several important objectives. The appendix:
•

Provides a structured set of privacy controls, based on best practices, that helps organizations
comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, instructions, regulations,
policies, standards, guidance, and organization-specific issuances;

•

Establishes a linkage and relationship between privacy and security controls for purposes of
enforcing respective privacy and security requirements that may overlap in concept and in
implementation within federal information systems, programs, and organizations;

•

Demonstrates the applicability of the NIST Risk Management Framework in the selection,
implementation, assessment, and ongoing monitoring of privacy controls deployed in federal
information systems, programs, and organizations; and

•

Promotes closer cooperation between privacy and security officials within the federal
government to help achieve the objectives of senior leaders/executives in enforcing the
requirements in federal privacy legislation, policies, regulations, directives, standards, and
guidance.

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

HOW TO USE THIS APPENDIX
The privacy controls outlined in this publication are primarily for use by an organization’s Senior
Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) when working with program
managers, mission/business owners, information owners/stewards, Chief Information Officers,
Chief Information Security Officers, information system developers/integrators, and risk executives
to determine how best to incorporate effective privacy protections and practices (i.e., privacy
controls) within organizational programs and information systems and the environments in which
they operate. The privacy controls facilitate the organization’s efforts to comply with privacy
requirements affecting those organizational programs and/or systems that collect, use, maintain,
share, or dispose of personally identifiable information (PII) or other activities that raise privacy
risks. While the security controls in Appendix F are allocated to the low, moderate, and high
baselines in Appendix D, the privacy controls are selected and implemented based on the privacy
requirements of organizations and the need to protect the PII of individuals collected and
maintained by organizational information systems and programs, in accordance with federal privacy
legislation, policies, directives, regulations, guidelines, and best practices.
Organizations analyze and apply each privacy control with respect to their distinct mission/business
and operational needs based on their legal authorities and obligations. Implementation of the
privacy controls may vary based upon this analysis (e.g., organizations that are defined as covered
entities pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] may have
additional requirements that are not specifically enumerated in this publication). This enables
organizations to determine the information practices that are compliant with law and policy and
those that may need review. It also enables organizations to tailor the privacy controls to meet their
defined and specific needs at the organization level, mission/business process level, and information
system level. Organizations with national security or law enforcement authorities take those
authorities as well as privacy interests into account in determining how to apply the privacy controls
in their operational environments. Similarly, organizations subject to the Confidential Information
Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA), implement the privacy controls consistent with
that Act. All organizations implement the privacy controls consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974,
5 U.S.C. § 552a, subject to any exceptions and/or exemptions.
Privacy control enhancements described in Appendix J reflect best practices which organizations
should strive to achieve, but are not mandatory. Organizations should decide when to apply control
enhancements to support their particular missions/business functions. Specific overlays for privacy,
developed in accordance with the guidance in Section 3.2 and Appendix I, can also be considered to
facilitate the tailoring of the security control baselines in Appendix D with the requisite privacy
controls to ensure that both security and privacy requirements can be satisfied by organizations.
Many of the security controls in Appendix F provide the fundamental information protection for
confidentiality, integrity, and availability within organizational information systems and the
environments in which those systems operate—protection that is essential for strong and effective
privacy.
Organizations document the agreed upon privacy controls to be implemented in organizational
programs and information systems and the environments in which they operate. At the discretion of
the implementing organization, privacy controls may be documented in a distinct privacy plan or
incorporated into other risk management documents (e.g., system security plans). Organizations
also establish appropriate assessment methodologies to determine the extent to which the privacy
controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with
respect to meeting designated privacy requirements. Organizational assessments of privacy controls
can be conducted either by the SAOP/CPO alone or jointly with the other organizational risk
management offices including the information security office.

Implementation Tip
•

Select and implement privacy controls based on the privacy requirements of organizations and
the need to protect the personally identifiable information (PII) of individuals collected and
maintained by systems and programs.

•

Coordinate privacy control selection and implementation with the organizational Risk Executive
Function, mission/business owners, enterprise architects, Chief Information Officer, SAOP/CPO,
and Chief Information Security Officer.

•

View the privacy controls in Appendix J from the same perspective as the Program
Management controls in Appendix G—that is, the controls are implemented for each
organizational information system irrespective of the FIPS 199 categorization for that system.

•

Select and implement the optional privacy control enhancements when there is a demonstrated
need for additional privacy protection for individuals and PII.

•

Apply the privacy controls consistent with any specific exceptions and exemptions included in
legislation, Executive Orders, directives, policies, and regulations (e.g., law enforcement or
national security considerations).

FAMILY: AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE

This family ensures that organizations: (i) identify the legal bases that authorize a particular personally
identifiable information (PII) collection or activity that impacts privacy; and (ii) specify in their notices
the purpose(s) for which PII is collected.

AP-1

AUTHORITY TO COLLECT

The organization determines and documents the legal authority that permits the collection,
use, maintenance, and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII), either generally or in
support of a specific program or information system need.

Control:

Before collecting PII, the organization determines whether the
contemplated collection of PII is legally authorized. Program officials consult with the Senior
Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and legal counsel regarding the
authority of any program or activity to collect PII. The authority to collect PII is documented in
the System of Records Notice (SORN) and/or Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) or other
applicable documentation such as Privacy Act Statements or Computer Matching Agreements.
Related controls: AR-2, DM-1, TR-1, TR-2.
Supplemental Guidance:

Control Enhancements:

None.

References: The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (e); Section 208(c), E-Government Act of
2002 (P.L. 107-347); OMB Circular A-130, Appendix I.

AP-2

PURPOSE SPECIFICATION

The organization describes the purpose(s) for which personally identifiable information
(PII) is collected, used, maintained, and shared in its privacy notices.

Control:

Often, statutory language expressly authorizes specific collections and uses
of PII. When statutory language is written broadly and thus subject to interpretation, organizations
ensure, in consultation with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer
(CPO) and legal counsel, that there is a close nexus between the general authorization and any
specific collection of PII. Once the specific purposes have been identified, the purposes are clearly
described in the related privacy compliance documentation, including but not limited to Privacy
Impact Assessments (PIAs), System of Records Notices (SORNs), and Privacy Act Statements
provided at the time of collection (e.g., on forms organizations use to collect PII). Further, in order
to avoid unauthorized collections or uses of PII, personnel who handle PII receive training on the
organizational authorities for collecting PII, authorized uses of PII, and on the contents of the
notice. Related controls: AR-2, AR-4, AR-5, DM-1, DM-2, TR-1, TR-2, UL-1, UL-2.

FAMILY: ACCOUNTABILITY, AUDIT, AND RISK MANAGEMENT

This family enhances public confidence through effective controls for governance, monitoring, risk
management, and assessment to demonstrate that organizations are complying with applicable privacy
protection requirements and minimizing overall privacy risk.

AR-1

GOVERNANCE AND PRIVACY PROGRAM
Control:

The organization:

a.

Appoints a Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO)
accountable for developing, implementing, and maintaining an organization-wide governance
and privacy program to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding
the collection, use, maintenance, sharing, and disposal of personally identifiable information
(PII) by programs and information systems;

b.

Monitors federal privacy laws and policy for changes that affect the privacy program;

c.

Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined allocation of budget and staffing] sufficient
resources to implement and operate the organization-wide privacy program;

d.

Develops a strategic organizational privacy plan for implementing applicable privacy
controls, policies, and procedures;

e.

Develops, disseminates, and implements operational privacy policies and procedures that
govern the appropriate privacy and security controls for programs, information systems, or
technologies involving PII; and

f.

Updates privacy plan, policies, and procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency,
at least biennially].

Supplemental Guidance: The development and implementation of a comprehensive governance and
privacy program demonstrates organizational accountability for and commitment to the protection
of individual privacy. Accountability begins with the appointment of an SAOP/CPO with the
authority, mission, resources, and responsibility to develop and implement a multifaceted privacy
program. The SAOP/CPO, in consultation with legal counsel, information security officials, and
others as appropriate: (i) ensures the development, implementation, and enforcement of privacy
policies and procedures; (ii) defines roles and responsibilities for protecting PII; (iii) determines
the level of information sensitivity with regard to PII holdings; (iv) identifies the laws, regulations,
and internal policies that apply to the PII; (v) monitors privacy best practices; and (vi)
monitors/audits compliance with identified privacy controls.

To further accountability, the SAOP/CPO develops privacy plans to document the privacy
requirements of organizations and the privacy and security controls in place or planned for
meeting those requirements. The plan serves as evidence of organizational privacy operations and
supports resource requests by the SAOP/CPO. A single plan or multiple plans may be necessary
depending upon the organizational structures, requirements, and resources, and the plan(s) may
vary in comprehensiveness. For example, a one-page privacy plan may cover privacy policies,
documentation, and controls already in place, such as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) and
System of Records Notices (SORN). A comprehensive plan may include a baseline of privacy
controls selected from this appendix and include: (i) processes for conducting privacy risk
assessments; (ii) templates and guidance for completing PIAs and SORNs; (iii) privacy training
and awareness requirements; (iv) requirements for contractors processing PII; (v) plans for
eliminating unnecessary PII holdings; and (vi) a framework for measuring annual performance
goals and objectives for implementing identified privacy controls.

PRIVACY IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT
Control:

The organization:

a.

Documents and implements a privacy risk management process that assesses privacy risk to
individuals resulting from the collection, sharing, storing, transmitting, use, and disposal of
personally identifiable information (PII); and

b.

Conducts Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for information systems, programs, or other
activities that pose a privacy risk in accordance with applicable law, OMB policy, or any
existing organizational policies and procedures.

Supplemental Guidance: Organizational privacy risk management processes operate across the life
cycles of all mission/business processes that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of PII. The
tools and processes for managing risk are specific to organizational missions and resources. They
include, but are not limited to, the conduct of PIAs. The PIA is both a process and the document
that is the outcome of that process. OMB Memorandum 03-22 provides guidance to organizations
for implementing the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, including guidance on
when PIAs are required for information systems. Some organizations may be required by law or
policy to extend the PIA requirement to other activities involving PII or otherwise impacting
privacy (e.g., programs, projects, or regulations). PIAs are conducted to identify privacy risks and
identify methods to mitigate those risks. PIAs are also conducted to ensure that programs or
information systems comply with legal, regulatory, and policy requirements. PIAs also serve as
notice to the public of privacy practices. PIAs are performed before developing or procuring
information systems, or initiating programs or projects, that collect, use, maintain, or share PII and
are updated when changes create new privacy risks.

PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS
Control:

The organization:

a.

Establishes privacy roles, responsibilities, and access requirements for contractors and service
providers; and

b.

Includes privacy requirements in contracts and other acquisition-related documents.

Contractors and service providers include, but are not limited to,
information providers, information processors, and other organizations providing information
system development, information technology services, and other outsourced
applications. Organizations consult with legal counsel, the Senior Agency Official for Privacy
(SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), and contracting officers about applicable laws, directives,
policies, or regulations that may impact implementation of this control. Related control: AR-1,
AR-5, SA-4.

PRIVACY MONITORING AND AUDITING

The organization monitors and audits privacy controls and internal privacy policy
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to ensure effective implementation.

Control:

To promote accountability, organizations identify and address gaps in
privacy compliance, management, operational, and technical controls by conducting regular
assessments (e.g., internal risk assessments). These assessments can be self-assessments or thirdparty audits that result in reports on compliance gaps identified in programs, projects, and
information systems. In addition to auditing for effective implementation of all privacy controls
identified in this appendix, organizations assess whether they: (i) implement a process to embed
privacy considerations into the life cycle of personally identifiable information (PII), programs,
information systems, mission/business processes, and technology; (ii) monitor for changes to
applicable privacy laws, regulations, and policies; (iii) track programs, information systems, and
applications that collect and maintain PII to ensure compliance; (iv) ensure that access to PII is
only on a need-to-know basis; and (v) ensure that PII is being maintained and used only for the
legally authorized purposes identified in the public notice(s).

Supplemental Guidance:

Organizations also: (i) implement technology to audit for the security, appropriate use, and loss of
PII; (ii) perform reviews to ensure physical security of documents containing PII; (iii) assess
contractor compliance with privacy requirements; and (iv) ensure that corrective actions identified
as part of the assessment process are tracked and monitored until audit findings are corrected. The
organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) coordinates
monitoring and auditing efforts with information security officials and ensures that the results are
provided to senior managers and oversight officials. Related controls: AR-6, AR-7, AU-1, AU-2,

PRIVACY AWARENESS AND TRAINING
Control:

The organization:

a.

Develops, implements, and updates a comprehensive training and awareness strategy aimed at
ensuring that personnel understand privacy responsibilities and procedures;

b.

Administers basic privacy training [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least
annually] and targeted, role-based privacy training for personnel having responsibility for
personally identifiable information (PII) or for activities that involve PII [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency, at least annually]; and

c.

Ensures that personnel certify (manually or electronically) acceptance of responsibilities for
privacy requirements [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually].

Supplemental Guidance: Through implementation of a privacy training and awareness strategy, the
organization promotes a culture of privacy. Privacy training and awareness programs typically
focus on broad topics, such as responsibilities under the Privacy Act of 1974 and E-Government
Act of 2002 and the consequences of failing to carry out those responsibilities, how to identify
new privacy risks, how to mitigate privacy risks, and how and when to report privacy incidents.
Privacy training may also target data collection and use requirements identified in public notices,
such as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) or System of Records Notices (SORNs) for a program
or information system. Specific training methods may include: (i) mandatory annual privacy

PRIVACY REPORTING

The organization develops, disseminates, and updates reports to the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB), Congress, and other oversight bodies, as appropriate, to
demonstrate accountability with specific statutory and regulatory privacy program mandates, and
to senior management and other personnel with responsibility for monitoring privacy program
progress and compliance.

Control:

Through internal and external privacy reporting, organizations promote
accountability and transparency in organizational privacy operations. Reporting also helps
organizations to determine progress in meeting privacy compliance requirements and privacy
controls, compare performance across the federal government, identify vulnerabilities and gaps in
policy and implementation, and identify success models. Types of privacy reports include: (i)
annual Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) reports to OMB; (ii) reports to Congress
required by the Implementing Regulations of the 9/11 Commission Act; and (iii) other public
reports required by specific statutory mandates or internal policies of organizations. The
organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) consults
with legal counsel, where appropriate, to ensure that organizations meet all applicable privacy
reporting requirements.

PRIVACY-ENHANCED SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT

The organization designs information systems to support privacy by automating privacy
controls.

Control:

To the extent feasible, when designing organizational information systems,
organizations employ technologies and system capabilities that automate privacy controls on the
collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). By building
privacy controls into system design and development, organizations mitigate privacy risks to PII,
thereby reducing the likelihood of information system breaches and other privacy-related
incidents. Organizations also conduct periodic reviews of systems to determine the need for
updates to maintain compliance with the Privacy Act and the organization’s privacy policy.
Regardless of whether automated privacy controls are employed, organizations regularly monitor
information system use and sharing of PII to ensure that the use/sharing is consistent with the
authorized purposes identified in the Privacy Act and/or in the public notice of organizations, or in
a manner compatible with those purposes. Related controls: AC-6, AR-4, AR-5, DM-2, TR-1.

ACCOUNTING OF DISCLOSURES
Control:

a.

The organization:

Keeps an accurate accounting of disclosures of information held in each system of records
under its control, including:
(1) Date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record; and
(2) Name and address of the person or agency to which the disclosure was made;

b.

Retains the accounting of disclosures for the life of the record or five years after the
disclosure is made, whichever is longer; and

c.

Makes the accounting of disclosures available to the person named in the record upon request.

The Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer
(CPO) periodically consults with managers of organization systems of record to ensure that the
required accountings of disclosures of records are being properly maintained and provided to
persons named in those records consistent with the dictates of the Privacy Act. Organizations are
not required to keep an accounting of disclosures when the disclosures are made to individuals
with a need to know, are made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, or are made to a law
enforcement agency pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552a(c)(3). Heads of agencies can promulgate rules to

FAMILY: DATA QUALITY AND INTEGRITY

This family enhances public confidence that any personally identifiable information (PII) collected and
maintained by organizations is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete for the purpose for which it is to
be used, as specified in public notices.

DI-1

DATA QUALITY
Control:

The organization:

a.

Confirms to the greatest extent practicable upon collection or creation of personally
identifiable information (PII), the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of that
information;

b.

Collects PII directly from the individual to the greatest extent practicable;

c.

Checks for, and corrects as necessary, any inaccurate or outdated PII used by its programs or
systems [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

d.

Issues guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality, utility, objectivity, and integrity of
disseminated information.

Organizations take reasonable steps to confirm the accuracy and relevance
of PII. Such steps may include, for example, editing and validating addresses as they are collected
or entered into information systems using automated address verification look-up application
programming interfaces (API). The types of measures taken to protect data quality are based on
the nature and context of the PII, how it is to be used, and how it was obtained. Measures taken to
validate the accuracy of PII that is used to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or
privileges of individuals under federal programs may be more comprehensive than those used to
validate less sensitive PII. Additional steps may be necessary to validate PII that is obtained from
sources other than individuals or the authorized representatives of individuals.

Supplemental Guidance:

When PII is of a sufficiently sensitive nature (e.g., when it is used for annual reconfirmation of a
taxpayer’s income for a recurring benefit), organizations incorporate mechanisms into information
systems and develop corresponding procedures for how frequently, and by what method, the
information is to be updated. Related controls: AP-2, DI-2, DM-1, IP-3, SI-10.

FAMILY: DATA MINIMIZATION AND RETENTION

This family helps organizations implement the data minimization and retention requirements to collect,
use, and retain only personally identifiable information (PII) that is relevant and necessary for the
purpose for which it was originally collected. Organizations retain PII for only as long as necessary to
fulfill the purpose(s) specified in public notices and in accordance with a National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA)-approved record retention schedule.

DM-1

MINIMIZATION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
Control:

The organization:

a.

Identifies the minimum personally identifiable information (PII) elements that are relevant
and necessary to accomplish the legally authorized purpose of collection;

b.

Limits the collection and retention of PII to the minimum elements identified for the purposes
described in the notice and for which the individual has provided consent; and

c.

Conducts an initial evaluation of PII holdings and establishes and follows a schedule for
regularly reviewing those holdings [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least
annually] to ensure that only PII identified in the notice is collected and retained, and that the
PII continues to be necessary to accomplish the legally authorized purpose.

Organizations take appropriate steps to ensure that the collection of PII is
consistent with a purpose authorized by law or regulation. The minimum set of PII elements
required to support a specific organization business process may be a subset of the PII the
organization is authorized to collect. Program officials consult with the Senior Agency Official for
Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and legal counsel to identify the minimum PII
elements required by the information system or activity to accomplish the legally authorized
purpose.
Supplemental Guidance:

Organizations can further reduce their privacy and security risks by also reducing their inventory
of PII, where appropriate. OMB Memorandum 07-16 requires organizations to conduct both an
initial review and subsequent reviews of their holdings of all PII and ensure, to the maximum
extent practicable, that such holdings are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Organizations
are also directed by OMB to reduce their holdings to the minimum necessary for the proper
performance of a documented organizational business purpose. OMB Memorandum 07-16
requires organizations to develop and publicize, either through a notice in the Federal Register or
on their websites, a schedule for periodic reviews of their holdings to supplement the initial
review. Organizations coordinate with their federal records officers to ensure that reductions in
organizational holdings of PII are consistent with NARA retention schedules.
By performing periodic evaluations, organizations reduce risk, ensure that they are collecting only
the data specified in the notice, and ensure that the data collected is still relevant and necessary for
the purpose(s) specified in the notice. Related controls: AP-1, AP-2, AR-4, IP-1, SE-1, SI-12, TR1.

DATA RETENTION AND DISPOSAL
Control:

The organization:

a.

Retains each collection of personally identifiable information (PII) for [Assignment:
organization-defined time period] to fulfill the purpose(s) identified in the notice or as
required by law;

b.

Disposes of, destroys, erases, and/or anonymizes the PII, regardless of the method of storage,
in accordance with a NARA-approved record retention schedule and in a manner that prevents
loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access; and

c.

Uses [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or methods] to ensure secure deletion or
destruction of PII (including originals, copies, and archived records).

NARA provides retention schedules that govern the disposition of federal
records. Program officials coordinate with records officers and with NARA to identify appropriate
retention periods and disposal methods. NARA may require organizations to retain PII longer than
is operationally needed. In those situations, organizations describe such requirements in the notice.
Methods of storage include, for example, electronic, optical media, or paper.

Supplemental Guidance:

Examples of ways organizations may reduce holdings include reducing the types of PII held (e.g.,
delete Social Security numbers if their use is no longer needed) or shortening the retention period
for PII that is maintained if it is no longer necessary to keep PII for long periods of time (this
effort is undertaken in consultation with an organization’s records officer to receive NARA
approval). In both examples, organizations provide notice (e.g., an updated System of Records
Notice) to inform the public of any changes in holdings of PII.
Certain read-only archiving techniques, such as DVDs, CDs, microfilm, or microfiche, may not
permit the removal of individual records without the destruction of the entire database contained
on such media. Related controls: AR-4, AU-11, DM-1, MP-1, MP-2, MP-3, MP-4, MP-5, MP-6,

(PII) for testing, training, and research; and

b.

Implements controls to protect PII used for testing, training, and research.

Organizations often use PII for testing new applications or information
systems prior to deployment. Organizations also use PII for research purposes and for training.
The use of PII in testing, research, and training increases risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse
of the information. If PII must be used, organizations take measures to minimize any associated
risks and to authorize the use of and limit the amount of PII for these purposes. Organizations
consult with the SAOP/CPO and legal counsel to ensure that the use of PII in testing, training, and
research is compatible with the original purpose for which it was collected.

FAMILY: INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATION AND REDRESS

This family addresses the need to make individuals active participants in the decision-making process
regarding the collection and use of their personally identifiable information (PII). By providing
individuals with access to PII and the ability to have their PII corrected or amended, as appropriate, the
controls in this family enhance public confidence in organizational decisions made based on the PII.

IP-1

CONSENT
Control:

The organization:

a.

Provides means, where feasible and appropriate, for individuals to authorize the collection,
use, maintaining, and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII) prior to its
collection;

b.

Provides appropriate means for individuals to understand the consequences of decisions to
approve or decline the authorization of the collection, use, dissemination, and retention of PII;

c.

Obtains consent, where feasible and appropriate, from individuals prior to any new uses or
disclosure of previously collected PII; and

d.

Ensures that individuals are aware of and, where feasible, consent to all uses of PII not
initially described in the public notice that was in effect at the time the organization collected
the PII.

Supplemental Guidance: Consent is fundamental to the participation of individuals in the decisionmaking process regarding the collection and use of their PII and the use of technologies that may
increase risk to personal privacy. To obtain consent, organizations provide individuals appropriate
notice of the purposes of the PII collection or technology use and a means for individuals to
consent to the activity. Organizations tailor the public notice and consent mechanisms to meet
operational needs. Organizations achieve awareness and consent, for example, through updated
public notices.
Organizations may obtain consent through opt-in, opt-out, or implied consent. Opt-in consent is
the preferred method, but it is not always feasible. Opt-in requires that individuals take affirmative
action to allow organizations to collect or use PII. For example, opt-in consent may require an
individual to click a radio button on a website, or sign a document providing consent. In contrast,
opt-out requires individuals to take action to prevent the new or continued collection or use of
such PII. For example, the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call Registry allows individuals
to opt-out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls by requesting to be added to a list. Implied
consent is the least preferred method and should be used in limited circumstances. Implied consent
occurs where individuals’ behavior or failure to object indicates agreement with the collection or
use of PII (e.g., by entering and remaining in a building where notice has been posted that security
cameras are in use, the individual implies consent to the video recording). Depending upon the
nature of the program or information system, it may be appropriate to allow individuals to limit
the types of PII they provide and subsequent uses of that PII. Organizational consent mechanisms
include a discussion of the consequences to individuals of failure to provide PII. Consequences
can vary from organization to organization. Related controls: AC-2, AP-1, TR-1, TR-2.

Organizations can provide, for example, individuals’ itemized choices
as to whether they wish to be contacted for any of a variety of purposes. In this situation,
organizations construct consent mechanisms to ensure that organizational operations comply
with individual choices.

The organization:

a.

Provides individuals the ability to have access to their personally identifiable information
(PII) maintained in its system(s) of records;

b.

Publishes rules and regulations governing how individuals may request access to records
maintained in a Privacy Act system of records;

c.

Publishes access procedures in System of Records Notices (SORNs); and

d.

Adheres to Privacy Act requirements and OMB policies and guidance for the proper
processing of Privacy Act requests.

Access affords individuals the ability to review PII about them held within
organizational systems of records. Access includes timely, simplified, and inexpensive access to
data. Organizational processes for allowing access to records may differ based on resources, legal
requirements, or other factors. The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief
Privacy Officer (CPO) is responsible for the content of Privacy Act regulations and record request
processing, in consultation with legal counsel. Access to certain types of records may not be
appropriate, however, and heads of agencies may promulgate rules exempting particular systems
from the access provision of the Privacy Act. In addition, individuals are not entitled to access to
information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. Related controls:

REDRESS
Control:

The organization:

a.

Provides a process for individuals to have inaccurate personally identifiable information (PII)
maintained by the organization corrected or amended, as appropriate; and

b.

Establishes a process for disseminating corrections or amendments of the PII to other
authorized users of the PII, such as external information-sharing partners and, where feasible
and appropriate, notifies affected individuals that their information has been corrected or
amended.

Supplemental Guidance: Redress supports the ability of individuals to ensure the accuracy of PII
held by organizations. Effective redress processes demonstrate organizational commitment to data
quality especially in those business functions where inaccurate data may result in inappropriate
decisions or denial of benefits and services to individuals. Organizations use discretion in
determining if records are to be corrected or amended, based on the scope of redress requests, the
changes sought, and the impact of the changes. Individuals may appeal an adverse decision and
have incorrect information amended, where appropriate.

To provide effective redress, organizations: (i) provide effective notice of the existence of a PII
collection; (ii) provide plain language explanations of the processes and mechanisms for
requesting access to records; (iii) establish criteria for submitting requests for correction or
amendment; (iv) implement resources to analyze and adjudicate requests; (v) implement means of
correcting or amending data collections; and (vi) review any decisions that may have been the
result of inaccurate information.

security requirements for all new or modified information systems containing PII.

Supplemental Guidance: The PII inventory enables organizations to implement effective
administrative, technical, and physical security policies and procedures to protect PII consistent
with Appendix F, and to mitigate risks of PII exposure. As one method of gathering information
for their PII inventories, organizations may extract the following information elements from
Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) for information systems containing PII: (i) the name and
acronym for each system identified; (ii) the types of PII contained in that system; (iii)
classification of level of sensitivity of all types of PII, as combined in that information system; and
(iv) classification of level of potential risk of substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or
unfairness to affected individuals, as well as the financial or reputational risks to organizations, if
PII is exposed. Organizations take due care in updating the inventories by identifying linkable data
that could create PII. Related controls: AR-1, AR-4, AR-5, AT-1, DM-1, PM-5, UL-3.

FAMILY: TRANSPARENCY

This family ensures that organizations provide public notice of their information practices and the
privacy impact of their programs and activities.

TR-1

PRIVACY NOTICE
Control:

The organization:

a.

Provides effective notice to the public and to individuals regarding: (i) its activities that
impact privacy, including its collection, use, sharing, safeguarding, maintenance, and disposal
of personally identifiable information (PII); (ii) authority for collecting PII; (iii) the choices, if
any, individuals may have regarding how the organization uses PII and the consequences of
exercising or not exercising those choices; and (iv) the ability to access and have PII amended
or corrected if necessary;

b.

Describes: (i) the PII the organization collects and the purpose(s) for which it collects that
information; (ii) how the organization uses PII internally; (iii) whether the organization shares
PII with external entities, the categories of those entities, and the purposes for such sharing;
(iv) whether individuals have the ability to consent to specific uses or sharing of PII and how
to exercise any such consent; (v) how individuals may obtain access to PII; and (vi) how the
PII will be protected; and

c.

Revises its public notices to reflect changes in practice or policy that affect PII or changes in
its activities that impact privacy, before or as soon as practicable after the change.

Supplemental Guidance: Effective notice, by virtue of its clarity, readability, and comprehensiveness,
enables individuals to understand how an organization uses PII generally and, where appropriate,
to make an informed decision prior to providing PII to an organization. Effective notice also
demonstrates the privacy considerations that the organization has addressed in implementing its
information practices. The organization may provide general public notice through a variety of
means, as required by law or policy, including System of Records Notices (SORNs), Privacy
Impact Assessments (PIAs), or in a website privacy policy. As required by the Privacy Act, the
organization also provides direct notice to individuals via Privacy Act Statements on the paper and
electronic forms it uses to collect PII, or on separate forms that can be retained by the individuals.

The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) is
responsible for the content of the organization’s public notices, in consultation with legal counsel
and relevant program managers. The public notice requirement in this control is satisfied by an
organization’s compliance with the public notice provisions of the Privacy Act, the E-Government
Act’s PIA requirement, with OMB guidance related to federal agency privacy notices, and, where
applicable, with policy pertaining to participation in the Information Sharing Environment
(ISE). 124 Changing PII practice or policy without prior notice is disfavored and should only be
undertaken in consultation with the SAOP/CPO and counsel. Related controls: AP-1, AP-2, AR-1,
AR-2, IP-1, IP-2, IP-3, UL-1, UL-2.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

PRIVACY NOTICE | REAL-TIME OR LAYERED NOTICE
The organization provides real-time and/or layered notice when it collects PII.

Supplemental Guidance: Real-time notice is defined as notice at the point of collection. A
layered notice approach involves providing individuals with a summary of key points in the
organization’s privacy policy. A second notice provides more detailed/specific information.
124

The Information Sharing Environment is an approach that facilitates the sharing of terrorism and homeland security
information. The ISE was established by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Public Law
108-458, 118 Stat. 3638. See the ISE website at: www.ise.gov.

SYSTEM OF RECORDS NOTICES AND PRIVACY ACT STATEMENTS
Control:

The organization:

a.

Publishes System of Records Notices (SORNs) in the Federal Register, subject to required
oversight processes, for systems containing personally identifiable information (PII);

b.

Keeps SORNs current; and

c.

Includes Privacy Act Statements on its forms that collect PII, or on separate forms that can be
retained by individuals, to provide additional formal notice to individuals from whom the
information is being collected.

Organizations issue SORNs to provide the public notice regarding PII
collected in a system of records, which the Privacy Act defines as “a group of any records under
the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by
some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier.” SORNs explain how the information is
used, retained, and may be corrected, and whether certain portions of the system are subject to
Privacy Act exemptions for law enforcement or national security reasons. Privacy Act Statements
provide notice of: (i) the authority of organizations to collect PII; (ii) whether providing PII is
mandatory or optional; (iii) the principal purpose(s) for which the PII is to be used; (iv) the
intended disclosures (routine uses) of the information; and (v) the consequences of not providing
all or some portion of the information requested. When information is collected verbally,
organizations read a Privacy Act Statement prior to initiating the collection of PII (for example,
when conducting telephone interviews or surveys). Related control: DI-2.

This family ensures that organizations only use personally identifiable information (PII) either as
specified in their public notices, in a manner compatible with those specified purposes, or as otherwise
permitted by law. Implementation of the controls in this family will ensure that the scope of PII use is
limited accordingly.

UL-1

INTERNAL USE
Control: The organization uses personally identifiable information (PII) internally only for the
authorized purpose(s) identified in the Privacy Act and/or in public notices.

Organizations take steps to ensure that they use PII only for legally
authorized purposes and in a manner compatible with uses identified in the Privacy Act and/or in
public notices. These steps include monitoring and auditing organizational use of PII and training
organizational personnel on the authorized uses of PII. With guidance from the Senior Agency
Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and where appropriate, legal counsel,
organizations document processes and procedures for evaluating any proposed new uses of PII to
assess whether they fall within the scope of the organizational authorities. Where appropriate,
organizations obtain consent from individuals for the new use(s) of PII. Related controls: AP-2,

a.

Shares personally identifiable information (PII) externally, only for the authorized purposes
identified in the Privacy Act and/or described in its notice(s) or for a purpose that is
compatible with those purposes;

b.

Where appropriate, enters into Memoranda of Understanding, Memoranda of Agreement,
Letters of Intent, Computer Matching Agreements, or similar agreements, with third parties
that specifically describe the PII covered and specifically enumerate the purposes for which
the PII may be used;

c.

Monitors, audits, and trains its staff on the authorized sharing of PII with third parties and on
the consequences of unauthorized use or sharing of PII; and

d.

Evaluates any proposed new instances of sharing PII with third parties to assess whether the
sharing is authorized and whether additional or new public notice is required.

The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief
Privacy Officer (CPO) and, where appropriate, legal counsel review and approve any proposed
external sharing of PII, including with other public, international, or private sector entities, for
consistency with uses described in the existing organizational public notice(s). When a proposed
new instance of external sharing of PII is not currently authorized by the Privacy Act and/or
specified in a notice, organizations evaluate whether the proposed external sharing is compatible
with the purpose(s) specified in the notice. If the proposed sharing is compatible, organizations
review, update, and republish their Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), System of Records
Notices (SORNs), website privacy policies, and other public notices, if any, to include specific
descriptions of the new uses(s) and obtain consent where appropriate and feasible. Informationsharing agreements also include security protections consistent with the sensitivity of the
information being shared. Related controls: AR-3, AR-4, AR-5, AR-8, AP-2, DI-1, DI-2, IP-1,

Introduction and PCI Data Security Standard Overview
The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) was developed to encourage and enhance cardholder data security and facilitate
the broad adoption of consistent data security measures globally. PCI DSS provides a baseline of technical and operational requirements
designed to protect cardholder data. PCI DSS applies to all entities involved in payment card processing – including merchants, processors,
acquirers, issuers, and service providers, as well as all other entities that store, process or transmit cardholder data. PCI DSS comprises a
minimum set of requirements for protecting cardholder data, and may be enhanced by additional controls and practices to further mitigate risks.
Below is a high-level overview of the 12 PCI DSS requirements.

This document, PCI Data Security Standard Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures, combines the 12 PCI DSS requirements and
corresponding testing procedures into a security assessment tool. It is designed for use during PCI DSS compliance assessments as part of an
entity’s validation process. The following sections provide detailed guidelines and best practices to assist entities prepare for, conduct, and report
the results of a PCI DSS assessment. The PCI DSS Requirements and Testing Procedures begin on page 19.

PCI DSS Applicability Information
PCI DSS applies wherever account data is stored, processed or transmitted. Account Data consists of Cardholder Data plus Sensitive
Authentication Data, as follows:
Cardholder Data includes:


Primary Account Number (PAN)



Cardholder Name




Sensitive Authentication Data includes:


Full magnetic stripe data or equivalent
on a chip

Expiration Date



CAV2/CVC2/CVV2/CID

Service Code



PINs/PIN blocks

The primary account number is the defining factor in the applicability of PCI DSS requirements. PCI DSS requirements are applicable if a
primary account number (PAN) is stored, processed, or transmitted. If PAN is not stored, processed or transmitted, PCI DSS requirements do not
apply.
If cardholder name, service code, and/or expiration date are stored, processed or transmitted with the PAN, or are otherwise present in the
cardholder data environment, they must be protected in accordance with all PCI DSS requirements except Requirements 3.3 and 3.4, which apply
only to PAN.
PCI DSS represents a minimum set of control objectives which may be enhanced by local, regional and sector laws and regulations. Additionally,
legislation or regulatory requirements may require specific protection of personally identifiable information or other data elements (for example,
cardholder name), or define an entity’s disclosure practices related to consumer information. Examples include legislation related to consumer
data protection, privacy, identity theft, or data security. PCI DSS does not supersede local or regional laws, government regulations, or other legal
requirements.
The following table illustrates commonly used elements of cardholder and sensitive authentication data, whether storage of each data element is
permitted or prohibited, and whether each data element must be protected. This table is not exhaustive, but is presented to illustrate the different
types of requirements that apply to each data element.

Relationship between PCI DSS and PA-DSS
Use of a PA-DSS compliant application by itself does not make an entity PCI DSS compliant, since that application must be implemented into a
PCI DSS compliant environment and according to the PA-DSS Implementation Guide provided by the payment application vendor (per PA-DSS
Requirement 13.1).
The requirements for the Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS) are derived from the PCI DSS Requirements and Security
Assessment Procedures (this document). The PA-DSS details what a payment application must support to facilitate a customer’s PCI DSS
compliance.
Secure payment applications, when implemented in a PCI DSS-compliant environment, will minimize the potential for security breaches leading to
compromises of full magnetic stripe data, card verification codes and values (CAV2, CID, CVC2, CVV2), and PINs and PIN blocks, along with the
damaging fraud resulting from these breaches.
Just a few of the ways payment applications can prevent compliance include:


Storage of magnetic stripe data and/or equivalent data from the chip in the customer's network after authorization;



Applications that require customers to disable other features required by the PCI DSS, like anti-virus software or firewalls, in order to get
the payment application to work properly; and



Vendors’ use of unsecured methods to connect to the application to provide support to the customer.

The PA-DSS applies to software vendors and others who develop payment applications that store, process, or transmit cardholder data as part of
authorization or settlement, where these payment applications are sold, distributed, or licensed to third parties.
Please note the following regarding PA-DSS applicability:


PA-DSS does apply to payment applications that are typically sold and installed ―off the shelf‖ without much customization by software
vendors.



PA-DSS does not apply to payment applications developed by merchants and service providers if used only in-house (not sold,
distributed, or licensed to a third party), since this in-house developed payment application would be covered as part of the merchant’s or
service provider’s normal PCI DSS compliance.

For detailed guidance on determining whether PA-DSS applies to a given payment application, please refer to the PA-DSS Requirements and
Security Assessment Procedures, which can be found at www.pcisecuritystandards.org.

Scope of Assessment for Compliance with PCI DSS Requirements
The PCI DSS security requirements apply to all system components. In the context of PCI DSS, ―system components‖ are defined as any network
component, server, or application that is included in or connected to the cardholder data environment. ―System components‖ also include any
virtualization components such as virtual machines, virtual switches/routers, virtual appliances, virtual applications/desktops, and hypervisors. The
cardholder data environment is comprised of people, processes and technology that store, process or transmit cardholder data or sensitive
authentication data. Network components include but are not limited to firewalls, switches, routers, wireless access points, network appliances,
and other security appliances. Server types include, but are not limited to the following: web, application, database, authentication, mail, proxy,
network time protocol (NTP), and domain name server (DNS). Applications include all purchased and custom applications, including internal and
external (for example, Internet) applications.
The first step of a PCI DSS assessment is to accurately determine the scope of the review. At least annually and prior to the annual assessment,
the assessed entity should confirm the accuracy of their PCI DSS scope by identifying all locations and flows of cardholder data and ensuring they
are included in the PCI DSS scope. To confirm the accuracy and appropriateness of PCI DSS scope, perform the following:


The assessed entity identifies and documents the existence of all cardholder data in their environment, to verify that no cardholder data
exists outside of the currently defined cardholder data environment (CDE).



Once all locations of cardholder data are identified and documented, the entity uses the results to verify that PCI DSS scope is appropriate
(for example, the results may be a diagram or an inventory of cardholder data locations).



The entity considers any cardholder data found to be in scope of the PCI DSS assessment and part of the CDE unless such data is
deleted or migrated/consolidated into the currently defined CDE.



The entity retains documentation that shows how PCI DSS scope was confirmed and the results, for assessor review and/or for reference
during the next annual PCI SCC scope confirmation activity.

Network Segmentation
Network segmentation of, or isolating (segmenting), the cardholder data environment from the remainder of an entity’s network is not a PCI DSS
requirement. However, it is strongly recommended as a method that may reduce:


The scope of the PCI DSS assessment



The cost of the PCI DSS assessment



The cost and difficulty of implementing and maintaining PCI DSS controls



The risk to an organization (reduced by consolidating cardholder data into fewer, more controlled locations)

Page 10

Without adequate network segmentation (sometimes called a "flat network") the entire network is in scope of the PCI DSS assessment. Network
segmentation can be achieved through a number of physical or logical means, such as properly configured internal network firewalls, routers with
strong access control lists, or other technologies that restrict access to a particular segment of a network.
An important prerequisite to reduce the scope of the cardholder data environment is a clear understanding of business needs and processes
related to the storage, processing or transmission of cardholder data. Restricting cardholder data to as few locations as possible by elimination of
unnecessary data, and consolidation of necessary data, may require reengineering of long-standing business practices.
Documenting cardholder data flows via a dataflow diagram helps fully understand all cardholder data flows and ensures that any network
segmentation is effective at isolating the cardholder data environment.
If network segmentation is in place and being used to reduce the scope of the PCI DSS assessment, the assessor must verify that the
segmentation is adequate to reduce the scope of the assessment. At a high level, adequate network segmentation isolates systems that store,
process, or transmit cardholder data from those that do not. However, the adequacy of a specific implementation of network segmentation is highly
variable and dependent upon a number of factors, such as a given network's configuration, the technologies deployed, and other controls that may
be implemented.
Appendix D: Segmentation and Sampling of Business Facilities/System Components provides more information on the effect of network
segmentation and sampling on the scope of a PCI DSS assessment.

Wireless
If wireless technology is used to store, process, or transmit cardholder data (for example, point-of-sale transactions, ―line-busting‖), or if a wireless
local area network (WLAN) is connected to, or part of, the cardholder data environment (for example, not clearly separated by a firewall), the PCI
DSS requirements and testing procedures for wireless environments apply and must be performed (for example, Requirements 1.2.3, 2.1.1, and
4.1.1). Before wireless technology is implemented, an entity should carefully evaluate the need for the technology against the risk. Consider
deploying wireless technology only for non-sensitive data transmission.

Third Parties/Outsourcing
For service providers required to undergo an annual onsite assessment, compliance validation must be performed on all system components in
the cardholder data environment.
A service provider or merchant may use a third-party service provider to store, process, or transmit cardholder data on their behalf, or to manage
components such as routers, firewalls, databases, physical security, and/or servers. If so, there may be an impact on the security of the cardholder
data environment.
For those entities that outsource storage, processing, or transmission of cardholder data to third-party service providers, the Report on
Compliance (ROC) must document the role of each service provider, clearly identifying which requirements apply to the assessed entity and which
apply to the service provider. There are two options for third-party service providers to validate compliance:

PCI DSS Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures, Version 2.0

Page 11

1) They can undergo a PCI DSS assessment on their own and provide evidence to their customers to demonstrate their compliance; or
2) If they do not undergo their own PCI DSS assessment, they will need to have their services reviewed during the course of each of their
customers’ PCI DSS assessments.
See the bullet beginning ―For managed service provider (MSP) reviews,‖ in Item 3, ―Details about Reviewed Environment,‖ in the ―Instructions and
Content for Report on Compliance‖ section, below, for more information.
Additionally, merchants and service providers must manage and monitor the PCI DSS compliance of all associated third-party service providers
with access to cardholder data. Refer to Requirement 12.8 in this document for details.

Sampling is not a PCI DSS requirement. However, after considering the overall scope and complexity of the environment being assessed, the
assessor may independently select representative samples of business facilities/system components in order to assess PCI DSS requirements.
These samples must be defined first for business facilities and then for system components within each selected business facility. Samples must
be a representative selection of all of the types and locations of business facilities, as well as types of system components within selected
business facilities. Samples must be sufficiently large to provide the assessor with assurance that controls are implemented as expected.
Sampling of business facilities/system components for an assessment does not reduce the scope of the cardholder data environment or the
applicability of PCI DSS requirements. Whether or not sampling is to be used, PCI DSS requirements apply to the entire cardholder data
environment. If sampling is used, each sample must be assessed against all applicable PCI DSS requirements. Sampling of the PCI DSS
Requirements themselves is not permitted.
Examples of business facilities include but are not limited to: corporate offices, stores, franchise locations, processing facilities, data centers, and
other facility types in different locations. Sampling should include system components within each selected business facility. For example, for each
business facility selected, include a variety of operating systems, functions, and applications that are applicable to the area under review.
As an example, the assessor may define a sample at a business facility to include Sun servers running Apache WWW, Windows servers running
Oracle, mainframe systems running legacy card processing applications, data transfer servers running HP-UX, and Linux Servers running
MYSQL. If all applications run from a single version of an OS (for example, Windows 7 or Solaris 10), then the sample should still include a variety
of applications (for example, database servers, web servers, data transfer servers).
When independently selecting samples of business facilities/system components, assessors should consider the following:


If there are standard, centralized PCI DSS security and operational processes and controls in place that ensure consistency and that each
business facility/system component must follow, the sample can be smaller than if there are no standard processes/controls in place. The
sample must be large enough to provide the assessor with reasonable assurance that all business facilities/system components are
configured per the standard processes.



If there is more than one type of standard security and/or operational process in place (for example, for different types of business
facilities/system components), the sample must be large enough to include business facilities/system components secured with each type
of process.



If there are no standard PCI DSS processes/controls in place and each business facility/system component is managed through nonstandard processes, the sample must be larger for the assessor to be assured that each business facility/system component has
implemented PCI DSS requirements appropriately.

For each instance where sampling is used, the assessor must:


Document the rationale behind the sampling technique and sample size,



Document and validate the standardized PCI DSS processes and controls used to determine sample
size, and



Explain how the sample is appropriate and representative of the overall population.

Please also refer to:
Appendix D: Segmentation
and Sampling of Business
Facilities/System
Components.

Assessors must revalidate the sampling rationale for each assessment. If sampling is to be used, different
samples of business facilities and system components must be selected for each assessment.

Compensating Controls
On an annual basis, any compensating controls must be documented, reviewed and validated by the assessor and included with the Report on
Compliance submission, per Appendix B: Compensating Controls and Appendix C: Compensating Controls Worksheet.
For each and every compensating control, the Compensating Controls Worksheet (Appendix C) must be completed. Additionally, compensating
control results should be documented in the ROC in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section.
See the above-mentioned Appendices B and C for more details on ―compensating controls.‖

 Review and document any compensating controls considered to conclude that a control is in place.
See ―Compensating Controls‖ section above and Appendices B and C for more details on compensating controls.

Revalidation of Open Items
A ―controls in place‖ report is required to verify compliance. The report is considered non-compliant if it contains ―open items,‖ or items that will be
finished at a future date. The merchant/service provider must address these items before validation is completed. After open items are addressed
by the merchant/service provider, the assessor will then reassess to validate that the remediation occurred and that all requirements are satisfied.
After revalidation, the assessor will issue a new Report on Compliance, verifying that the cardholder data environment is fully compliant, and
submit it consistent with instructions (see below).

Build and Maintain a Secure Network
Requirement 1: Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data
Firewalls are devices that control computer traffic allowed between an entity’s networks (internal) and untrusted networks (external), as well as
traffic into and out of more sensitive areas within an entity’s internal trusted networks. The cardholder data environment is an example of a more
sensitive area within an entity’s trusted network.
A firewall examines all network traffic and blocks those transmissions that do not meet the specified security criteria.
All systems must be protected from unauthorized access from untrusted networks, whether entering the system via the Internet as e-commerce,
employee Internet access through desktop browsers, employee e-mail access, dedicated connections such as business-to-business connections,
via wireless networks, or via other sources. Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways
into key systems. Firewalls are a key protection mechanism for any computer network.
Other system components may provide firewall functionality, provided they meet the minimum requirements for firewalls as provided in
Requirement 1. Where other system components are used within the cardholder data environment to provide firewall functionality, these devices
must be included within the scope and assessment of Requirement 1.

Protection methods such as encryption, truncation, masking, and hashing are critical components of cardholder data protection. If an intruder
circumvents other security controls and gains access to encrypted data, without the proper cryptographic keys, the data is unreadable and
unusable to that person. Other effective methods of protecting stored data should be considered as potential risk mitigation opportunities. For
example, methods for minimizing risk include not storing cardholder data unless absolutely necessary, truncating cardholder data if full PAN is not
needed, and not sending unprotected PANs using end-user messaging technologies, such as e-mail and instant messaging.
Please refer to the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms for definitions of ―strong cryptography‖ and other PCI
DSS terms.

3.2.1 Do not store the full contents of
any track (from the magnetic stripe
located on the back of a card,
equivalent data contained on a chip, or
elsewhere). This data is alternatively
called full track, track, track 1, track 2,
and magnetic-stripe data.
Note: In the normal course of business,
the following data elements from the
magnetic stripe may need to be
retained:
 The cardholder‘s name
 Primary account number (PAN)
 Expiration date
 Service code

3.2.a For issuers and/or companies that support issuing services
and store sensitive authentication data, verify there is a business
justification for the storage of sensitive authentication data, and that

Testing Procedures

3.4 Render PAN unreadable anywhere it
is stored (including on portable digital
media, backup media, and in logs) by
using any of the following approaches:
 One-way hashes based on strong
cryptography (hash must be of the
entire PAN)
 Truncation (hashing cannot be used
to replace the truncated segment of
PAN)
 Index tokens and pads (pads must
be securely stored)
 Strong cryptography with associated
key-management processes and
procedures

3.4.a Obtain and examine documentation about the system used to
protect the PAN, including the vendor, type of system/process, and
the encryption algorithms (if applicable). Verify that the PAN is
rendered unreadable using any of the following methods:
 One-way hashes based on strong cryptography
 Truncation
 Index tokens and pads, with the pads being securely stored
 Strong cryptography, with associated key-management
processes and procedures

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a
malicious individual to reconstruct original
PAN data if they have access to both the
truncated and hashed version of a PAN.
Where hashed and truncated versions of
the same PAN are present in an entity‘s
environment, additional controls should
be in place to ensure that the hashed and
truncated versions cannot be correlated
to reconstruct the original PAN.
3.4.1 If disk encryption is used (rather
than file- or column-level database
encryption), logical access must be
managed independently of native
operating system access control
mechanisms (for example, by not using
local user account databases).
Decryption keys must not be tied to
user accounts.

tapes) to confirm that the PAN is rendered unreadable.
3.4.d Examine a sample of audit logs to confirm that the PAN is
rendered unreadable or removed from the logs.

3.4.1.a If disk encryption is used, verify that logical access to
encrypted file systems is implemented via a mechanism that is
separate from the native operating systems mechanism (for
example, not using local user account databases).
3.4.1.b Verify that cryptographic keys are stored securely (for
example, stored on removable media that is adequately protected
with strong access controls).
3.4.1.c Verify that cardholder data on removable media is
encrypted wherever stored.
Note: If disk encryption is not used to encrypt removable media,
the data stored on this media will need to be rendered unreadable
through some other method.

Requirement 6: Develop and maintain secure systems and applications
Unscrupulous individuals use security vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to systems. Many of these vulnerabilities are fixed by vendorprovided security patches, which must be installed by the entities that manage the systems. All critical systems must have the most recently
released, appropriate software patches to protect against exploitation and compromise of cardholder data by malicious individuals and malicious
software.
Note: Appropriate software patches are those patches that have been evaluated and tested sufficiently to determine that the patches do not
conflict with existing security configurations. For in-house developed applications, numerous vulnerabilities can be avoided by using standard
system development processes and secure coding techniques.

Testing Procedures

6.1 Ensure that all system components
and software are protected from known
vulnerabilities by having the latest
vendor-supplied security patches
installed. Install critical security patches

Note: An organization may consider
applying a risk-based approach to
prioritize their patch installations. For
example, by prioritizing critical
infrastructure (for example, public-facing
devices and systems, databases) higher
than less-critical internal devices, to
ensure high-priority systems and devices
are addressed within one month, and
addressing less critical devices and

Implement Strong Access Control Measures
Requirement 7: Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know
To ensure critical data can only be accessed by authorized personnel, systems and processes must be in place to limit access based on need to
know and according to job responsibilities.
―Need to know‖ is when access rights are granted to only the least amount of data and privileges needed to perform a job.
PCI DSS Requirements
7.1 Limit access to system components
and cardholder data to only those
individuals whose job requires such
access. Access limitations must include
the following:

Testing Procedures

7.1.1 Confirm that access rights for privileged user IDs are
restricted to least privileges necessary to perform job
responsibilities.

7.1.2 Assignment of privileges is based
on individual personnel’s job
classification and function

7.1.2 Confirm that privileges are assigned to individuals based on
job classification and function (also called ―role-based access
control‖ or RBAC).

7.1.3 Requirement for a documented
approval by authorized parties
specifying required privileges.

7.1.3 Confirm that documented approval by authorized parties is
required (in writing or electronically) for all access, and that it must
specify required privileges.

Requirement 8: Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access
Assigning a unique identification (ID) to each person with access ensures that each individual is uniquely accountable for his or her actions. When
such accountability is in place, actions taken on critical data and systems are performed by, and can be traced to, known and authorized users.
Note: These requirements are applicable for all accounts, including point-of-sale accounts, with administrative capabilities and all accounts used
to view or access cardholder data or to access systems with cardholder data. However, Requirements 8.1, 8.2 and 8.5.8 through 8.5.15 are not
intended to apply to user accounts within a point-of-sale payment application that only have access to one card number at a time in order to
facilitate a single transaction (such as cashier accounts).

PCI DSS Requirements

Testing Procedures

8.1 Assign all users a unique ID before
allowing them to access system
components or cardholder data.

8.1 Verify that all users are assigned a unique ID for access to
system components or cardholder data.

8.2 In addition to assigning a unique ID,
employ at least one of the following
methods to authenticate all users:

8.2 To verify that users are authenticated using unique ID and
additional authentication (for example, a password) for access to
the cardholder data environment, perform the following:



Something you know, such as a
password or passphrase



Obtain and examine documentation describing the
authentication method(s) used.



Something you have, such as a
token device or smart card





Something you are, such as a
biometric

For each type of authentication method used and for each type
of system component, observe an authentication to verify
authentication is functioning consistent with documented
authentication method(s).

8.3 To verify that two-factor authentication is implemented for all
remote network access, observe an employee (for example, an
administrator) connecting remotely to the network and verify that
two of the three authentication methods are used.

Note: Two-factor authentication requires
that two of the three authentication
methods (see Requirement 8.2 for
descriptions of authentication methods)
be used for authentication. Using one
factor twice (for example, using two
separate passwords) is not considered
two-factor authentication.
8.4 Render all passwords unreadable
during transmission and storage on all
system components using strong
cryptography.

8.4.a For a sample of system components, examine password files
to verify that passwords are unreadable during transmission and
storage.

8.5 Ensure proper user identification and

system components as follows:

8.5 Review procedures and interview personnel to verify that
procedures are implemented for user identification and
authentication management, by performing the following:

8.5.1 Control addition, deletion, and
modification of user IDs, credentials,
and other identifier objects.

8.4.b For service providers only, observe password files to verify
that customer passwords are encrypted.

8.5.1 Select a sample of user IDs, including both administrators
and general users. Verify that each user is authorized to use the
system according to policy by performing the following:
 Obtain and examine an authorization form for each ID.
 Verify that the sampled user IDs are implemented in
accordance with the authorization form (including with
privileges as specified and all signatures obtained), by tracing
information from the authorization form to the system.

Appendix A: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Shared Hosting Providers
Requirement A.1: Shared hosting providers must protect the cardholder data environment
As referenced in Requirement 12.8, all service providers with access to cardholder data (including shared hosting providers) must adhere to the
PCI DSS. In addition, Requirement 2.4 states that shared hosting providers must protect each entity’s hosted environment and data. Therefore,
shared hosting providers must additionally comply with the requirements in this Appendix.
Requirements

Testing Procedures

A.1 Protect each entity’s (that is
merchant, service provider, or
other entity) hosted
environment and data, per A.1.1
through A.1.4:

A.1 Specifically for a PCI DSS assessment of a shared hosting provider, to
verify that shared hosting providers protect entities’ (merchants and service
providers) hosted environment and data, select a sample of servers
(Microsoft Windows and Unix/Linux) across a representative sample of
hosted merchants and service providers, and perform A.1.1 through A.1.4
below:

A hosting provider must fulfill
these requirements as well as
all other relevant sections of the
PCI DSS.

In Place

Not in
Place

Target Date/
Comments

Note: Even though a hosting
provider may meet these
requirements, the compliance of
the entity that uses the hosting
provider is not guaranteed.
Each entity must comply with
the PCI DSS and validate
compliance as applicable.
A.1.1 Ensure that each entity
only runs processes that have
access to that entity’s
cardholder data environment.

A.1.1 If a shared hosting provider allows entities (for example, merchants
or service providers) to run their own applications, verify these application
processes run using the unique ID of the entity. For example:
No entity on the system can use a shared web server user ID.
All CGI scripts used by an entity must be created and run as the entity’s
unique user ID.

A.1.2.a Verify the user ID of any application process is not a privileged
user (root/admin).
A.1.2.b Verify each entity (merchant, service provider) has read, write, or
execute permissions only for files and directories it owns or for necessary
system files (restricted via file system permissions, access control lists,
chroot, jailshell, etc.)
Important: An entity’s files may not be shared by group.
A.1.2.c Verify that an entity’s users do not have write access to shared
system binaries.
A.1.2.d Verify that viewing of log entries is restricted to the owning entity.
A.1.2.e To ensure each entity cannot monopolize server resources to
exploit vulnerabilities (for example, error, race, and restart conditions,
resulting in, for example, buffer overflows), verify restrictions are in place
for the use of these system resources:
 Disk space
 Bandwidth
 Memory
 CPU

A.1.3 Ensure logging and
audit trails are enabled and
unique to each entity’s
cardholder data environment
and consistent with PCI DSS
Requirement 10.

A.1.3 Verify the shared hosting provider has enabled logging as follows,
for each merchant and service provider environment:
Logs are enabled for common third-party applications.
Logs are active by default.
Logs are available for review by the owning entity.
Log locations are clearly communicated to the owning entity.

A.1.4 Enable processes to
provide for timely forensic
investigation in the event of a
compromise to any hosted
merchant or service provider.

A.1.4 Verify the shared hosting provider has written policies that provide
for a timely forensics investigation of related servers in the event of a
compromise.

Appendix B: Compensating Controls
Compensating controls may be considered for most PCI DSS requirements when an entity cannot meet a
requirement explicitly as stated, due to legitimate technical or documented business constraints, but has
sufficiently mitigated the risk associated with the requirement through implementation of other, or
compensating, controls.
Compensating controls must satisfy the following criteria:
1. Meet the intent and rigor of the original PCI DSS requirement.
2. Provide a similar level of defense as the original PCI DSS requirement, such that the compensating
control sufficiently offsets the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to defend
against. (See Navigating PCI DSS for the intent of each PCI DSS requirement.)
3. Be ―above and beyond‖ other PCI DSS requirements. (Simply being in compliance with other PCI
DSS requirements is not a compensating control.)
When evaluating ―above and beyond‖ for compensating controls, consider the following:
Note: The items at a) through c) below are intended as examples only. All compensating controls must be
reviewed and validated for sufficiency by the assessor who conducts the PCI DSS review. The
effectiveness of a compensating control is dependent on the specifics of the environment in which the
control is implemented, the surrounding security controls, and the configuration of the control. Companies
should be aware that a particular compensating control will not be effective in all environments.
a) Existing PCI DSS requirements CANNOT be considered as compensating controls if they are
already required for the item under review. For example, passwords for non-console
administrative access must be sent encrypted to mitigate the risk of intercepting clear-text
administrative passwords. An entity cannot use other PCI DSS password requirements (intruder
lockout, complex passwords, etc.) to compensate for lack of encrypted passwords, since those
other password requirements do not mitigate the risk of interception of clear-text passwords. Also,
the other password controls are already PCI DSS requirements for the item under review
(passwords).
b) Existing PCI DSS requirements MAY be considered as compensating controls if they are required
for another area, but are not required for the item under review. For example, two-factor
authentication is a PCI DSS requirement for remote access. Two-factor authentication from within
the internal network can also be considered as a compensating control for non-console
administrative access when transmission of encrypted passwords cannot be supported. Twofactor authentication may be an acceptable compensating control if: (1) it meets the intent of the
original requirement by addressing the risk of intercepting clear-text administrative passwords;
and (2) it is set up properly and in a secure environment.
c) Existing PCI DSS requirements may be combined with new controls to become a compensating
control. For example, if a company is unable to render cardholder data unreadable per
Requirement 3.4 (for example, by encryption), a compensating control could consist of a device
or combination of devices, applications, and controls that address all of the following: (1) internal
network segmentation; (2) IP address or MAC address filtering; and (3) two-factor authentication
from within the internal network.
4. Be commensurate with the additional risk imposed by not adhering to the PCI DSS requirement
The assessor is required to thoroughly evaluate compensating controls during each annual PCI DSS
assessment to validate that each compensating control adequately addresses the risk the original PCI
DSS requirement was designed to address, per items 1-4 above. To maintain compliance, processes and
controls must be in place to ensure compensating controls remain effective after the assessment is
complete.

Appendix C: Compensating Controls Worksheet
Use this worksheet to define compensating controls for any requirement where compensating controls
are used to meet a PCI DSS requirement. Note that compensating controls should also be documented in
the Report on Compliance in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section.
Note: Only companies that have undertaken a risk analysis and have legitimate technological or
documented business constraints can consider the use of compensating controls to achieve compliance.
Requirement Number and Definition:

Information Required
1. Constraints

List constraints precluding compliance
with the original requirement.

2. Objective

Define the objective of the original
control; identify the objective met by the
compensating control.

3. Identified Risk

Identify any additional risk posed by the
lack of the original control.

4. Definition of
Compensating
Controls

Define the compensating controls and
explain how they address the objectives
of the original control and the increased
risk, if any.

5. Validation of
Compensating
Controls

Define how the compensating controls
were validated and tested.

6. Maintenance

Define process and controls in place to
maintain compensating controls.

Compensating Controls Worksheet – Completed Example
Use this worksheet to define compensating controls for any requirement noted as ―in place‖ via
compensating controls.
Requirement Number: 8.1—Are all users identified with a unique user name before allowing them to
access system components or cardholder data?
Information Required

Explanation

1. Constraints

List constraints precluding
compliance with the original
requirement.

Company XYZ employs stand-alone Unix
Servers without LDAP. As such, they each
require a ―root‖ login. It is not possible for
Company XYZ to manage the ―root‖ login nor
is it feasible to log all ―root‖ activity by each
user.

2. Objective

Define the objective of the
original control; identify the
objective met by the
compensating control.

The objective of requiring unique logins is
twofold. First, it is not considered acceptable
from a security perspective to share login
credentials. Secondly, having shared logins
makes it impossible to state definitively that a
person is responsible for a particular action.

3. Identified Risk

Identify any additional risk
posed by the lack of the
original control.

Additional risk is introduced to the access
control system by not ensuring all users have
a unique ID and are able to be tracked.

4. Definition of
Compensating
Controls

Define the compensating
controls and explain how
they address the objectives
of the original control and
the increased risk, if any.

Company XYZ is going to require all users to
log into the servers from their desktops using
the SU command. SU allows a user to access
the ―root‖ account and perform actions under
the ―root‖ account but is able to be logged in
the SU-log directory. In this way, each user‘s
actions can be tracked through the SU
account.

5. Validation of
Compensating
Controls

Define how the
compensating controls were
validated and tested.

Company XYZ demonstrates to assessor that
the SU command being executed and that
those individuals utilizing the command are
logged to identify that the individual is
performing actions under root privileges.

6. Maintenance

Define process and controls
in place to maintain
compensating controls.

Company XYZ documents processes and
procedures to ensure SU configurations are
not changed, altered, or removed to allow
individual users to execute root commands
without being individually tracked or logged.
