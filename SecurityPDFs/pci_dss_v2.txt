Introduction and PCI Data Security Standard Overview
The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) was developed to encourage and enhance cardholder data security and facilitate
the broad adoption of consistent data security measures globally. PCI DSS provides a baseline of technical and operational requirements
designed to protect cardholder data. PCI DSS applies to all entities involved in payment card processing – including merchants, processors,
acquirers, issuers, and service providers, as well as all other entities that store, process or transmit cardholder data. PCI DSS comprises a
minimum set of requirements for protecting cardholder data, and may be enhanced by additional controls and practices to further mitigate risks.
Below is a high-level overview of the 12 PCI DSS requirements.

This document, PCI Data Security Standard Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures, combines the 12 PCI DSS requirements and
corresponding testing procedures into a security assessment tool. It is designed for use during PCI DSS compliance assessments as part of an
entity’s validation process. The following sections provide detailed guidelines and best practices to assist entities prepare for, conduct, and report
the results of a PCI DSS assessment. The PCI DSS Requirements and Testing Procedures begin on page 19.

PCI DSS Applicability Information
PCI DSS applies wherever account data is stored, processed or transmitted. Account Data consists of Cardholder Data plus Sensitive
Authentication Data, as follows:
Cardholder Data includes:


Primary Account Number (PAN)



Cardholder Name




Sensitive Authentication Data includes:


Full magnetic stripe data or equivalent
on a chip

Expiration Date



CAV2/CVC2/CVV2/CID

Service Code



PINs/PIN blocks

The primary account number is the defining factor in the applicability of PCI DSS requirements. PCI DSS requirements are applicable if a
primary account number (PAN) is stored, processed, or transmitted. If PAN is not stored, processed or transmitted, PCI DSS requirements do not
apply.
If cardholder name, service code, and/or expiration date are stored, processed or transmitted with the PAN, or are otherwise present in the
cardholder data environment, they must be protected in accordance with all PCI DSS requirements except Requirements 3.3 and 3.4, which apply
only to PAN.
PCI DSS represents a minimum set of control objectives which may be enhanced by local, regional and sector laws and regulations. Additionally,
legislation or regulatory requirements may require specific protection of personally identifiable information or other data elements (for example,
cardholder name), or define an entity’s disclosure practices related to consumer information. Examples include legislation related to consumer
data protection, privacy, identity theft, or data security. PCI DSS does not supersede local or regional laws, government regulations, or other legal
requirements.
The following table illustrates commonly used elements of cardholder and sensitive authentication data, whether storage of each data element is
permitted or prohibited, and whether each data element must be protected. This table is not exhaustive, but is presented to illustrate the different
types of requirements that apply to each data element.

Relationship between PCI DSS and PA-DSS
Use of a PA-DSS compliant application by itself does not make an entity PCI DSS compliant, since that application must be implemented into a
PCI DSS compliant environment and according to the PA-DSS Implementation Guide provided by the payment application vendor (per PA-DSS
Requirement 13.1).
The requirements for the Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS) are derived from the PCI DSS Requirements and Security
Assessment Procedures (this document). The PA-DSS details what a payment application must support to facilitate a customer’s PCI DSS
compliance.
Secure payment applications, when implemented in a PCI DSS-compliant environment, will minimize the potential for security breaches leading to
compromises of full magnetic stripe data, card verification codes and values (CAV2, CID, CVC2, CVV2), and PINs and PIN blocks, along with the
damaging fraud resulting from these breaches.
Just a few of the ways payment applications can prevent compliance include:


Storage of magnetic stripe data and/or equivalent data from the chip in the customer's network after authorization;



Applications that require customers to disable other features required by the PCI DSS, like anti-virus software or firewalls, in order to get
the payment application to work properly; and



Vendors’ use of unsecured methods to connect to the application to provide support to the customer.

The PA-DSS applies to software vendors and others who develop payment applications that store, process, or transmit cardholder data as part of
authorization or settlement, where these payment applications are sold, distributed, or licensed to third parties.
Please note the following regarding PA-DSS applicability:


PA-DSS does apply to payment applications that are typically sold and installed ―off the shelf‖ without much customization by software
vendors.



PA-DSS does not apply to payment applications developed by merchants and service providers if used only in-house (not sold,
distributed, or licensed to a third party), since this in-house developed payment application would be covered as part of the merchant’s or
service provider’s normal PCI DSS compliance.

For detailed guidance on determining whether PA-DSS applies to a given payment application, please refer to the PA-DSS Requirements and
Security Assessment Procedures, which can be found at www.pcisecuritystandards.org.

Scope of Assessment for Compliance with PCI DSS Requirements
The PCI DSS security requirements apply to all system components. In the context of PCI DSS, ―system components‖ are defined as any network
component, server, or application that is included in or connected to the cardholder data environment. ―System components‖ also include any
virtualization components such as virtual machines, virtual switches/routers, virtual appliances, virtual applications/desktops, and hypervisors. The
cardholder data environment is comprised of people, processes and technology that store, process or transmit cardholder data or sensitive
authentication data. Network components include but are not limited to firewalls, switches, routers, wireless access points, network appliances,
and other security appliances. Server types include, but are not limited to the following: web, application, database, authentication, mail, proxy,
network time protocol (NTP), and domain name server (DNS). Applications include all purchased and custom applications, including internal and
external (for example, Internet) applications.
The first step of a PCI DSS assessment is to accurately determine the scope of the review. At least annually and prior to the annual assessment,
the assessed entity should confirm the accuracy of their PCI DSS scope by identifying all locations and flows of cardholder data and ensuring they
are included in the PCI DSS scope. To confirm the accuracy and appropriateness of PCI DSS scope, perform the following:


The assessed entity identifies and documents the existence of all cardholder data in their environment, to verify that no cardholder data
exists outside of the currently defined cardholder data environment (CDE).



Once all locations of cardholder data are identified and documented, the entity uses the results to verify that PCI DSS scope is appropriate
(for example, the results may be a diagram or an inventory of cardholder data locations).



The entity considers any cardholder data found to be in scope of the PCI DSS assessment and part of the CDE unless such data is
deleted or migrated/consolidated into the currently defined CDE.



The entity retains documentation that shows how PCI DSS scope was confirmed and the results, for assessor review and/or for reference
during the next annual PCI SCC scope confirmation activity.

Network Segmentation
Network segmentation of, or isolating (segmenting), the cardholder data environment from the remainder of an entity’s network is not a PCI DSS
requirement. However, it is strongly recommended as a method that may reduce:


The scope of the PCI DSS assessment



The cost of the PCI DSS assessment



The cost and difficulty of implementing and maintaining PCI DSS controls



The risk to an organization (reduced by consolidating cardholder data into fewer, more controlled locations)

Page 10

Without adequate network segmentation (sometimes called a "flat network") the entire network is in scope of the PCI DSS assessment. Network
segmentation can be achieved through a number of physical or logical means, such as properly configured internal network firewalls, routers with
strong access control lists, or other technologies that restrict access to a particular segment of a network.
An important prerequisite to reduce the scope of the cardholder data environment is a clear understanding of business needs and processes
related to the storage, processing or transmission of cardholder data. Restricting cardholder data to as few locations as possible by elimination of
unnecessary data, and consolidation of necessary data, may require reengineering of long-standing business practices.
Documenting cardholder data flows via a dataflow diagram helps fully understand all cardholder data flows and ensures that any network
segmentation is effective at isolating the cardholder data environment.
If network segmentation is in place and being used to reduce the scope of the PCI DSS assessment, the assessor must verify that the
segmentation is adequate to reduce the scope of the assessment. At a high level, adequate network segmentation isolates systems that store,
process, or transmit cardholder data from those that do not. However, the adequacy of a specific implementation of network segmentation is highly
variable and dependent upon a number of factors, such as a given network's configuration, the technologies deployed, and other controls that may
be implemented.
Appendix D: Segmentation and Sampling of Business Facilities/System Components provides more information on the effect of network
segmentation and sampling on the scope of a PCI DSS assessment.

Wireless
If wireless technology is used to store, process, or transmit cardholder data (for example, point-of-sale transactions, ―line-busting‖), or if a wireless
local area network (WLAN) is connected to, or part of, the cardholder data environment (for example, not clearly separated by a firewall), the PCI
DSS requirements and testing procedures for wireless environments apply and must be performed (for example, Requirements 1.2.3, 2.1.1, and
4.1.1). Before wireless technology is implemented, an entity should carefully evaluate the need for the technology against the risk. Consider
deploying wireless technology only for non-sensitive data transmission.

Third Parties/Outsourcing
For service providers required to undergo an annual onsite assessment, compliance validation must be performed on all system components in
the cardholder data environment.
A service provider or merchant may use a third-party service provider to store, process, or transmit cardholder data on their behalf, or to manage
components such as routers, firewalls, databases, physical security, and/or servers. If so, there may be an impact on the security of the cardholder
data environment.
For those entities that outsource storage, processing, or transmission of cardholder data to third-party service providers, the Report on
Compliance (ROC) must document the role of each service provider, clearly identifying which requirements apply to the assessed entity and which
apply to the service provider. There are two options for third-party service providers to validate compliance:

PCI DSS Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures, Version 2.0
Copyright 2010 PCI Security Standards Council LLC

October 2010
Page 11

1) They can undergo a PCI DSS assessment on their own and provide evidence to their customers to demonstrate their compliance; or
2) If they do not undergo their own PCI DSS assessment, they will need to have their services reviewed during the course of each of their
customers’ PCI DSS assessments.
See the bullet beginning ―For managed service provider (MSP) reviews,‖ in Item 3, ―Details about Reviewed Environment,‖ in the ―Instructions and
Content for Report on Compliance‖ section, below, for more information.
Additionally, merchants and service providers must manage and monitor the PCI DSS compliance of all associated third-party service providers
with access to cardholder data. Refer to Requirement 12.8 in this document for details.

Sampling of Business Facilities/System Components
Sampling is not a PCI DSS requirement. However, after considering the overall scope and complexity of the environment being assessed, the
assessor may independently select representative samples of business facilities/system components in order to assess PCI DSS requirements.
These samples must be defined first for business facilities and then for system components within each selected business facility. Samples must
be a representative selection of all of the types and locations of business facilities, as well as types of system components within selected
business facilities. Samples must be sufficiently large to provide the assessor with assurance that controls are implemented as expected.
Sampling of business facilities/system components for an assessment does not reduce the scope of the cardholder data environment or the
applicability of PCI DSS requirements. Whether or not sampling is to be used, PCI DSS requirements apply to the entire cardholder data
environment. If sampling is used, each sample must be assessed against all applicable PCI DSS requirements. Sampling of the PCI DSS
Requirements themselves is not permitted.
Examples of business facilities include but are not limited to: corporate offices, stores, franchise locations, processing facilities, data centers, and
other facility types in different locations. Sampling should include system components within each selected business facility. For example, for each
business facility selected, include a variety of operating systems, functions, and applications that are applicable to the area under review.
As an example, the assessor may define a sample at a business facility to include Sun servers running Apache WWW, Windows servers running
Oracle, mainframe systems running legacy card processing applications, data transfer servers running HP-UX, and Linux Servers running
MYSQL. If all applications run from a single version of an OS (for example, Windows 7 or Solaris 10), then the sample should still include a variety
of applications (for example, database servers, web servers, data transfer servers).
When independently selecting samples of business facilities/system components, assessors should consider the following:


If there are standard, centralized PCI DSS security and operational processes and controls in place that ensure consistency and that each
business facility/system component must follow, the sample can be smaller than if there are no standard processes/controls in place. The
sample must be large enough to provide the assessor with reasonable assurance that all business facilities/system components are
configured per the standard processes.



If there is more than one type of standard security and/or operational process in place (for example, for different types of business
facilities/system components), the sample must be large enough to include business facilities/system components secured with each type
of process.

October 2010
Page 12



If there are no standard PCI DSS processes/controls in place and each business facility/system component is managed through nonstandard processes, the sample must be larger for the assessor to be assured that each business facility/system component has
implemented PCI DSS requirements appropriately.

For each instance where sampling is used, the assessor must:


Document the rationale behind the sampling technique and sample size,



Document and validate the standardized PCI DSS processes and controls used to determine sample
size, and



Explain how the sample is appropriate and representative of the overall population.

Please also refer to:
Appendix D: Segmentation
and Sampling of Business
Facilities/System
Components.

Assessors must revalidate the sampling rationale for each assessment. If sampling is to be used, different
samples of business facilities and system components must be selected for each assessment.

Compensating Controls
On an annual basis, any compensating controls must be documented, reviewed and validated by the assessor and included with the Report on
Compliance submission, per Appendix B: Compensating Controls and Appendix C: Compensating Controls Worksheet.
For each and every compensating control, the Compensating Controls Worksheet (Appendix C) must be completed. Additionally, compensating
control results should be documented in the ROC in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section.
See the above-mentioned Appendices B and C for more details on ―compensating controls.‖

4. Contact Information and Report Date
Include:


Contact information for merchant or service provider and assessor



Timeframe of assessment—specify the duration and the time period over which the assessment occurred



Date of report

5. Quarterly Scan Results


Summarize the four most recent quarterly ASV scan results in the Executive Summary as well as in comments at Requirement
11.2.2.
Note: It is not required that four passing quarterly scans must be completed for initial PCI DSS compliance if the assessor
verifies:
1) The most recent scan result was a passing scan,
2) The entity has documented policies and procedures requiring quarterly scanning going forward, and
3) Any vulnerabilities noted in the initial scan have been corrected as shown in a re-scan.
For subsequent years after the initial PCI DSS review, four passing quarterly scans must have occurred.



Scan must cover all externally accessible (Internet-facing) IP addresses in existence at the entity, in accordance with the PCI
Approved Scanning Vendors (ASV) Program Guide.

6. Findings and Observations
Summarize in the Executive Summary any findings that may not fit into the standard Report on Compliance template format.
All assessors must:
 Use the Detailed PCI DSS Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures template to provide detailed report descriptions
and findings on each requirement and sub-requirement.
 Ensure that all N/A responses are clearly explained.
 Review and document any compensating controls considered to conclude that a control is in place.
See ―Compensating Controls‖ section above and Appendices B and C for more details on compensating controls.

Revalidation of Open Items
A ―controls in place‖ report is required to verify compliance. The report is considered non-compliant if it contains ―open items,‖ or items that will be
finished at a future date. The merchant/service provider must address these items before validation is completed. After open items are addressed
by the merchant/service provider, the assessor will then reassess to validate that the remediation occurred and that all requirements are satisfied.
After revalidation, the assessor will issue a new Report on Compliance, verifying that the cardholder data environment is fully compliant, and
submit it consistent with instructions (see below).

Detailed PCI DSS Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures
For the PCI DSS Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures, the following defines the table column headings:


PCI DSS Requirements – This column defines the Data Security Standard and lists requirements to achieve PCI DSS compliance;
compliance will be validated against these requirements.



Testing Procedures – This column shows processes to be followed by the assessor to validate that PCI DSS requirements are ―in place.‖



In Place – This column must be used by the assessor to provide a brief description of
the controls which were validated as ―in place‖ for each requirement, including
descriptions of controls found to be in place as a result of compensating controls, or as a
result of a requirement being ―Not Applicable.‖

Build and Maintain a Secure Network
Requirement 1: Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data
Firewalls are devices that control computer traffic allowed between an entity’s networks (internal) and untrusted networks (external), as well as
traffic into and out of more sensitive areas within an entity’s internal trusted networks. The cardholder data environment is an example of a more
sensitive area within an entity’s trusted network.
A firewall examines all network traffic and blocks those transmissions that do not meet the specified security criteria.
All systems must be protected from unauthorized access from untrusted networks, whether entering the system via the Internet as e-commerce,
employee Internet access through desktop browsers, employee e-mail access, dedicated connections such as business-to-business connections,
via wireless networks, or via other sources. Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways
into key systems. Firewalls are a key protection mechanism for any computer network.
Other system components may provide firewall functionality, provided they meet the minimum requirements for firewalls as provided in
Requirement 1. Where other system components are used within the cardholder data environment to provide firewall functionality, these devices
must be included within the scope and assessment of Requirement 1.

Protect Cardholder Data
Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data
Protection methods such as encryption, truncation, masking, and hashing are critical components of cardholder data protection. If an intruder
circumvents other security controls and gains access to encrypted data, without the proper cryptographic keys, the data is unreadable and
unusable to that person. Other effective methods of protecting stored data should be considered as potential risk mitigation opportunities. For
example, methods for minimizing risk include not storing cardholder data unless absolutely necessary, truncating cardholder data if full PAN is not
needed, and not sending unprotected PANs using end-user messaging technologies, such as e-mail and instant messaging.
Please refer to the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms for definitions of ―strong cryptography‖ and other PCI
DSS terms.

3.4 Render PAN unreadable anywhere it
is stored (including on portable digital

using any of the following approaches:
 One-way hashes based on strong
cryptography (hash must be of the
entire PAN)
 Truncation (hashing cannot be used
to replace the truncated segment of
PAN)
 Index tokens and pads (pads must
be securely stored)
 Strong cryptography with associated
key-management processes and
procedures

3.4.a Obtain and examine documentation about the system used to
protect the PAN, including the vendor, type of system/process, and
the encryption algorithms (if applicable). Verify that the PAN is
rendered unreadable using any of the following methods:
 One-way hashes based on strong cryptography
 Truncation
 Index tokens and pads, with the pads being securely stored
 Strong cryptography, with associated key-management
processes and procedures

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a
malicious individual to reconstruct original
PAN data if they have access to both the
truncated and hashed version of a PAN.
Where hashed and truncated versions of
the same PAN are present in an entity‘s
environment, additional controls should
be in place to ensure that the hashed and
truncated versions cannot be correlated
to reconstruct the original PAN.
3.4.1 If disk encryption is used (rather
than file- or column-level database
encryption), logical access must be
managed independently of native

Requirement 6: Develop and maintain secure systems and applications
Unscrupulous individuals use security vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to systems. Many of these vulnerabilities are fixed by vendorprovided security patches, which must be installed by the entities that manage the systems. All critical systems must have the most recently
released, appropriate software patches to protect against exploitation and compromise of cardholder data by malicious individuals and malicious
software.
Note: Appropriate software patches are those patches that have been evaluated and tested sufficiently to determine that the patches do not
conflict with existing security configurations. For in-house developed applications, numerous vulnerabilities can be avoided by using standard
system development processes and secure coding techniques.
PCI DSS Requirements

Testing Procedures

6.1 Ensure that all system components
and software are protected from known
vulnerabilities by having the latest
vendor-supplied security patches
installed. Install critical security patches
within one month of release.
Note: An organization may consider
applying a risk-based approach to
prioritize their patch installations. For
example, by prioritizing critical
infrastructure (for example, public-facing
devices and systems, databases) higher
than less-critical internal devices, to
ensure high-priority systems and devices
are addressed within one month, and
addressing less critical devices and
systems within three months.

Requirement 8: Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access
Assigning a unique identification (ID) to each person with access ensures that each individual is uniquely accountable for his or her actions. When
such accountability is in place, actions taken on critical data and systems are performed by, and can be traced to, known and authorized users.
Note: These requirements are applicable for all accounts, including point-of-sale accounts, with administrative capabilities and all accounts used
to view or access cardholder data or to access systems with cardholder data. However, Requirements 8.1, 8.2 and 8.5.8 through 8.5.15 are not
intended to apply to user accounts within a point-of-sale payment application that only have access to one card number at a time in order to
facilitate a single transaction (such as cashier accounts).

PCI DSS Requirements

Testing Procedures

8.1 Assign all users a unique ID before
allowing them to access system
components or cardholder data.

8.1 Verify that all users are assigned a unique ID for access to
system components or cardholder data.

Appendix A: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Shared Hosting Providers
Requirement A.1: Shared hosting providers must protect the cardholder data environment
As referenced in Requirement 12.8, all service providers with access to cardholder data (including shared hosting providers) must adhere to the
PCI DSS. In addition, Requirement 2.4 states that shared hosting providers must protect each entity’s hosted environment and data. Therefore,
shared hosting providers must additionally comply with the requirements in this Appendix.
Requirements

Testing Procedures

A.1 Protect each entity’s (that is
merchant, service provider, or
other entity) hosted
environment and data, per A.1.1
through A.1.4:

A.1 Specifically for a PCI DSS assessment of a shared hosting provider, to
verify that shared hosting providers protect entities’ (merchants and service
providers) hosted environment and data, select a sample of servers
(Microsoft Windows and Unix/Linux) across a representative sample of
hosted merchants and service providers, and perform A.1.1 through A.1.4
below:

A hosting provider must fulfill
these requirements as well as
all other relevant sections of the
PCI DSS.

In Place

Not in

Target Date/
Comments

Note: Even though a hosting
provider may meet these
requirements, the compliance of
the entity that uses the hosting
provider is not guaranteed.
Each entity must comply with
the PCI DSS and validate
compliance as applicable.
A.1.1 Ensure that each entity
only runs processes that have
access to that entity’s
cardholder data environment.

A.1.1 If a shared hosting provider allows entities (for example, merchants
or service providers) to run their own applications, verify these application
processes run using the unique ID of the entity. For example:
No entity on the system can use a shared web server user ID.
All CGI scripts used by an entity must be created and run as the entity’s
unique user ID.

A.1.2.a Verify the user ID of any application process is not a privileged
user (root/admin).
A.1.2.b Verify each entity (merchant, service provider) has read, write, or
execute permissions only for files and directories it owns or for necessary
system files (restricted via file system permissions, access control lists,
chroot, jailshell, etc.)
Important: An entity’s files may not be shared by group.
A.1.2.c Verify that an entity’s users do not have write access to shared
system binaries.
A.1.2.d Verify that viewing of log entries is restricted to the owning entity.
A.1.2.e To ensure each entity cannot monopolize server resources to
exploit vulnerabilities (for example, error, race, and restart conditions,
resulting in, for example, buffer overflows), verify restrictions are in place
for the use of these system resources:
 Disk space
 Bandwidth
 Memory
 CPU

A.1.3 Ensure logging and
audit trails are enabled and
unique to each entity’s
cardholder data environment
and consistent with PCI DSS
Requirement 10.

A.1.3 Verify the shared hosting provider has enabled logging as follows,
for each merchant and service provider environment:
Logs are enabled for common third-party applications.
Logs are active by default.
Logs are available for review by the owning entity.
Log locations are clearly communicated to the owning entity.

A.1.4 Enable processes to
provide for timely forensic
investigation in the event of a
compromise to any hosted
merchant or service provider.

A.1.4 Verify the shared hosting provider has written policies that provide
for a timely forensics investigation of related servers in the event of a
compromise.

Appendix B: Compensating Controls
Compensating controls may be considered for most PCI DSS requirements when an entity cannot meet a
requirement explicitly as stated, due to legitimate technical or documented business constraints, but has
sufficiently mitigated the risk associated with the requirement through implementation of other, or
compensating, controls.
Compensating controls must satisfy the following criteria:
1. Meet the intent and rigor of the original PCI DSS requirement.
2. Provide a similar level of defense as the original PCI DSS requirement, such that the compensating
control sufficiently offsets the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to defend
against. (See Navigating PCI DSS for the intent of each PCI DSS requirement.)
3. Be ―above and beyond‖ other PCI DSS requirements. (Simply being in compliance with other PCI
DSS requirements is not a compensating control.)
When evaluating ―above and beyond‖ for compensating controls, consider the following:
Note: The items at a) through c) below are intended as examples only. All compensating controls must be
reviewed and validated for sufficiency by the assessor who conducts the PCI DSS review. The
effectiveness of a compensating control is dependent on the specifics of the environment in which the
control is implemented, the surrounding security controls, and the configuration of the control. Companies
should be aware that a particular compensating control will not be effective in all environments.
a) Existing PCI DSS requirements CANNOT be considered as compensating controls if they are
already required for the item under review. For example, passwords for non-console
administrative access must be sent encrypted to mitigate the risk of intercepting clear-text
administrative passwords. An entity cannot use other PCI DSS password requirements (intruder
lockout, complex passwords, etc.) to compensate for lack of encrypted passwords, since those
other password requirements do not mitigate the risk of interception of clear-text passwords. Also,
the other password controls are already PCI DSS requirements for the item under review
(passwords).
b) Existing PCI DSS requirements MAY be considered as compensating controls if they are required
for another area, but are not required for the item under review. For example, two-factor
authentication is a PCI DSS requirement for remote access. Two-factor authentication from within
the internal network can also be considered as a compensating control for non-console
administrative access when transmission of encrypted passwords cannot be supported. Twofactor authentication may be an acceptable compensating control if: (1) it meets the intent of the
original requirement by addressing the risk of intercepting clear-text administrative passwords;
and (2) it is set up properly and in a secure environment.
c) Existing PCI DSS requirements may be combined with new controls to become a compensating
control. For example, if a company is unable to render cardholder data unreadable per
Requirement 3.4 (for example, by encryption), a compensating control could consist of a device
or combination of devices, applications, and controls that address all of the following: (1) internal
network segmentation; (2) IP address or MAC address filtering; and (3) two-factor authentication
from within the internal network.
4. Be commensurate with the additional risk imposed by not adhering to the PCI DSS requirement
The assessor is required to thoroughly evaluate compensating controls during each annual PCI DSS
assessment to validate that each compensating control adequately addresses the risk the original PCI
DSS requirement was designed to address, per items 1-4 above. To maintain compliance, processes and
controls must be in place to ensure compensating controls remain effective after the assessment is
complete.

Appendix C: Compensating Controls Worksheet
Use this worksheet to define compensating controls for any requirement where compensating controls
are used to meet a PCI DSS requirement. Note that compensating controls should also be documented in
the Report on Compliance in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section.
Note: Only companies that have undertaken a risk analysis and have legitimate technological or
documented business constraints can consider the use of compensating controls to achieve compliance.

Compensating Controls Worksheet – Completed Example
Use this worksheet to define compensating controls for any requirement noted as ―in place‖ via
compensating controls.
Requirement Number: 8.1—Are all users identified with a unique user name before allowing them to
access system components or cardholder data?
Information Required

Explanation

1. Constraints

List constraints precluding
compliance with the original
requirement.

Company XYZ employs stand-alone Unix
Servers without LDAP. As such, they each
require a ―root‖ login. It is not possible for
Company XYZ to manage the ―root‖ login nor
is it feasible to log all ―root‖ activity by each
user.

2. Objective

Define the objective of the
original control; identify the
objective met by the
compensating control.

The objective of requiring unique logins is
twofold. First, it is not considered acceptable
from a security perspective to share login
credentials. Secondly, having shared logins
makes it impossible to state definitively that a
person is responsible for a particular action.

3. Identified Risk

Identify any additional risk
posed by the lack of the
original control.

Additional risk is introduced to the access
control system by not ensuring all users have
a unique ID and are able to be tracked.

4. Definition of
Compensating
Controls

Define the compensating
controls and explain how
they address the objectives
of the original control and
the increased risk, if any.

Company XYZ is going to require all users to
log into the servers from their desktops using
the SU command. SU allows a user to access
the ―root‖ account and perform actions under
the ―root‖ account but is able to be logged in
the SU-log directory. In this way, each user‘s
actions can be tracked through the SU
account.

5. Validation of
Compensating
Controls

Define how the
compensating controls were
validated and tested.

Company XYZ demonstrates to assessor that
the SU command being executed and that
those individuals utilizing the command are
logged to identify that the individual is
performing actions under root privileges.

6. Maintenance

Define process and controls
in place to maintain
compensating controls.

Company XYZ documents processes and
procedures to ensure SU configurations are
not changed, altered, or removed to allow
individual users to execute root commands
without being individually tracked or logged.
